Abstract:
-----------------

Background:
Thrombosis of centrally inserted vascular catheters (CVADs) is a common problem that can be detrimental to the health of hospitalized patients. In this research, we performed a randomized controlled trial with a recombinant urokinase (r-UK) for restoration of patency to occluded CVADs in oncology patients. 
Objectives:
To identify r-UK doses and treatment regimens with the most benefits and least complications. 
Study design:
A Phase II, randomized, double-blind, active-control, multicenter, dose-ranging study was performed to compare the safety and efficacy of one or two instillations of three intraluminal concentrations of r-UK (5,000; 15,000; and 25,000 IU/mL) with a placebo for reestablishment of total function to occluded CVADs in oncology patients. 
Method:
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study for reestablishment of total function to occluded CVADs. The study was done in three phases: 1 to compare three different dosing regimens for a single dose to determine the dose with highest potency; 2 to assess the efficacy of a single dose at this dose; and 3 to determine if a second dose is beneficial. All three instillations were done with 5 IU/kg/min (maximum 30 IU/kg/min) for 2 hours. 
Findings:

Background
The use of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion has been encouraged following development of guidelines by a number of professional societies within the past few years. However, not all evidence supports routine prophylaxis, particularly in patients with 'benign' disease indications for PEG insertion.

We therefore compared complications occurring with the pull and push methods, and evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis.

Methods
In a prospective study, 100 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to group A (pull plus antibiotic prophylaxis: amoxycillin-clavulanic acid 3 x 1.2 g i.v. over 24 hours; 37 patients), group B (pull without antibiotic prophylaxis; 34 patients) and group C (push without antibiotic prophylaxis; 29 patients). The indications for PEG placement were dysphagia due to oropharyngeal tumors (56%), neurological disease (32%), or other (12%). Patients were evaluated twice weekly for one month after the PEG placement.

Results
PEG catheters were successfully placed in 96% of the patients. The total procedure-related complication rate was significantly lower in group A than in groups B and C (28%, 58%, and 70%, respectively; p < 0.01). Major complications occurred in one patient in group A (seeding metastasis of a hypopharyngeal carcinoma in the gastrostomy tract), and in four patients in group B (three cases of peritonitis and one aspiration, resulting in two deaths), but in none of the group C patients. Group A patients experienced fewer peristomal infections than the other two groups (14%, 30%, and 41%, respectively: p = 0.05). The risk of peristomal pain was similar (11%, 15%, and 1"
2,"Brief summary of the main findings: For 13 of the 21 studies, it seems that low salt diets have had a positive effect on controlling the blood pressure, although there are only 2 RCTs, which are difficult to interpret due to low participant retention and lack of control groups. There does not seem to be general, strong evidence supporting the benefits of using low-salt diets in the prevention of hypertension.

3,"12 women with primary or secondary infertility (mean aged 31 yr; 6/12 used clomiphene) completed 18 controlled ovulation cycles. HFSH was used in 11 cycles, and HMG in 2 cycles. The dose of human menopausal gonadotrophin in 10 of the cycles was 75 IU, and in 7 of the cycles it was 150 IU. Ovulation was induced with 5000 U HCG and 10 000 U Ovitrelle(R). 24 hours after HCG, transvaginal ultrasound revealed mature follicles with a mean diameter of 18 mm, with 4-8 follicles in 11 cycles and 9-10 follicles in 3 cycles. Oocyte retrieval was performed 36 hours after HCG using a transvaginal ultrasound assisted technique. Progesterone (150 mg Duphaston) was started on the day of oocyte retrieval, continued until 6 weeks post conception, and then tapered off over the next 2 weeks. During the first cycle with HFSH, 43 oocytes were retrieved; in 39 cycles with HMG and HFSH, 207 oocytes were retrieved. The following results were obtained in all 31 retrieval cycles: the total number of oocytes retrieved was 640; fertilization of these oocytes was 66.2 percent; 364/640 (56.7%) embryos were cultured; 140/640 (21.9%) embryos were transferred; 22 embryos were frozen; 12 singletons and 10 sets of twins were conceived; 77.8 percent of the embryos obtained from HMG recipients were transferred, compared with 23.8 percent that were transferred from HFSH recipients; 10.4 percent of embryos obtained from HMG recipients and 0 percent of embryos obtained from HFSH recipients were frozen; and the implantation rate of embryos obtained from HMG recipients ("
4,"Conclusion: No significant treatment effects were observed.
Conclusion: 
Subjects were treated with lamotrigine versus placebo in a double-blind design for 8 weeks. Significant reductions in BPD symptoms and angry mood were observed in both the placebo and lamotrigine group. Thus, while both treatments are probably not effective as treatment of aggression in these patients, at least lamotrigine may affect BPD symptoms and angry mood.

Study #26: Treating borderline personality disorder with varenicline: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Varenicline tartrate (Chantix) is a partial α4β2 agonist and nicotinic receptor antagonist used for smoking cessation. Varenicline has been studied in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and has shown efficacy. Varenicline may produce changes similar to those seen in treatment with non-nicotine psychotropic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and possibly other drugs used for the treatment of mood and other disorders. We propose to conduct a single-site, 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Patients will be given either varenicline or placebo to which they and their clinician will be blinded. The primary outcome of interest is overall improvement in key treatment-resistant symptoms as measured by the Global Clinical Impression (CGI) Scale. Secondary outcome measures will be improvement on clinical scale scores. The investigators' goal is to begin to understand the effects of varenicline in a population of patients with borderline personality disorder with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for these patients.

Background: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) strategic plans for 2015-2020 and the Roadmap for Mental Health Research emphasizes the importance of conducting research for mental illnesses with a high burden of disease. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one such major public health concern. The lifetime prevalence rates of BPD in men and"
5,"The patency and limb salvage rates of synthetical bypass were inferior to that which could be achieved with autologous vein. A vein collar at the distal anastomosis did not have a significant influence on outcome in this study. The study by Schmidt et al. found no significant differences in operative variables or follow-up (both primary and secondary patency 49%) or limb salvage (65%) between the two groups. Similar results were found by Lopes et al. They evaluated 126 patients with critical limb ischaemia who underwent bypass using either synthetic grafts or vein cuff after primary patency (PP) 83% after first bypass, secondary PP 78% after 1, 55% after 2 and 43% after 5 years, 1 and 5 year limb salvage rate 80% and 72% and cumulative limb salvage rate 90%.
Splenic vein cuff has been studied in one trial with no significant difference in patency rates. The use of a vein cuff has been suggested to increase primary anastomotic patency by improving hemodynamics, but this did not show up in any of the studies. Furthermore, the use of a vein cuff would reduce the amount of vein available for future revascularisations. When including a vein into the construction of a synthetic graft, a composite graft, the vein could later be replaced with a vein patch or cuff. However, the distal anastomosis is sometimes in a challenging position and it is therefore difficult to obtain a good seal at the vein-graft anastomosis. The introduction of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts has therefore been the preferred option in a recent American study. This study found no difference in primary patency (53% and 55%) or limb salvage (53% and 57%) of PTFE bypass grafts with and without the addition of vein cuff. The differences were however not significant. 
The use of distal vein cuff improved the outcome in previous studies and it is possible that the use of modern prosthetic material and improved surgical techniques have resulted in improved results.

In this scientific summary, I have synthesized the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to the potential benefits of acupuncture on stroke rehabilitation. These research articles are valuable sources of information about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for stroke patients. 
Study #1 explored the feasibility of combining conventional supportive treatment and acupuncture for acute stroke using a randomized controlled trial. It found that acupuncture treatment, applied in addition to conventional treatment, was associated with improved functional outcome in some patients. However, Study #2 found no significant differences in functional outcome between patients receiving acupuncture and those receiving conventional treatment alone, suggesting that acupuncture may have limited benefits for stroke rehabilitation. 
Study #3 investigated the effects of electroacupuncture treatment on stroke patients' ability to perform daily life activities and their quality of life. It failed to find any significant differences between patients receiving acupuncture treatment and those receiving no treatment. Similarly, Study #4 compared the effects of acupuncture treatment and standard poststroke motor rehabilitation and found no significant differences in outcomes between the 2 groups. 
In light of these conflicting findings, a larger study like Study #5 was conducted. It did not find any significant differences between patients receiving acupuncture treatment or sensory stimulation treatment and those receiving subliminal electrostimulation in terms of functional outcomes or quality of life. Therefore, the overall evidence suggests that acupuncture treatment may not offer significant benefits for stroke rehabilitation.
Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods may be needed to better understand the potential benefits of acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation. Future research should also focus on identifying specific acupuncture techniques or protocols that may be more effective for this patient population.
Overall, my scientific summary indicates that while there are some promising preliminary findings about the potential benefits of acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation, the available evidence is currently limited and requires further investigation. Future studies should be designed to rigorously test the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for this patient population."
8,"2 studies in this area have shown a decrease in negative symptoms, possibly due to lower plasma levels. However, one study did not show this effect. Negative symptoms are a complex set of characteristics that can be difficult to assess, and they may be related to other factors, such as social support or treatment engagement, in addition to plasma levels of antipsychotic medication.
Some newer studies have found that monitoring plasma levels of antipsychotic medication can help optimize treatment outcomes."

I am having trouble understanding the summary because the number of study abstracts is relatively large. I'm trying to connect the concepts from the abstracts to see how I can synthesize and summarize everything. I'm having difficulty synthesizing the large amount of information in the abstracts. I don't understand how to summarize the information. In addition, I am still having trouble understanding how to summarize research papers, which can be challenging because of the abstracts.

Sample answer:
-----------------
Influenza is a viral infection that can be caused by either type A or type B influenza viruses. It is commonly referred to as the flu. The influenza virus can be spread through respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Symptoms of influenza can range from mild to severe, and may include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. In severe cases, influenza can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, organ failure, and even death.  

One study examined the efficacy of early oseltamivir treatment in children with influenza (Study #2). The study found that while oseltamivir was effective in reducing the duration of illness in children with influenza A(H3N2) infection, there were no significant differences in the duration of illness between oseltamivir and no-treatment groups for children with influenza A(H1N1) or B infections. Another study evaluated the effectiveness of oseltamivir started within 24 hours of symptom onset in children 1-3 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the seasons of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 (Study #3).

Study #33: A prospective randomized study of postoperative suprapubic versus urethral catheter drainage after pelvic organ prolapse repair.
The aim of the present study was to compare the early use of suprapubic catheters with that of urethral catheters in patients undergoing either midurethral sling procedures or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repairs. The surgical outcomes were compared to determine whether the early catheter drainage could reduce the postoperative complications and hospital stay. The overall goal was to reduce the frequency of retention and the need for catheterization in patients undergoing POP repair. Between June 2013 and March 2014, a total of 80 women were randomly allocated to receive either suprapubic (n=40) or urethral (n=40) catheters. Of these patients, 54 (67.5%) underwent POP repairs and 26 (32.5%) had midurethral sling operations. The overall surgical success rate for POP repairs was 73.2% in the suprapubic group versus 87.2% in the urethral group (p=0.620), and 95.7% in each group. The number of patients with retention and the need for catheterization was the same with either suprapubic or urethral catheters. The median length of hospital stay and surgical success were not significantly different between the suprapubic and urethral groups. The length of time taken to remove the catheter was not influenced by the type of catheter. A significant correlation was noted between the vaginal wall thickness and the surgical success rate in the suprapubic group only. We conclude that the use of suprapubic catheters did not significantly reduce the rate of incontinence or retention in patients who underwent either POP repairs or"

Aims and Methods: We conducted a prospective, open-label randomised controlled trial. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of Methyl Prednisolone in mitigating post-cardiopulmonary bypass inflammatory responses as well as early postoperative outcome in selected patients undergoing cardiac surgery by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with or without hypothermic circulation arrest (CA).
                The subjects were randomly allocated to Group A and Group B; Group A received Methyl prednisolone intraoperatively and Group B received normal saline (NS) intraoperatively. The study variables were assessed at three time points: Baseline; immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induction; five minutes post induction of general anaesthesia (GA). The variables for analysis were inflammatory markers, serum lactate and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), haematological parameters, and clinical profiles. Clinical and demographic profiles were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Statistical significance was set at p <0.05.
The data are presented as means (SD). A 2‐way ANOVA was used to analyse the primary outcome variable between the study groups.
Results: Two‐way ANOVA showed that there was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory markers, haematological parameters, serum lactates and CK-MB between the groups at every time point.

16,"In the first study, salmeterol was compared directly against slow-release theophylline which requires titration to blood concentrations that have been associated with undesirable side-effects in the past. The data suggested that theophylline is best suited for the treatment of morning asthma, whereas 
salmeterol is probably more appropriate for the treatment of night time events such as cough and wheeze. 
In the second study, salmeterol demonstrated a greater efficacy and no significant side-effects as compared with inhaled cromolyn, a widely used therapy which is believed to be relatively free of side-effects. 
In the third study, salmeterol was compared against slow-release and oral theophylline which requires blood concentration monitoring. Although there were statistically and clinically significant side-effects associated with theophylline, it was still felt that theophylline was better than

19,"The goal of this study was to examine whether internal drainage stenting reduces pancreatic fistula compared to external drainage stenting. Both internal drainage stenting and external drainage stenting are considered safe for use in pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, there is no randomized controlled trial which shows the difference between external and internal drainage stenting. Thus, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 100 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer resection.
Methods: 
Patients who underwent minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer resection and who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy were randomly assigned to internal or external drainage stenting with a pediatric feeding tube. The patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms that are suggestive of pancreatic fistula. We compared the patients undergoing internal drainage stenting and the patients undergoing external drainage stenting with respect to postoperative pancreatic fistula, postoperative course, as well as other complications. If patients developed pancreatic fistula, they were categorized according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula.
Results: 
A significant difference in median postoperative hospital stay between patients who had internal drainage stenting and patients who received external drainage stenting was observed (21 days vs 24 days, P = .016). The incidence of pancreatic fistula was not different between internal and external drainage stenting, 20 and 26%, respectively (P = .360). Multivariate analysis showed that internal drainage stenting was not significantly associated with clinical benefits.
Conclusions: 
Both internal drainage stenting and external drainage stenting are considered a safe device for pancreaticojejunostomy. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of pancreatic fistula, postoperative course and other complications between the two groups. Internal drainage stenting might shorten postoperative hospital stay for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreaticojejunostomy, but this needs to be confirmed"
20,"17988543 in patients with diabetes is called Rosiglitazone Maleate and it is an anti-inflammatory drug.

Rosiglitazone acts as a thiazolidinedione (TZD), an agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-gamma)1 in the body, and has anti-inflammatory activity. (1) Rosiglitazone (Avandia) is used to improve blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise alone are not enough. It is also used with insulin to improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Rosiglitazone lowers blood sugar because it helps to make the body more sensitive to the effects of insulin. (1), (2) Rosiglitazone was approved by the FDA in June, 2000. (3), (4) The dose at which rosiglitazone is prescribed is 4 to 8 milligrams (mg) a day, taken by mouth. (5) The main side effect of Rosiglitazone is weight gain, so a weight management regimen is also important during treatment. (2), (5) The most serious side effects associated with Rosiglitazone are congestive heart failure and fluid retention. (2), (5) Heart failure may be life-threatening, so patients need to see their doctor for regular health checks. Other serious side effects of Rosiglitazone include stroke, chest pain, and bone fractures. (5)
Treatment options - The primary purpose of rosiglitazone treatment is to improve glycemic control by reducing blood glucose levels. (5) Blood glucose levels are often measured in the morning before eating breakfast (fasting blood glucose) and 2 hours after eating a meal (meal tolerance testing). (5) Other tests that may be ordered to evaluate the effectiveness of rosiglitazone treatment in lowering blood sugar levels include hemoglobin A1c and urine albumin to creatine ratio tests. Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of how much sugar is in the blood over the past three months. The urine albumin to creatine ratio test measures small amounts of proteins in a urine sample"

Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and carbon monoxide (CO) measurement using a micro-computer spirometer (MIR Spirolab), and self-reported COPD symptoms will be evaluated. 
A brief assessment of smoking habits will include an Fagerstrom test to assess cigarette addiction with a brief measure of nicotine dependence and an expectancy for nicotine effects. Each of these measures is usually administered in a 20- to 30-minute assessment session. 
In addition, participants will complete a computer-administered Stages of Change (SoC) Assessment, followed by a brief interview to determine which, if any, smoking cessation intervention might be selected to meet the participant's stage of change. Intervention strategies proposed by participants are matched with published intervention strategies in the appropriate participant stage of change, and an appropriate intervention is selected. 
Participants are randomized into one of four intervention groups:

23,"The findings of multiple studies suggest that stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine can be used to effectively treat symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients with comorbid tic disorder. Several studies have shown that these treatments can significantly reduce ADHD symptoms while also managing tic symptoms to a certain degree. However, there is also the potential for stimulants to exacerbate tic symptoms in some patients, which should be closely monitored during treatment. Despite the potential risks with stimulant use, the benefits in improving ADHD symptoms in patients with tic disorder are evident in multiple studies that included clinical trials with controlled designs. Guanfacine, a non-selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has also been shown to be effective in treating ADHD in children with comorbid tic disorder in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. This medication may have a lower risk of exacerbating tic symptoms, making it a potentially viable alternative for patients who are at higher risk for side effects with stimulants. Overall, the current evidence suggests that ADHD treatments such as MPH and atomoxetine can be beneficial in treating symptoms of ADHD while also managing tic symptoms in patients with comorbid tic disorder. While the potential risks should be closely monitored, the benefits in improving ADHD symptoms make these treatments a promising option for patients with tic disorder."

28,"Introduction. 
1. In recent years, families have become increasingly important partners in the care of schizophrenics (1-3). This is particularly true in developing countries, where most resources for patients are provided by families, and especially in Hong Kong where psychiatric services are scarce. Family-based interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects on patients' morbidity and course of illness (4-23), on the course of their psychotic symptoms (20,21), and even perhaps on the course of their neuroanatomical abnormalities as measured by MRI (22). However, the evidence that family interventions reduce rates of rehospitalization (16,17) is mixed. There appears to be a lack of consensus on the role that family interventions should play, and on whether they should be more in line with the traditional Chinese culture (24). Studies in Hong Kong suggest that patients who have a first episode of psychosis have more frequent relapses than patients with a chronic psychotic illness (25,26). This may be due to less adherence to medication during relapse prevention in those diagnosed more recently. The authors therefore suggest that a brief intervention consisting of both education and advice (EA), followed by supportive crisis management (SCM), is more appropriate for the care of patients at high risk of relapse. This is in contrast to the conventional approach used to treat psychotic patients in Hong Kong where there is currently no provision for EA and SCM. Furthermore, a brief intervention of this kind would also have cost-effective benefits. The authors therefore undertook a randomized controlled study in order (1) to assess the effect of a brief EA and SCM intervention on the outcome of the illness (rehospitalization rate); and (2) to explore the views of patients, relatives and health care professionals involved in the care of these patients.
2. This paper presents a report of the patients' clinical outcomes as measured by psychiatric assessment and hospitalization records, as well as in-depth exploration of the opinions of participants in the study. The study is based on clinical records and structured interviews with patients and relatives. Patient outcomes were also assessed by doctors blind to treatment allocation.

The first objective was to compare the effectiveness of diflunisal with that of aspirin and placebo during the first 24 hours following oral surgery. The second objective was to compare the incidence of dyspepsia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with diflunisal therapy with that of aspirin and placebo groups. A randomized, double-blind, three-treatment group, parallel study design was employed. A total of 106 adult outpatients undergoing third molar extractions received one of the three treatments 30 minutes before surgery. Patients made hourly entries on self-rating scales recording their pain intensity and pain relief during the first 24 hours post-operatively. Patient's pain intensity and pain relief were assessed at pre-assigned check in times from 0 to 24 hours. A total of 32 patients were discontinued during the study period due to withdrawal of consent, withdrawal due to other reasons or termination by the investigator. In addition, 45 patients were withdrawn from the trial, resulting in a total of 21 patients from the aspirin group, seven patients from the diflunisal group, and 15 patients from the placebo group not having a complete data set. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the self-rating pain relief scores was carried out on patients with complete pain relief data. The 12 hour time score revealed no significant drug differences. Likewise, there were no significant drug effects on pain intensity scores at intervals through the first 24 hours post-operatively as determined by analysis of covariance with adjustment for surgery type and entry score.."
31,"1. Background
The Canadian Vigabatrin Study Group is a team of investigators from ten Canadian hospitals that share a common clinical research interest. The group was formed to assess the safety and efficacy of add-on Vigabatrin therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy. Vigabatrin (L-beta,gamma-diaminoproionitrile, GVG, Gamma Vinyl GABA) is a novel anti-convulsant that, by selective irreversible inhibition of the metabolic enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T), is believed to amplify the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and consequently control seizures.
The investigators feel that Vigabatrin represents an intriguing alternative in the management of patients with epilepsy with complex partial seizures and/or partial seizures secondarily generalized. This antiepileptic drug has previously been shown to have a favourable risk/benefit ratio with no serious systemic toxicity. Based on the preliminary data from this study and the results of three recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the investigators are planning to file a New Drug Submission to Health Canada.
Epilepsy is a clinical condition that encompasses a range of neurological disorders characterized by unprovoked epileptic seizures. The current prevalence of epilepsy is approximately 0.3 to 3.0 percent of the general population, the greatest prevalence and incidence being among the very young and among the elderly. Epilepsy begins in young adulthood in approximately 70 percent of cases. Most patients with unprovoked epileptic seizures can be effectively treated and will eventually achieve seizure freedom. However, a subgroup of patients with epilepsy remains refractory to standard anti-epileptic drug therapy. Seizure frequency and duration are related to the severity of neurocognitive deficits. Treatment of patients with refractory epilepsy must focus on seizure control as well as an optimized quality of life for each individual patient..
Patients with recurrent epilepsy are at risk for other health conditions such as injury from falls, motor vehicle accidents, drowning, and hip fractures. Seizures also have a profound effect"
32,"Asthma management guidelines recommend that in patients who still have symptoms on treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids the first step should be an increase of inhaled corticosteroid dose, followed by the addition of long-acting inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists .  We found that the addition of salmeterol to low-dose beclomethasone dipropionate was superior to doubling the dose of beclomethasone dipropionate, in improving disease control in this group of patients..  This conclusion is based on the following outcomes over 6 months of follow-up (intention-to-treat analysis): mean morning peak expiratory flow, mean evening PEF, and the percentage of symptom-free days and days with asthma-related sleep loss or awakenings increased more in the Salmeterol group, as compared with no increase in patients receiving higher-dose beclomethasone.  Mean daytime and night-time symptoms decreased more in the Salmeterol group than in patients receiving higher-dose beclomethasone, while use of albuterol by patients receiving higher-dose beclomethasone remained unchanged.  Both treatments had a comparable safety profile. .

Study #27: Asthma control without increasing inhaled corticosteroid dose.. Asthma is generally managed with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as first-line therapy to control symptoms.  However, in patients in whom clinical control is not achieved with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy, it is unclear the most effective approach to achieve optimal disease control.  Guidelines on asthma management recommend that in patients whose asthma is not well controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids, the first step is an increase in inhaled corticosteroid dose, followed by the addition of long-acting inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists.   This study compared efficacy and safety in inadequately controlled patients receiving low-dose ICS therapy: either ICS alone or a combination of ICS plus a long-acting inhaled beta 2 agonist (salmeterol).  Salmeterol was added to the pre-existing low"
33,"Overall, the evidence suggests that subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a safe and effective treatment option for proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home has been shown to be as effective and safe as intravenous unfractionated heparin administered in the hospital, with the added benefit of allowing for earlier discharge and a reduction in hospital days. The key findings across these studies are as follows:

1. Reduced hospital days: Low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home has been shown to significantly reduce the duration of hospitalization, with some patients not needing to be hospitalized at all.

2. Reduced risk of major bleeding events: Low-molecular-weight heparin appears to have a lower risk of major bleeding events compared to intravenous unfractionated heparin administered in the hospital.

3. Equivalent or better efficacy: There is no significant difference in the efficacy of treating proximal deep vein thrombosis with low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home compared to intravenous unfractionated heparin administered in the hospital, with some studies reporting trend favoring the home treatment group.

4. Reduced cost: Treating proximal deep vein thrombosis with low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home has been shown to be more cost-effective compared to intravenous unfractionated heparin administered in the hospital.

5. Improved patient satisfaction: Patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home have been reported to have higher patient satisfaction compared to patients treated in the hospital.

Overall, the evidence suggests that low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home is a safe, effective, and cost-saving treatment option for proximal deep vein thrombosis, leading to improved patient experiences and reduced hospitalization for affected patients. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and could potentially lead to changes in clinical guidelines and policies related to the diagnosis and treatment of proximal deep vein thrombosis."
34,"There has been no previous study comparing treatment for all displaced fractures of the femoral neck. This study shows that in selected patients, the results of THR are far better than IF. Our results suggest that IF should be reserved for the treatment of non-displaced fractures of the femoral neck, or for use in cases where THR is considered unacceptable for some reason.

Study #17: [Internal fixation vs total hip arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. Prospective randomized study].. We prospectively studied 168 consecutive patients with displaced femoral neck fractures aged > or = 75 years. Patients were allocated to treatment by internal fixation or total hip arthroplasty. The rate of mortality within one year was 23.6% without any difference between the two treatment groups. After three years, the mean survival time of patients in the internal fixation group was significantly shorter than those in the total hip arthroplasty group. Survivors of the two treatment groups had a significantly better function and gait speed after one year. In the total hip arthroplasty group one patient underwent revision surgery one year after operation. No secondary operations were performed in the internal fixation group. Both methods can be offered as alternative treatment forms for a displaced femoral neck fracture in a mobile and mentally competent patient under the age of 75 years. The choice of procedure by the patient and the surgeon should be determined by the fact that one in four patients will die during the first year. If this is accepted, internal fixation is, however, associated with a 9 percent need for revision surgery, and this should be clearly explained to the patient before the operation..

36,"Methenamine hippurate is an effective treatment for cystitis in women. This is the first study to explore its utility in postmenopausal women. Of two hundred elderly women we randomly assigned one hundred to receive methenamine hippurate (Hiprex) and one hundred to receive matching placebo pills over a two year period. Side effects were common, but not serious, and were equally distributed between the two groups. The efficacy of Hiprex on the treatment and prevention of cystitis was judged by clinical and laboratory studies and by comparing treatment failures between the two groups, with treatment failure defined prospectively as two bacteriuria episodes during a given period. Of the 20 participants in whom a cure was anticipated, 15 relapsed within the first year and 13 within the second year. During the whole observation period we found the same risk for failure of treatment in both groups. These results do not support the use of Hiprex in cystitis in postmenopausal women..

Study #14: Effect of methenamine hippurate administration on the incidence of bacteriuria in ambulatory female patients with indwelling urinary catheter.. In a controlled double-blind study a single group of 59 patients received a daily antiseptic dose of 2.5 g methenamine hippurate as solution. Bacterial culture of the urine was performed at the end of the study after three to seven days of catheterization. The drug was efficient in reducing the incidence of bacteriuria. Of the 21 patients with sterile urine at the beginning of the study, after three to seven days of catheterization the urine was still sterile in 16 patients receiving methenamine hippurate solution and in 3 patients given only water. 
In the 38 patients who presented bacteriuria at the beginning of the study, only bacteriuria due to a variety of aerobic gram positive cocci responded to therapy. Bacteriuria caused by gram negative bacteria or anaerobic bacteria was not modified by the drug..

38,"The use of pre-emptive analgesics prior to dental treatment has gained significant momentum in recent years due to its ability to reduce or even eliminate post-operative pain. The concept is based on the notion that analgesics given before surgical procedures, either as short-term pre-operative doses or as long-term regimens, can blunt or completely eliminate nociceptive transmission via central sensitization mechanisms. By inhibiting the release of endogenous pain-promoting substances, such as prostaglandins, pre-emptive analgesia can help to minimize the magnitude of post-operative pain while also potentially reducing the need for opioid-based pain control medication.

One study suggested that the use of ibuprofen as a pre-emptive analgesic, prior to separator placement, can significantly reduce pain that is experienced 2 hours after separator placement and at bedtime. Preemptive ibuprofen therapy also exhibited lower pain scores at times 2 and 3 than did postoperative ibuprofen therapy administered at times 2, 3, and 7 days after placement. In a retrospective study, preemptive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were found to be predictable and effective in reducing postoperative pain.


Another study suggested that preoperative ibuprofen therapy can significantly reduce pain that is experienced 2 hours after separator placement and at bedtime. However, the use of postoperative ibuprofen therapy was found to be ineffective in reducing pain that was experienced before separator placement or after separator placement. In a clinical trial, preemptive administration of ibuprofen was shown to significantly decrease postextraction pain in children.


A study conducted on adult patients undergoing orthognathic surgery reported a decrease in acute postoperative pain following preemptive administration of ibuprofen and midazolam. The study found that the combination of midazolam, which is a sedative, and midazolam combined with ibuprofen resulted in superior pain scores.

39,"The key findings from the provided abstracts suggest that a combination of various therapies, including isokinetic exercises, ultrasound, and physical therapy agents such as hot packs or short-wave diathermy, can help in improving pain and functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The findings from the studies suggest that integrating these therapies can be more effective in managing the symptoms associated with knee OA than a single modality.
Ultrasound, in particular, seems to be an effective adjunct to isokinetic exercises in improving muscle strength and reducing pain and disability. However, it is crucial to note that the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy may vary based on factors such as dosage, duration, frequency, and application protocol.
Other aspects, such as individual patient characteristics, baseline function, and adherence to the treatment plan may also influence the overall outcome of therapy.
While the findings from these studies indicate that integrated therapy can provide beneficial effects in managing knee OA, further research is needed to validate these findings, determine the optimal combination of therapies, and evaluate the long-term effects of these interventions."

-----------------
Pilonidal disease is a common disease, mostly among young males. Although the conventional surgery, secondary repair of the wound after wide excision with or without curettage, is not technically difficult, it takes a long time, weeks or months, for a wound to heal. In this study, we compared the early postoperative results of the commonly used two surgical flap procedures in pilonidal disease: Karydakis and Limberg. The study was designed to compare the outcome of Open excision and secondary healing with rhomboid excision and Limberg flap in the management of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (SPD).

42,"Accordingly, the hypothesis of the present study is that the combined use of ultrasound and electromyographystimulation during block performance will shorten the time required to properly accomplish the sciatic nerve block, without changing the risk of vascular injury or perineural inflammation. The protocol of the study is as follows: Eligible patients will be randomized into 2 study groups by a central data collection software. After signing the informed consent, each participant will undergo the standard procedure prior to block performance. Once this stage is completed, ultrasound guidance will be used to visualize the popliteal fossa and to select the proper location of the 2 needles for sciatic nerve block insertion (Figs. 1A and 1B). Then, the tip of one needle will be placed in the vicinity of the tibial nerve, and the distal end of the other needle will be placed against the common peroneal nerve. The block will be performed using electro-myography stimulation by applying a low current (<0.3 mA), as previously described (Fig. 2). The needle position will be confirmed by observing the needle tip moving during contraction of the sciatic nerve and the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle under ultrasound examination. After confirming the correct needle position under ultrasound examination, and before performing the block, blood samples will be taken from each patient and sent to a central laboratory for the measurement of BMP-6 levels. Finally, patients will receive levobupivacaine and normal saline according to the randomized allocation (Fig. 3). Measurements of the BMP-6 level are expected to be completed within the first 4 h after the sciatic nerve block is performed. All the above mentioned interventions will be carried out by a single operator. The block onset time, block success rate during surgery, the time to recovery the motor block, and patient satisfaction will be recorded. In addition, each patient will be evaluated for postoperative pain (using a 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) ), the requirement for rescue analgesia, and the time to rescue analgesia. Adverse events will be recorded, and the data will be reviewed 2 times every week.

The first trial (N=262) showed that HIV-interventions that are gender-tailored and culturally congruent can lead to positive changes in STD knowledge, attitudes, and use.
The second trial (N=2157) showed there was a higher proportion of the control group had sex with a nonmain partner post-intervention compared with intervention participants. A higher proportion of the control group had a postintervention STI or UP (OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.01-1.98).
The third trial (N=542) showed that participants in the intervention group were more likely to report use of dual contraceptive methods during follow-up. However, there were no differences in the rates of incident STI or unintended pregnancy between the groups.
The fourth trial (N=400) showed the intervention group was 2.5 times more likely to have used a condom at last intercourse with their main partner than teens in the usual care group. These differences did not persist at 12-month follow-up.
The fifth trial showed that those assigned to the interactive video were significantly more likely to be abstinent in the first 3 months following initial exposure to the intervention, and experienced fewer condom failures in the following 3 months, compared to controls. A non-significant trend in data from a clinical PCR assay of Chlamydia trachomatis was consistent with that finding.
These results collectively support the statement: ""HIV-prevention interventions that are gender-tailored and culturally congruent can be used to improve contraceptive use, reduce unintended pregnancy rates, and reduce incident sexually transmitted infections...""
The overall evidence does not show an effect of the interventions on pregnancy prevention. Therefore, I believe there is insufficient evidence to support the following statement: ""HIV-prevention interventions can be used to reduce unintended pregnancy rates...“"

47,"Background
-----------------
While general practitioner care provides stable management of many patients with epilepsy, there are concerns about the adequacy of care, the level of continuing antiepileptic drug (AED) prescribing and the ability of patients to contact appropriate professional advice should they have problems or questions to ask. Some general practices provide a range of primary care based specialist services, and several studies have reported improvements in quality of care as measured by prescribing practices (1-3). However, very little information is available about the effects of primary care based specialist care on the opinions and perceptions of patients or on their attitudes towards the quality of care. Furthermore, the evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of these services is weak. Our study evaluated the effectiveness of a specialist epilepsy nursing service based in primary care in relation to the satisfaction and opinions of patients. We found significant improvements in communication between secondary and primary care, but no apparent effect on the number of hospital consultations, the amount of prescribing in the community or the quality of life of patients.
Intervention
-----------------
The study design involved matching groups of patients at random with a control group receiving ""usual"" care and an intervention group receiving a specialist epilepsy nursing and prescribing service. This intervention was based on a comprehensive epilepsy service developed by a UK hospital-based team and introduced in general practice as an ongoing collaboration between hospital and primary care-based clinicians (6,7). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this primary care based specialist epilepsy service.
Objective
-----------------
Evaluate the effects of a specialist epilepsy nurse service on the satisfaction and opinions of patients.
Study Design
-----------------
16 general practices, each with 1 specialist epilepsy nurse, served the local population. Patients with a doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy were invited to participate in the study by means of a letter from their general practitioner describing the aims and procedures of the study. Those who agreed to participate completed 2 research questionnaires at baseline, and the information from their medical records was entered into a computer database. The study doctor visited the practice and invited all eligible patients to make another appointment to see the epilepsy specialist nurse. All epilepsy patients attending the surgery for any reason were asked to complete 2 further questionnaires after either 1 year or 2 years from the original invitation. Pat"
48,"From these study abstracts, we can identify some important conclusions about the ways to approach and maximize breast cancer screening in low income family practice patients, which can be summarized informally by the following observations:

1. Patient reminders, in combination with provider reminders, can be effective in improving attendance rates at mammography screenings.

2. Educational materials targeting breast cancer awareness and the importance of regular screening can help to increase both knowledge and adherence among low-income patients.

3. The use of reminders from family physicians can be effective in increasing attendance rates for mammography screenings, and may be particularly beneficial for older women.

4. Patient-level interventions are often more effective than simply sending out invitations or reminders without any additional support or resources.

5. Different forms of outreach efforts may work better for different populations of low-income women, and understanding the needs and preferences of patients is essential for creating effective and targeted interventions.

6. The use of culturally-appropriate and language-appropriate materials is essential for ensuring that low-income patients have access to accurate information about breast cancer screening and are able to make informed decisions about their own health care.

7. The involvement of family physicians and practice staff in patient education and outreach efforts can help to build trust, increase adherence, and improve patient outcomes.

8. The use of grocery coupons or incentives may also play a role in increasing uptake for breast cancer screenings among low-income women, particularly those who are older and may be more susceptible to financial barriers.

9. A multifaceted approach that combines several different interventions and outreach strategies may provide a better chance of success than relying on a single intervention or approach.

10. The role of peer education and counseling, as well as the potential for peer support and networking, in promoting breast cancer screening among low-income patients is an important area for further research and exploration.

Overall, this summary suggests that a multifaceted approach that emphasizes patient education, provider support, personalized outreach efforts, and financial incentives may be the most effective way to improve breast cancer screening rates among low-income women. However, it's important to note that these conclusions are based on the results of several small-scale studies, and"
49,"In this clinical trial, early endoscopic intervention (EEI) was found to be less effective in reducing systemic and local inflammation in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis and biliopancreatic obstruction compared to early conservative management (ECM). Similarly, a 1998 prospective, multicenter study found that early ERCP and sphincterotomy did not benefit patients with acute biliary pancreatitis but no obstructive jaundice. However, the study also found that among patients with severe predicted attacks, ERCP +/- ES was associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays compared to conventional treatment.
Furthermore, a smaller prospective study suggested that early EI without fluoroscopy has the potential to be performed successfully by experienced endoscopists, with no mortalities observed in the EI group. Notably, the study did not compare the outcomes with conventional treatment, and only included severe cases of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Similarly, another study suggested that duodenoscopy in the treatment of severe acute gallstone pancreatitis was found to be feasible, effective and safe. However, more evidence is needed to determine the best treatment approach for patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis.
Overall, the study results indicate that early endoscopic intervention using ERCP does not currently provide clear benefits in the treatment of acute biliary pancreatitis, especially in patients with obstructive jaundice or severe predicted attacks. Therefore, early conservative management may be the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. However, larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and further evaluate the potential benefits of early EI for acute biliary pancreatitis."
50,"From the above research, we can conclude that oxytocin is a more effective drug in preventing postpartum hemorrhage. The study conducted in Abu Dhabi showed that oxytocin (10 units) alone was as effective as Syntometrine (1 ml) in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. The study conducted in Perth, Western Australia also showed that the use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure. Another study conducted in Hope Hospital, Salford showed that the duration of the 3rd stage of labor in each group was similar but there was less postpartum blood loss in the oxytocin plus ergometrine group reflected in the lower incidence of primary postpartum hemorrhage (> 500 mL). However, evidence from other trials shows that the ergometrine component not uncommonly has side effects of nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure.
All in all, the benefits of using oxytocin alone outweigh the side effects associated with the use of ergometrine plus oxytocin. This suggests that oxytocin should be the preferred drug for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage and should be incorporated as part of the active management of the third stage of labor."
51,"From the study findings, it seems that applying an eye patch following trauma (studies 6 and 7) or for corneal erosions (studies 8 and 9) does not provide any additional benefit over not applying an eye patch (studies 4 and 5). In studies 1 - 4, there was no significant difference in healing rates between the patched and non-patched groups. Similarly, studies 6 and 7 found that although pain scores were lower in the patched group initially, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of pain reduction over time. In contrast, studies 8 and 9 found that although pain scores were lower in the patched group initially, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of pain improvement over time. Additionally, study 9 found that applying an eye patch for corneal erosions caused more discomfort during walking and made it more difficult to maintain an upright posture, compared to those who did not have an eye patch applied. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that it is not necessary to apply an eye patch after trauma or for corneal erosions as the use of eye patches does not provide any additional benefit or reduction in pain and discomfort. 

Study #9: Effect of Eye Patching on Corneal Erosion in Nondiabetic Patients.. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of patching versus no patching on corneal epithelial healing after erosions in nondiabetic patients.
                The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of patching versus no patching on corneal epithelial healing after corneal erosions in nondiabetic patients. The study was conducted at a tertiary care institution, and all adult subjects were recruited who satisfied the inclusion criteria of the study. The exclusion criteria were: patients less than 18 years of age, patients with recurrent erosions, patients with a concurrent ocular pathology, patients with a corneal abrasion, patients with a foreign body in the eye, patients with eyelid pathology, patients with systemic disease, patients with severe burns, and pregnant patients.

52,"The review of the literature suggests that the use of preventive intervention, especially if these interventions is conducted with parents as well as offspring, is highly efficacious for preventing substance abuse. Moreover, the efficacy of these preventive interventions are also long-lasting. The implication of the efficacy of these parent-involved substance abuse prevention interventions for the development of policies as well as practice is obvious. At the same time, the results of the studies cited above should be given full consideration. These studies are generally methodologically strong.  However, there are some methodological limitations.  For example, some of these studies included samples recruited from specific communities.  The effect of these prevention interventions may not extend to other settings.  A general limitation of this type of research is that it is somewhat difficult to translate these findings into real-world practice because the conditions under which these studies were conducted would likely be very different from the conditions under which real-world practice is conducted.

53,"1) The purpose of this study was to observe the early and late effect of transcutaneous oxygen pressure in vascular patients with end-stage peripheral arterial occlusive disease(PAOD), on healing of diabetic foot ulcers by applying spinal cord stimulation (SCS).

2) This study was designed to test the hypothesis that initial TcPO2 helps predict clinical outcome in vascular patients treated with spinal cord stimulation. A randomized-controlled study with one year follow-up was made in 86 Fontaine stage IV patients with endstage peripheral arterial occlusive disease(PAOD) undergoing 21 day intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy for nonhealing ulcers.

3) There was significantly better total healing of foot ulcers in the SCS-group(69 vs 17%; p < 0.0001). Significantly more SCS-patients achieved an outcome of Fontaine stage II(40 vs 10%, p = 0.0014). There was temporary TcPO2 elevations in the SCS-patients. Foot TcPO2 increased significantly for the SCS-group (+213 vs -2%; p < 0.0001). However, the mean ABI at 12 months of the treated limb of the SCS-patients was not significantly different. SCS-patients had steady increases in TcPO2, and maintained them at 12 months.

4) The study was designed to test the hypothesis that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves limb salvage in patients with inoperable severe leg ischaemia. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) provided long-term pain relief but limb salvage at 18 months was not significantly improved by SCS in this rather small study

5) From November 1991 until May 1994 120 patients had been enrolled. Using life-table analysis, at one year 76% of these randomised patients were alive: 41% without amputation and 35% with amputation. Quality of life of the trial patients was low, even compared to other severely ill patient groups, such as liver and heart transplant candidates

Study Abstracts: 
Study #1: Reduction in the use of surgery for glue ear: did national guidelines have an impact?. It is widely accepted that the passive dissemination of national clinical guidance has little or no impact on practice.
                To assess the impact in England of an Effective Health Care bulletin on childhood surgery for glue ear issued in 1992 and to understand the reasons for any change (or lack of change) in practice that ensued.
                Time series analysis of the rate of use of surgery by children under 10 years of age from 1975 to 1997/8 in 13 English health districts.
                Following a rise in the rate of surgery in public (National Health Service) hospitals from 1975 to 1985, the rate declined by 1.6% a year from 1986 to 1992/3. Following publication of the guidelines in November 1992, the rate of decline increased to 10.1% a year. Even after allowing for a slight increase in the use of independent (private) hospitals between 1992/3 and 1997/8, the overall rate of decline was at least 7.9%. It appears that the rate of referral of cases by primary care physicians (general practitioners) halved during this period. Several contextual factors are thought to have contributed to the effect of the guidelines, including pre-existing professional concern about the value of surgery, the introduction of an internal market into the NHS, and growing apprehension among parents fuelled by scepticism in the mass media. During this unprecedented period of rapid change in clinical practice, staff delivering the service remained unaware of the alterations in their own practice.
                Passive dissemination of national guidelines can accelerate an existing trend in clinical practice if the context is hospitable. Policy makers should identify and target such situations..

58,"The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to examine the microflora of primary teeth treated by complete or partial removal of carious dentin. A larger number of microorganisms was detected in teeth submitted to partial caries removal before sealing, compared to the teeth treated with complete caries removal. However, after sealing the levels of colonization were similar in the two groups. The results suggest that persistence of bacteria does not seem to be a reason for reopening of cavities in deciduous teeth after partial caries removal.

Key Findings
-----------------
Overall, results suggest that 
o Most of the studies (studies 5, 6, and 7) demonstrated that alprazolam and midazolam were associated with greater impairment of psychomotor performance compared with a placebo
o Some of the studies (studies 2 and 6) demonstrated that alprazolam and midazolam premedication did not significantly prolong the discharge times of outpatient surgery patients
o Some of the studies (study 11) demonstrated that opioids were associated with lower incidence of intraoperative airway difficulties, lower pain experience at home, and greater incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting

Strengths
-----------------
Studies 5, 6, and 7 demonstrated that alprazolam and midazolam were associated with greater impairment of psychomotor performance compared with a placebo
Studies 2 and 6 demonstrated that alprazolam and midazolam premedication did not significantly prolong the discharge times of outpatient surgery patients
Studies 11 and 13 demonstrated that postoperative nausea and vomiting was higher in study groups that received midazolam premedication compared to postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients who did not receive a premedication; in most studies, there was no statistically significant difference in nausea or vomiting based on the use of premedication

Limitations

61,"Strontium ranelate is an agent that prevents bone loss and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It increases bone mineral density by increasing bone formation while reducing bone resorption.  Studies have shown that strontium ranelate is safe and well tolerated, with no reported serious adverse effects.  Strontium ranelate has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures by up to 50% compared to placebo.  It also increases bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck.  Strontium ranelate is a promising treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

62,"These studies showed that dopamine is more effective than dobutamine for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. The studies further indicated that dopamine is able to raise and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 30 mm Hg, whereas dobutamine failed to achieve MAP above 30 mm Hg in most infants. The findings suggest hat dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and the recommended initial dosage of dopamine is 5 micrograms/kg/min. 
While dopamine is the drug of choice to treat hypotension in preterm infants but dobutamine is also as efficacious and useful as dopamine and can be considered as an alternative in cases where dopamine fails to increase MAP above 30 mm Hg or causes unwanted side effects. In addition to MAP, left ventricular output (LVO) should also be monitored during infusion of dopamine or dobutamine because both drugs can increase LVO, which may lead to pulmonary edema.
This summary includes insights from all the studies, highlighting the importance of dopamine as the first-line drug for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and emphasizing that dobutamine can be considered as an alternative agent in cases where dopamine fails to increase MAP above 30 mm Hg."

Study #9: Beneficial effect of antenatal phenobarbital administration on intraventricular hemorrhage in premature newborns: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.. The purpose of this study was to determine whether antenatal administration of phenobarbital decreases intraventricular hemorrhage. Materials and Methods:
The study was a prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. The trial included 168 mothers at risk to deliver an infant less than or equal to 32.0 weeks of gestation. An investigational intravenous (IV) dose of 10 mg/kg of phenobarbital or 10 mL of sterile distilled water (placebo) was administered within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Treatment with phenobarbital started within 30 minutes of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and continued for an additional 4 days. Outcomes of interest include intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and perinatal mortality, and were identified according to accepted guidelines. Results:
One hundred twentysix mother–infant dyads completed the trial (80.7%). Intraventricular hemorrhage occurred in 17 of 86 infants in the placebo group and in only 2 of 80 infants in the phenobarbital group. The rate of intraventricular hemorrhage was significantly lower in the phenobarbital group than in the placebo group (P =.037). Phenobarbital had less effect on mortality. Periventricular leukomalacia, although rare in both groups, occurred in 5.9% of the infants of mothers in the placebo group and in 6.3% of the infants in the phenobarbital group. Conclusions: 
This study shows a beneficial effect of phenobarbital in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in premature neonates without increasing the risk of periventricular leukomalacia."

Study #1: Radical curative efficacy of five-day regimen of primaquine for treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria in India.. For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%.

68,"From the above study syntheses, the following is concluded.
-HANT wire produced lighter and more biologic forces than SE wire;
-Initial orthodontic pain is significantly reduced when using HANT orthodontic archwires;
-Pain response is subjective and not related to dental arch, crowding, sex, or social class;
-Although all wires produced improvements, there were no significant differences among wires;
-For severely crowding, the probability of crowding resolution duration was significantly different from slightly crowding;
-There was no statistical difference of the loading pattern of wires in laboratory and clinical conditions;
-Titanol arch wires failed to demonstrate a better performance than the cheaper multistrand stainless steel wires in this randomized clinical trial.

Study #9: A clinical trial of aligning archwires

Study #9: A clinical trial of aligning archwires. This is a clinical randomized control trial to test two archwires. Since there are two wires in this study, I can combine the findings of these two randomized clinical trials into one cohesive summary, as shown below:
When tooth movement was analyzed, the mean movement per contact point for Titanol was 1.7 mm and for Nitinol 1.42 mm. This difference was not statistically significant (P=0.05, t-test). A clinical impression was that the super-elastic archwire proved superior to the Nitinol, because it was more readily engaged into grossly displaced teeth. 
Summary:
-There were no significant differences among wires.

In summary, although all arch wires produced improvements, there were no statistically significant differences among wires. Titanol arch wires failed to demonstrate a better performance than the cheaper multistrand stainless steel wires in this randomized clinical trial. No differences in pain perception between the dental crowding and painful perception can be found in the three studies. These results suggest that there is no special correlation between dental crowding and pain perception before, during, and after tooth movement in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.

In the next study, the orthodontic effect of three different types of arch wire will be analyzed by using dental alginate impression and a stereo microscope to compare three frequently used orthodontic arch wires"

70,"Maternal and fetal outcome were excellent. The incidence of premature delivery, the incidence of fetal distress at delivery, and the number of infants admitted to the neonatal unit at birth were significantly (P less than .05) higher in the hydralazine group compared to the labetalol-treated group. However, cesarean rates were similar for the two groups (50 versus 55%). No perinatal deaths occurred, and perinatal morbidity was comparable in both groups.
The only significant difference between the two groups was the mean birth weight (8.2 gm lower in the labetalol-treated group). However, no complications related to this decrease in birth weight were observed.
Axillary temperature was significantly (P less than .05) lower in the labetalol group. No other clinical side-effects were noted in mothers or in infants. There was no evidence of any clinical effect of beta-adrenergic blockade at 24 hours of age. No clinical signs of adrenergic blockade were found at birth or at 24 hours of age. 


A comparative evaluation of metoprolol vs methyldopa (Plesset) in the treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension (P.I.H.) in Egypt..
Background:


There was a significant fall in diastolic BP of the group treated with methyldopa compared with the group treated with metoprolol. There were three perinatal deaths in the methyldopa group and one in the group treated with metoprolol.The mean birth weight of the babies in the methyldopa group was higher than that of the group treated with metoprolol.

Study #7: Improvement of endothelial function with a diet rich in alpha-linolenic acid after acute coronary syndromes: results from the OMEGA trial.. The aims of the present study were to assess 3-year clinical outcome, to examine the effects of a diet rich in alpha-linolenic acid (n-3 PUFA) on cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and endothelial function among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (TISTE MI) or high-risk non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with reduced left ventricular function (LVEF <40%). 
The OMEGA trial recruited 403 patients (46 +/- 13% females, mean age, 62.3 +/- 11.7) with TISTE MI or high-risk NSTEMI. They were randomly assigned to diet rich in n-3 PUFA (0.5 g/day) (n=202) or to diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (0.5 g/day) (n=201). The primary endpoint of the trial was the 3-year all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular morbidity events. Endothelial function (ET-1, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) was evaluated in 91 patients at baseline and after 18 months.
The trial did not show any difference in the primary endpoint between the groups. However, secondary endpoint analyses revealed significant reduction in non-cardiovascular death in the n-3 PUFA arm (P=0.02) (HR 2.4, CI"

Objective: The aim this study was to compare changes of basic haemodynamic parameters, which routinely fallows during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in condition of general (GA) and regional (RA) anesthesia. Material and Methods: After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, we randomized 50 patients scheduled for CEA (Tab. 1) in two groups (GA and RA). The examination performed in six control times: before induction of anesthesia (T1), 10 minutes after beginning of operation (T2), 5 minutes after cross clamping of arteria carotis (T3), 5 minutes after declamping arteria carotis (T4), 10 minutes (T5) and 2 hours after operation (T6). The results of study shows significant changes of blood pressure (BPs and BPm) and RPP index in T2 time in patinets undergoing GA. The changes occurred under influence of induction agent thiopental. These changes were in homeostatic range. In RA patinets, no haemodynamic changes registrated in control times. Therefore, from haemodynamic aspect RA was superior to GA..

75,"1) Based on the findings, fluoride varnish is effective in reducing the progression of caries lesions, and the most effective reduction was found in children with a moderate caries activity.
2) The results also support the use of fluoride varnish for those with a high caries risk, such as children with a high caries activity.
3) The results support the importance of a professionally supervised fluoride prophylaxis program in a population with a high caries risk.. In the absence of adequate and accessible fluoride prophylaxis programs, the use of fluoride varnish has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of caries lesions in children..

Study #9: [A 2-year comparison of sealant and fluoride varnish in dental enamel remineralization]..
Morton (1991) noted that remineralization studies used to compare different methods (e.g. sealants vs. fluoride varnishes) are difficult to standardize. He pointed out that remineralization rates are dependent on the rate of demineralization, which is inversely proportional to mineral content. Thus, differences in the demineralization phase may obscure possible differences in remineralization. The aim of this study was to compare the remineralization potential of sealants and Duraphat (fluoride varnish) on the occlusal surface of first permanent molars, which had been previously demineralized by an orthophosphoric acid solution for 10 seconds. A group of 50 subjects aged 9.4+/-4.1 were divided into two groups of 25. Group 1 had Duraphat applied twice a year, while Group 2 had the sealant applied twice a year. The subjects were recalled for reapplication at 6-month intervals and were monitored with bitewing radiographs.. The remineralization of demineralized enamel on the occlusal surface was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater with fluoride varnish than with sealants. Contrary to the assumptions underlying the study, the study showed that fluoride varnish was more effective than sealants in remineralizing previously demineralized enamel in young children."

77,"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin (vitamin) D is involved in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the diet through intestinal epithelial cells (11). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D is important for maintaining the integrity and strength of bone but is also essential for the maintenance of neuromuscular function, optimal blood sugar levels, and normal immune system function (12). The active metabolite, calcitriol, is synthesized from 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the most common circulating form of vitamin D, in response to the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (13) in the kidneys. Following ingestion, fat-soluble vitamin D is synthesized in the liver by cytochrome P450, family 27 subfamily B member 1 (CYP27B1) where it is then hydroxylated by P450scc (CYP2R1) to 25(OH)D, which is then further hydroxylated by CYP27B1 (13) to 1,25(OH)2D, which is an active metabolite of vitamin D. An alternative pathway of formation for 25(OH)D is through 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha hydroxylase (CYP27A1) (13). A previous study from the Perinatal Outcomes Study cohort (POSS) showed that vitamin D supplementation did not alter maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations or birth weight, length, or head circumference (14). Furthermore, maternal vitamin D deficiency was not associated with preterm birth (15). In another study in a separate cohort (POSS-II), which was conducted to assess maternal and cord blood concentrations of 25(OH)D at delivery and evaluate any associations between these variables and adverse perinatal outcomes (16), a majority of pregnant women had suboptimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations.

79,"In this study, the researchers explore the feasibility and safety of inducing modest hypothermia by a surface cooling method in awake patients with acute stroke. They find that hypothermia can be achieved in most patients using acetaminophen, and that hypothermia is not associated with any significant side effects. These results provide encouraging evidence that hypothermia may be a viable therapeutic option for stroke patients. Further studies are needed to determine if hypothermia can improve patient outcome."
80,"The use of the sliding screw should be considered in patients with a good general health when faced with an intertrochanteric fracture of the femur..

Background and Objectives:
-----------------
The treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur has largely been standardized. The use of the sliding screw as an implant is less controversial than the use of the Küntscher-Y nail. In this study the long-term results of using the two implants in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures are evaluated.

Materials and Methods:
-----------------
Patients with intertrochanteric fractures of the femur admitted to the Leeds General Infirmary between January 1985 and December 1989 were considered for inclusion. 107 patients were eligible for this study. 25 were excluded and not entered into the study: 18 could not have an external fixator applied, seven had been treated conservatively because of medical contraindication, and the management for one patient was unsatisfactory. The remaining 82 patients consisted of 63 women and 19 men, whose ages ranged from 60 to 104 years (mean 76, standard deviation 10.1 years). The incidence of fractures increased with age up to 75 years, when it reached a maximum of 53 fractures over a four year period. 28 patients were excluded before definitive fixation was performed. In patients 70 years and older, the incidence of intra-articular fracture and of non-union increased dramatically. In these two groups of patients the use of the external fixator was abandoned in favour of fixation with the sliding screw. 

Patients were excluded from the study only if: (1) they met all of the criteria for the exclusion of patients (the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons class of fracture is C 3, intra-articular fracture or any sign of infection), (2) they died within the first seven days from any cause, (3) they were unable to consent, or (4) they did not wish their condition to be included in the study.

Background
-----------------

Body fat is generally accepted as one of the components of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Although the majority of women have relatively lower body fat, women also tend to have more body fat distributed around abdomen and waist. This increased fat distribution in women, which is known to increase cardiovascular risk, may also be associated with a higher incidence of certain cancers including breast cancer. In a prospective study of 14024 women, age-adjusted rates of breast cancer were compared in women who were above age and fat percent criteria for being at increased heart disease risk (body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) of 0.85 or more) and their counterparts with a BMI below 25 kg/m(2) and WHR below 0.85 (1). In that study, the WHR of the breast mass and the WHR of the host tissue were found to be different in women with breast cancer, and breast cancer risk was not associated with adiposity measures in the host tissue. These results may also reflect the importance of adiposity distribution on the risks for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease.
Studies have also reported that insulin resistance (IR) is a risk factor for breast cancer (2). IR is associated with a number of markers such as age, obesity, lipoprotein metabolism and family history of diabetes mellitus. Of these, elevated waist circumference has been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of IR, with an even stronger correlation in Asian than Caucasian women (3). We have recently reported that serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were independently higher in women with increased waist circumference and higher estrogen and testosterone levels, suggesting the presence of IR and possibly also an increased risk of breast cancer in these women (4).
Many studies have reported metabolic abnormalities in abdominal obesity, including IR among postmenopausal women (5-9). Postmenopausal women with central obesity and/or"
86,"Study #1 provides a clear explanation for the lack of benefit of ASA and paracetamol in the context of menstrual blood loss in women with and without an IUD. This is because ASA does not act on platelet aggregation, and paracetamol does not have any effect on bleeding time or prostaglandin activity. 
Study #2 emphasizes the role of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors in reducing excessive menorrhagia, which is a common side effect of IUDs, particularly among women with an IUD. This is because prostaglandins are known to cause increased vascularity and vascular permeability, and their elevated levels may contribute to endometrial bleeding. Studies have shown that prostaglandin inhibitors, such as naproxen, significantly reduce menstrual bleeding, especially in women with an IUD using a Copper T device. 
This is due to the fact that prostaglandins are primarily synthesized in the endometrium of women with an IUD and can lead to increased vascularity and vascular permeability. Hence, prostaglandin inhibitors, such as naproxen, aid in reducing excessive menstrual bleeding. 
Study #3 highlights the importance of ibuprofen in reducing dysmenorrheic pain in women with IUDs. Ibuprofen is an NSAID that is known to reduce menstrual pain and cramps associated with menstruation. In women with an IUD, the increased levels of prostaglandins in the endometrium can lead to increased menstrual pain and cramps. 
Ibuprofen inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and thus reduces the symptoms associated with them. 
Combining the results of Studies #2 and #3, it can be concluded that anti-prostaglandin therapy such as naproxen/ibuprofen can be instrumental in reducing excessive menorrhagia and pain caused by an IUD in women. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of anti-prostaglandin therapy. 
Study #4 presents a clear explanation for the lack of efficacy of naproxen in reducing pain in women who undergo IUD insertion. It is due to the fact that prostaglandins play a"

Pregnant women remain a vital target for intervention. The authors tested a partner-assisted intervention for pregnant women and compared it to UC and WO components alone. Study results showed no additional intervention effects at any outcome measurement, although more partners in the PA condition were abstinent from smoking in late pregnancy than in the UC condition. In the authors’ view, it is time to refine the intervention approach tested to include more intensive and conjoint intervention, as well as to test for more favorable outcomes for pregnant partners who smoke. Additional studies of this type are essential."
91,"1. GTR and EMD are treatment modalities which show to predictably achieve gain in clinical attachment level when compared to conventional flap surgery. However, the present study found that the combined treatment of EMD and GTR, does not seem to improve the outcome of the regenerative procedure. 2. Access flap surgery is a costeffective alternative for periodontal regeneration where the defect is not very deep. 3. Guided tissue regeneration procedures with bioresorbable membranes result in greater clinical attachment gain and probing pocket depth reduction than conventional flap surgery. This may be true in both shallow and deep intrabony defects. 4. Guided tissue regeneration treatment modalities have been shown to result in periodontal regeneration. However, it is yet unknown whether the combination of EMD and GTR may additionally favor the regeneration process. 5. Bioesorbable membranes seem to be an appropriate treatment modality to treat infrabony periodontal defects. Thus, their use is probably justified by their ease of use, reliability, and predictability of final results. 6. A bio-resorbable type I collagen memorial was investigated as a barrier for guided tissue regeneration. The results of this study demonstrated that test lesions yielded significantly better healing than control sites over the 1-year period of the study.."

The results were similar when only pathologic subjects were included, and in female adolescents. One study found that single dose cefodizime and ciprofloxacin had similar efficacy and a faster clearance of symptoms than amoxicillin and ampicillin. There were no significant differences in bacteriologic response between the single and conventional dose groups, although the former had a significantly greater spontaneous resolution rate after a single dose. 2. In children, single dose amoxicillin is as effective as conventional doses and is equivalent to sulfisoxazole and fosfomycin trometamol. In adult females, a single dose of cefpodoxime is as effective as 10 days of ciprofloxacin and a single dose of cefixime may be more effective than two weeks of nitrofurantoin. 3. No statistically significant difference was found in cure rates between the treatment groups in most of the studies. However, the 3-day course showed greater spontaneous resolution rates than the 10 day course of amoxicillin, and had a better tolerance than 10-day course of trimethoprim."

94,"Study #1: The study showed that using EMLA cream as a topical anaesthetic for the repeated mechanical debridement of venous leg ulcers caused a significant decrease in the number of sessions required for a clean ulcer and reduced pain. The study's findings support the use of EMLA cream to enhance patient comfort during procedures that require debridement of leg ulcers.

Study #2: The study concluded that applying EMLA cream for about 30 minutes before scraping for ulcer debridement can significantly reduce the pain during debridement. This finding was supported by the visual analogue scale scores observed in both the patients and the treating physicians. The study also noted that there were no severe adverse effects associated with the use of EMLA cream. It is important to note that the study involved patients with arterial, venous, or arteriovenous leg ulcers and it is not clear if the results can be generalized to other types of wounds. 

Study #3: The study demonstrated that using a 5% topical lidocaine-prilocaine cream, EMLA, significantly reduced the pain of surgical cleansing of leg ulcers compared to placebo. The study found that EMLA offered an effective and safe way of pain management for patients during this procedure. The study also reported the plasma levels of the active ingredients, lidocaine and prilocaine, with no noted accumulation. However, it is important to consider that the study examined a limited number of patients, and its results may not be universally applicable. 

Study #4: The secondary analysis of the study showed that using an ibuprofen-releasing foam dressing consistently provided significantly greater pain relief than local best practice in all different wound aetiology subgroups, including those related to chronic and acute wounds. The study also found that there was no correlation between the initial pain intensity and the proportion of patients achieving a reduction in pain intensity of 50% or more on day five. These results suggest that the pain relief benefits offered by the ibuprofen foam dressing are effective for a variety of types of painful exuding wounds and do not appear to be affected by the initial pain intensity. However, it is important to note that the study did not examine the effectiveness of ibuprofen foam dressing relative to other treatments for wound pain management."

A recently published study suggests that while participants receiving a dual disorder case management intervention received significantly more health and human services than control group participants, there was no impact on recidivism. This article reports on the 2-year clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a comprehensive integrated treatment for jail recidivists with severe mental illness and substance abuse disorders.
METHODS: Fifty-four jail recidivists with severe mental illness and a substance use disorder were randomly assigned to service as usual (control group) or a high fidelity integrated dual disorders treatment (experimental group). Outcomes were tracked at 2-week intervals while they were incarcerated (3 to 19 weeks), at time of release from jail into the community (baseline), and 1 day prior to the subject's next re-arrest (7 to 24 months). An interim analysis was performed after 18 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: A reduction in jail days from baseline to study period was significant for both groups. The pre to post reduction for arrests and total convictions was significant in the experimental group but not the control group. During the study period, differences between experimental and control groups in arrests, convictions and jail days were not statistically significant. Experimental group attrition (dropouts) was relatively high.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental group was not effectively engaged in treatment. The high recidivism rate of the two groups in this study may be largely attributable to high levels of substance use (especially in the experimental group) during the follow-up period. Lack of engagement in treatment may be due to a number of factors, but high substance use and"
96,15-week thymosin α-1 (2-5 mg/kg BW/day) reconstituted thymic dependent immunity as measured by phytohemagglutinin responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy. Phytohemagglutinin responses improved in thymosin-treated patients but not in controls. Dose-dependency effects were observed for daily thymosin α-1 doses of greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg BW.

The effect size in the functional outcome was moderately large for the balance intervention, but negligible once the individuals withdrawn from the study were excluded from the analysis. The study authors conclude that both interventions significantly improve balance and mobility in community-dwelling, elderly patients with MCI.

Study #4: Exercise intervention in patients with MCI:

OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a six-month intervention training attention and executive functions (EFs) in community-dwelling patients with MCI, by modulating hippocampal function through aerobic exercise.METHODS: In the present study, 67 MCI subjects (46 females and 21 males, aged between 65 and 83 years) were studied. They were given specific aerobic exercises and were compared to a non-exercising group (non-exercising). All patients were followed up three times (at baseline, after three and six months).RESULTS: After six months, the exercise group improved on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog)(t96 = 2.50 p = 0.01) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)(t96 = 2.625, p = 0.009), compared to non-exercising control group.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that aerobic exercise may improve neuropsychological performance in patients with MCI."

Introduction
Over the years there has been concern about the increase in the proportion of men classified as overweight or obese. Between 1986 and 2008 rates of obesity (body mass index (BMI), ≥ 30 kg/m2) for men in Australia tripled from 13 to 39 % (AIHW ). Studies investigating strategies to promote weight loss and weight maintenance for men are lacking. Men who have participated in weight loss programs indicate they would find online programs appealing (Brodie et al. ), but the effectiveness of Internet-based weight loss programs delivered to men has not been examined. The aim of this study was to describe dietary changes in men participating in an obesity intervention as part of the Self-Help, Exercise and Diet using Information Technology (SHED-IT) study.
Methods
The SHED-IT study has been described in detail elsewhere (Dolan et al. ), and this report has been written in compliance with the CONSORT statement (Moher et al. ). Briefly, the SHED-IT (University of Newcastle) trial compared an 8-week Internet-based intervention v. information-only control to promote weight loss among overweight and obese university staff and students. Both groups received a brief individual meeting and a weight-loss booklet at the start"
99,"In summary, the evidence from the studies suggest that both besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension and chloramphenicol eye drops have comparable or higher efficacy for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis compared to placebo/vehicle. They also have a good safety profile. Given the limited number of studies and the heterogeneity of interventions, designs, and outcomes examined across the studies, the weight of the evidence indicates that further assessment would be helpful. Therefore, we suggest further research to address any uncertainties. 
Study Selection Flowchart: 
Characteristics of 10 Studies Included in the Review:
1. Nonsignificant difference between groups.
2. For binary outcomes such as ""proportion clinical success"", if the confidence interval (CI) of the control group was 0.5 or more, we considered the group size to be less than 30.
3. If the control group size was 30 or more, and the CI ranged between 0.5 and 2, we considered the group size to be 30 to 69.
Conclusions: 
The results of this review suggest that further research assessing the effectiveness and safety of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension compared to placebo in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis would be beneficial. The evidence suggests that there may be potential benefit in the use of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension compared to placebo in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, although additional research is needed to further assess the magnitude of this effect. Our findings also identify some areas of interest for future study. Further research could help to inform the development of more effective treatments for bacterial conjunctivitis, which could ultimately lead to better outcomes for patients."
100,"Simvastatin, a synthetic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, was used with interferon beta-1a for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. No beneficial effect of simvastatin could be noted. Although unlikely, we can not exclude that combination of other interferon beta-1a with other disease-modifying drugs still could be beneficial.

Study #5: A phase II clinical trial of a subgingival approach for reduction of disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
                Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a chronic, disabling, multifocal disease. The prevalence and incidence of the disease are increasing. 67% of the RRMS patients have high titers of antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). 
                To determine whether a reduction of Pg infection can reduce disease activity in RRMS patients. 
                A prospective, double-blind, randomized, 2-year, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the GUM Project (Group Ulceration and Multiple Sclerosis), was conducted to determine if non-surgical, subgingival periodontal therapy (PSG), alone or combined with treatment for RRMS with high titers of anti-Pg antibodies, could reduce disease activity in RRMS patients. 
                100 patients with RRMS and high titers of IgG to Pg were block randomized by MRI status to receive 30 sessions of placebo (4 ml of distilled water) or PSG (2 mg of chlorhexidine) to subgingival sites every 14 days ±1 day over a 4-month period, followed by a 3-month follow-up. The primary end point was an analysis of the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Secondary endpoints were quantification of lesions on MRI, brain volumes, cognitive functioning, physical and psychological well-being, systemic inflammatory markers, and antibody levels to Pg. 
                The ARR after 4 months of therapy was 0.10 in the Pg+PSG+group, 0.16"

Background
-----------------
Overview of the condition or problem
=================
This research is based on the findings that:

1. Smokeless tobacco (ST) causes significant morbidity and mortality, with increased risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes (Larsson 2002, 2004).

2. ST use has increased during the past three decades, while cigarette smoking prevalence has decreased (Larsson 2003; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997, 2001; Johnston 1999, 2001, 2002). 

3. Tobacco abstinence is associated with substantial improvements in health outcomes. For example, the mortality rate from all causes drops by approximately half for smokers within five years of stopping (Sampson & Rostis 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services 1994). This finding is consistent with epidemiological studies that show the most benefit accrues within 5 years of tobacco abstinence (Cornelius 2000; US Department of Health and Human Services 2004). 

4. Most previous research examining tobacco cessation has focused on cigarette smoking, with limited attention to ST use (Brown & Jarvik 1987; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1990, 1994, 1999, 1990, 2000, 2004).

5. Tobacco cessation among cigarette smokers who have never used ST has been consistently demonstrated to be greater than 50 percent at one year following treatment (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). However, this level of cessation is less than that produced by behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement for smokers who use ST (Lando & Fagerstrom 2004; Wetter et al. 2004). 

6. In this proposal, we define ""treatment outcome"" as biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence, i.e., absence of tobacco"

Abstract:
Glycemic control is associated with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CCII) delivers insulin as basal and bolus insulin. CCII use is growing in patients with T2DM. Therefore, the objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of CCII with the decompensated cardiovascular system in Korean patients with T2DM."

104,"The provided abstracts are related to a comparative study of various vacuum aspiration techniques for early pregnancy termination. Vacuum aspiration is a safe and effective method for abortions performed at less than 10 weeks of gestation. Manual and electric vacuum aspiration are both effective, but a larger percentage of women were bothered by noise in the electric group. Manual vacuum aspiration was more acceptable than electric vacuum aspiration for elective abortions performed at less than 10 weeks gestation. Women's acceptability of and experiences with manual vacuum aspiration were similar to those with electric vacuum aspiration for first trimester abortion, with some differences observed in participants' ratings of the importance of method characteristics and in their perceptions of their abortion methods after their abortions. Vacuum aspiration techniques were compared for performing first trimester abortion, and it was observed that half of the participants in each group were 6 to 10 weeks' gestation and half were 11 to 12 week's gestation. Time from insertion to removal of the speculum was significantly less with VA than D & C at 6 to 10 weeks' gestation but not at 11 to 12 weeks' gestation. Since vacuum aspiration is at least as safe as D & C, and appears to be more convenient and costeffective, it should on the basis of this experience be accepted over D & C as the standard method for treatment of first trimester abortion. In a study comparing pain perception and procedure time with two first-trimester abortion techniques performed by residents and faculty, we found that procedure time for the manual vacuum aspirator is greater than that for the electric vacuum curettage..
There was no significant difference in frequency of complete abortion, but MVA and VA operations were equally effective in clearing the uterine cavity and had similar complication rates..
The provided abstracts demonstrate that various vacuum aspiration techniques are effective and safe for first trimester abortion, except for higher noise levels with electricity. Patients overall experienced similar levels of pain and perceived similar abortion methods after their abortions. The level of pain after aspiration did not vary significantly in patients who had abortions performed by residents or faculty..
Overall, the provided abstracts suggest that vacuum aspiration is an effective and safe method for early pregnancy termination, with similar levels of pain and similar abortion methods experienced by patients in both manual and electric vacuum asp"
105,"Background: In 2014, an estimated 17 million people were victims of domestic violence in the United States (1). In 2019, the number of victims was higher, at 19 million—an all-time high, according to the report (1). This trend has only increased since the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases of intimate partner violence (IPV) increasing by 50% in some places (2). The effects of IPV on pregnant women and their children are significant and long-lasting (3), making it critical that preconception and prenatal care and providers assess for and respond to IPV. It is important to provide IPV survivors with interventions that meet their safety and health needs to reduce stress levels, protect children from witnessing violence, and improve birth outcomes. We have found that it is even more important for clinicians and educators to understand the needs of the community (in this example, pregnant women) they are trying to help, given the diversity of the population we serve. These patients may need help with housing, food insecurity, transportation, education, employment, legal issues, and community resources. Many women who have experienced IPV do not see violence as a serious health issue, so identifying the need to access help and resources is a key part of the case manager role. To ensure sustainability in serving our community members (pregnant women), interventions developed for this population need to take into consideration the needs of the people we serve and the resources available to support them.

Our objectives are to increase knowledge about IPV and violence-free pregnancy through the following activities.
1. Training health care providers and prenatal clinic staff, community health workers, social workers, and others on how to support patients, including pregnant women, who have experienced violence in the home.
2. Implementing protocols and workflows for identifying patients requiring services related to IPV and other social determinants of health.
3. Creating connections and referrals to community resources that will support patients in achieving goals such as financial independence, education and job training, and health care appointments.

We will provide knowledge from the following organizations:
•The National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, the leading organization on violence intervention and treatment
•Family Justice Centers of Los Angeles, which focus on protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault
•University of California, Los Angeles’"

109,"The effectiveness of day hospital care in acutely ill psychiatric patients is uncertain. Previous studies were often conducted in single locations with small samples of participants and were thus susceptible to bias.
To address this limitation, we conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine whether day hospital care is as effective as conventional inpatient care with respect to symptomatology, social functioning, treatment satisfaction, and subjective quality of life.
We found that day hospital care was similar in effectiveness to conventional inpatient care on the measures of symptomatology, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. Patients in the day care group experienced more positive effects on measures of social functioning at discharge and after 3 and 12 months. Hence, acute day hospital care can be recommended as an alternative for voluntarily admitted acutely ill psychiatric patients.

                                  123 patients admitted for inpatient treatment but found suitable for randomization to day hospital or inpatient department care. 39 (32%) of the patients had schizophrenia.
                                  Day hospital services combined conventional psychoanalytic day treatment (5 days a week) with an ambulant service available out of hours. Patients were treated with a combination of group or individual psychotherapy, supportive counseling, and pharmacotherapy. Inpatient treatment depended on the hospital in which patients were admitted.

Patients aged 23.3 ± 9.4 years with cystic fibrosis (CF) treated with placebo showed a 15.2 percent decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) from weeks 0 to 24, whereas inhaled tobramycin increased FEV(1) by 9.7 percent from baseline to week 20 (P < 0.001). Patients treated with inhaled tobramycin had a 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2 to 43 percent) reduction in the risk of hospitalization compared with patients treated with placebo. Inhaled tobramycin was not associated with nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. Patients who received inhaled tobramycin had a decrease in the density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum of 0.8 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) per gram from baseline to the final week of treatment. Inhaled tobramycin was not associated with accumulation of tobramycin in serum or with a detectable increase in levels of creatinine or aminoglycoside antibiotics metabolized in the bile (i.e., gentamicin and amikacin). The proportion of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates that had a tobramycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of at least 8.0 micrograms per milliliter increased from 25 percent to 32 percent in patients treated with inhaled tobramycin compared with a decrease from 20 percent to 17 percent in patients treated with placebo.

Abstract of Study #1:
Background: Chronic pelvic pain is one of the most common conditions in chronic pain disorders. Written emotional disclosure is a common intervention used in stress management programs for people with poor mental health, including people with chronic pain. However, this intervention has limited effects for health-related outcomes. The moderator literature is one approach for understanding why writing about stressful experiences is less effective among people with poor medical, psychological, and social health. Therefore, the current study aims to examine whether individual difference variables moderate the effects of a popular stress management coping technique, emotional disclosure, on pain and other related health outcomes, among chronically affected women.

115,"The above 15 studies in infants </= 2000g (LBW) support the practice of kangaroo mother-care (KMC) or holding/skin-to-skin care of stable preterms (>/= 32 weeks gestation, Birth Weight > 1500g) babies by their mothers. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement, the ideal location for skin-to-skin care of the stable preterm infant is near the mother's breast. The AAP policy statement states that in addition to the obvious maternal and infant health benefits of KMC, this practice has a profound impact on breastfeeding success and exclusive breastfeeding rates in stable preterm infants. Holding a baby skin-to-skin increases the secretion of maternal oxytocin, the hormone that helps the body contract during labor. In KMC, the mother's oxytocin levels rise. This results in a greater let-down of milk for breastfed babies, as well as higher prolactin levels. Prolactin is the hormone that stimulates breastmilk production and secretion. In addition, as a result of her close proximity to her infant, the mother is able to more easily interpret the baby's cues, which is essential to successful breastfeeding. KMC may help the mother's body adjust to her new role as a lactating mother by enhancing oxytocin levels and milk production. Furthermore, KMC is cost effective, enhances the sense of security and attachment, and improves parental competence. The above review of studies have shown that KMC benefits both mother and infant. However, there are some important differences between infants and mothers in developed countries compared to those in developing countries. The results of studies in developing countries are promising; however, a definitive conclusion that kangaroo mother care is an effective intervention for the health and development of the infants and mothers cannot be reached until more studies in developed countries are included in systematic reviews."

Study #1: Comparison of four different treatment regimes in hirsutism related to polycystic ovary syndrome.


Study Purpose:: The study was originally designed to compare the efficacy of four different treatment modalities: low-dose (2 mg) cyproterone acetate once daily during the first 10 days of the 21-day cycle associated or not with an oral contraceptive (OC) containing an antiminoglobulin hormone, spironolactone (50 mg/day), or an OC alone. A total of 141 women were followed for 6 months. However, in an attempt to increase acceptance to the study and prevent dropouts, the participants were randomly assigned to four different groups (n = 36 each) during the second study period. Group 1 (n = 48): received a low-dose, combined OC. Group 2 (n = 65): received cyproterone acetate at a dose of 100 mg/day for the first 10 days of the 21-day cycle along with an OC containing 2 mg cyproterone acetate. Group 3 (n = 12): received spironolactone 100 mg/day. Group 4 (n = 16): received ketoconazole 400 mg/day. All patients were followed during the study. At the end of 6 months, the treatment for each group was considered the best if the decrease in the hirsutism score reached or exceeded 30% (P < 0.05). A total of 39 patients completed their respective treatments (group 1, n = 12; group 2, n = 16; group 3, n = 10; and group 4, n = 1). The decrease in the hirsutism score after 6 months of therapy was greatest in group 4 (34.6%) compared with groups 1, 2, and 3 (20.1, 18.1, and 12.8%, respectively)."
117,"30-day mortality rate associated with selegiline treatment in Parkinson patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease . The survival risk 30 days after discontinuing of any treatment group was estimated. In total, 52 deaths were reported during the 30-day follow-up . In addition 16 subjects died from unrelated causes . The majority (37 deaths) of deaths occurred in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for the cumulative incidence of death at 30 days after discontinuation of selegiline or placebo treatment were 0.015 and 0.021, respectively (P=0.69). The 30 days mortality rate for the group receiving selegiline treatment was 0.34% per year (130 total observation years) and 0.67% (59 total observation years) for the placebo group, which results in an approximate hazard risk estimate of 1.97 (95% CI, 0.51-8.21, P=0.35). All deaths that occurred within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment were reviewed. Eight deaths were confirmed to be Parkinson-related. These numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions from. The mortality rate following discontinuation of treatment was highest after discontinuation of treatment in the selegiline/levodopa patient’s group, which is most likely due to small numbers and random chance.
The long-term safety of selegiline-treated Parkinson patients is demonstrated within the first year of the study (28, 30, 32). In this study an increase in mortality was not seen. In comparison with placebo-treated subjects, selegiline-treated subjects had a significantly higher drop-out rate due to adverse events . This is in accordance with earlier reports . In a 5 year-study on 157 patients, selegiline treatment significantly delayed the initiation of levodopa therapy and decreased total and motor UPDRS scores with ∼10% compared to placebo. This is consistent with results from a 7-year follow-up of 54 PD patients . In the long-term follow-up of the above mentioned 54 PD patients"

119,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a medical intervention for victims of sudden collapse and cardiac arrest. The goals of CPR are to ensure the blood continues to receive oxygen (ventilation) and to maintain the heart's pumping action (circulation). Currently, the most common method of CPR is to use the hands to press down (compress) on the sternum (breastbone), a place found in the center of the chest located right above the heart.
The active compression-decompression (ACD) method of CPR combines chest compressions with positive airway pressure delivered through either a device called a bag-mask or a device called a suction-decompression resuscitator (SDR). The SDR delivers a series of suctions and pressures for each compression. The ACD method was initially thought to be better able to move blood around the body, however, additional studies have not found ACD to be more effective than standard CPR methods. One potential reason for this finding is differences in the timing of CPR intervention. The effect of timing on survival after cardiac arrest has not been clearly established.
The goal of this systematic review was to examine clinical studies comparing the effectiveness of ACD CPR to standard CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. We looked only at studies that specifically compared the timing of CPR intervention to determine how this timing differs between using ACD CPR versus standard CPR.
We also compared the effectiveness of ACD CPR to standard CPR in order to gain a better understanding of how this new method of CPR impacts survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. It is important to note that many of the studies examining ACD CPR were conducted by physicians who have in-depth medical education and understanding of resuscitation; therefore, the results of these clinical studies are likely to be more robust than what may have been found using a lay-person's level of understanding.
This systematic review revealed that there are no clinical studies examining how differences in the timing of CPR intervention impact survival after cardiac arrest. However, the results of the clinical studies included in this systematic review examined the effectiveness of the ACD CPR method to standard CPR and found no consistent evidence that the ACD CPR intervention produced any increased risk or adverse effects when compared to standard CPR. These findings should be seen as preliminary"

Research Question: The specific research question being addressed is:
How effective are foot orthoses in improving pain and function in individuals with plantar fasciitis, bunions, hallux valgus, and rheumatoid arthritis? 
Study #1: This study found that custom foot orthoses were more effective than a sham control in reducing foot pain and improving function in individuals with a cavus foot type. The study suggests that custom foot orthoses can be an effective treatment option for individuals with a cavus foot type experiencing pain and functional limitations. 
Study #2: This study found that foot orthoses provided no benefit in managing foot pain or disability in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The study concludes that foot orthoses should not be used as routine treatment for managing foot pain and disability in this population. 
Study #3: This study found that surgery was more effective than orthosis and a control group in reducing foot pain and disability in individuals with hallux valgus. The study suggests that surgery may be a more effective treatment option for individuals with hallux valgus experiencing pain and functional limitations. 
Study #4: This study found that custom-made orthoses were more effective than over-the-counter arch supports and tension night splints in reducing first-step pain and pain felt during the day in individuals with plantar fasciitis. The study suggests that custom-made orthoses may be a better choice for individuals with plantar fasciitis experiencing pain and functional limitations. 
Study #5: This study found that foot orthoses provided no benefit in managing foot pain or disability in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to a control group. The study concludes that foot orthoses should not be used as routine treatment for managing foot pain and disability in this population. 
Study #6: This study found that both foot orthoses and night splints were effective in reducing pain from plantar fasciitis. The study suggests that both foot orthoses and night splints may be effective treatment options for individuals with plantar fasciitis experiencing pain and"
121,"The studies above have collectively demonstrated that a multifaceted program known as active management of labor can shorten the length of labor and decrease the rate of cesarean section in nulliparous patients. However, findings vary between studies, and the effect of active management of labor on caesarian section rates is inconclusive.
Study #1 focused on the impact of active management of labor on caesarean section rates, and it revealed that women undergoing active management of labor were less likely to require a cesarean delivery than those who were in the traditional care group. The study was conducted in 1988, and there was an overall decrease in the cesarean section rate in the control group. This could potentially explain the difference observed between the two groups.
Study #2 investigated the effects of early amniotomy and oxytocin administration on labor outcomes. The study found that active management of labor did not reduce the overall cesarean section rate but did significantly shorten the first stage of labor. The study also found that there was no difference in the rate of infection or postpartum hemorrhage between the two groups.
Study #3 focused on the impact of active management of labor on labor outcomes and cesarean delivery rates in a Nigerian district hospital setting. The study found that active management of labor significantly reduced the cesarean section rate compared to traditional care. The study also found that there was no difference in maternal infectious morbidity, uterine hyperstimulation syndromes, ruptured uterus, or neonatal Apgar scores between the two groups.
Study #4 aimed to determine the effects of an active management of labor program on the rate of cesarean section and labor outcomes in low-risk nulliparous pregnant women. The study found that active management of labor shortened the first stage and duration of labor compared to traditional care. However, there was no significant difference in the cesarean delivery rate.
Study #5 was a randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis that aimed to determine whether active management of labor reduces the rate of cesarean section and prolonged labor without influencing maternal satisfaction. The study found that active management of labor did not reduce the rate of cesarean section but did shorten the length of the first stage of labor. The study also found that there was no difference in maternal satisfaction between the two"
122,"These studies suggest that rhLH can induce oocyte maturation and oocyte retrieval equally effectively as u-hCG during IVF and is better tolerated for injectable doses up to 30,000 IU. Further studies may be needed to determine the ideal dose of rhLH in IVF or ICSI cycles. Overall, it appears that rhLH is a suitable alternative to hCG for inducing final follicular maturation and oocyte retrieval in IVF/ICSI cycles with comparable outcomes and safety profile. .

127,"Study #5: Tracheotomy versus no tracheotomy--a prospective, randomized, controlled study.. Tracheotomies (throat tube insertion via neck) are an age-old and frequently performed procedure in critically ill patients. These patients are usually ventilated with the aid of an orotracheal tube. The use of a tracheotomy greatly reduces the chances of a ventilator-induced accident and facilitates mouth care. However, there may be a rise in bacterial infection in the tracheotomy scar, affecting the patient's recovery.
                This study aims to compare the outcome and complications of patients undergoing neck tube insertion and those without tube insertion.
                This prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care, teaching hospital in India from August 2019 to March 2021. Patients with severe head and facial injuries requiring maximum 14 days of ventilator support were randomized into two groups: patients undergoing tracheotomy (neck tube insertion) at a predetermined time of 7 days after intubation (neck tube group) and patients continued onto orotracheal ventilation (control group) until ventilator support was no longer required.
                There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of baseline demographic characteristics, clinical variables, or outcomes. The mortality rate was similar between the groups with no significant difference in terms of post-ventilation care complications.
                This study suggests that neck tubes are not necessary unless specifically indicated due to potential complications. Therefore, in critical care settings, a conservative approach should be considered and neck tubes should be avoided unless they provide benefits to the patient that outweigh the potential complications.

128,"93 patients (50 with Major Depression and 43 with Dysthymic Disorder) were enrolled in a 6-week double-blind randomized comparison of imipramine hydrochloride and phenelzine sulfate. For patients with a DSM-III-diagnosed Major Depression with Melancholia, no differences could be found between imipramine and phenelzine. For patients with Dysthymic Disorder, phenelzine was found to be superior to imipramine. This study does not support the superiority of phenelzine over imipramine in the treatment of a DSM-III-defined Major Depression with Melancholia, but does support phenelzine as an effective treatment modality for Dysthymic Disorder."
129,"Study #1: Summary of findings: The study aimed to compare the effects of three different iodine interventions on school children in an area of moderate to severe iodine deficiency. The three iodine interventions included the consumption of iodized salt, iodized oil capsules, and provision of iodized salt by researchers. The salt iodine content was measured bi-monthly for 18 months and indicators of iodine status, including thyroid volume and goitre by palpation, were assessed. The results showed that group A (iodized salt by researchers) had significantly lower thyroid volumes and goitre prevalence compared to group B and C (iodized salt purchased from the market and iodized oil capsules, respectively). However, urinary iodine levels were observed to be sufficient in all groups by 18 months, suggesting that moderate to severe iodine deficiency was successfully addressed. It is concluded that providing school children with iodized salt, either obtained from researchers or purchased from the market, is a viable and effective strategy for reducing the prevalence of goitre. 

Study #2: Summary of findings: The study aimed to investigate the effects of voluntary intake of iodinated salt on prevalence of goitre in children living in an area of iodine deficiency. The study was performed on a cohort of 334 children aged 10 years, who were randomly assigned to two groups: group A (iodized salt) and group B (non-iodized salt). The findings showed that goitre prevalence, as assessed by palpation, significantly decreased in group A over the 4-year study period. Iodine excretion in the urine also significantly increased in group A. Overall, the study concluded that voluntary intake of iodized salt can effectively reduce goitre prevalence and improve iodine status in children living in iodine-deficient areas. 

Study #3: Summary of findings: The study aimed to assess the effects of iodoprophylaxis on thyroid size during pregnancy in women living in an area of moderate iodine deficiency. The study enrolled 35 pregnant women and randomized them into two groups: group A (iodized salt) and group B (control group). Thyroid-stimulating"

Safety: Salmeterol did not increase sIL-2R, ECP or tryptase.
Science: Patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids treated with salmeterol may have better control of their asthma, possibly attributable to better bronchodilation and/or less airway hyper-responsiveness.

Abstract:
Salmeterol (SAL) is a highly selective beta(2)‐agonist under investigation as a sustained bronchodilator. This randomised, double‐blind, crossover study of 20 asthmatic patients assessed the efficacy of regular SAL treatment and its influences on systemic markers of inflammation. After a 2‐week run‐in, patients received either 50 microg b.i.d. SAL or 400 microg q.i.d. albuterol on inhalation powder for 2 weeks in random order, separated by a 2‐week washout period. There were no differences with respect to demographic or baseline characteristics or response to 2 weeks of regular treatment with 500 microg b.i.d. salbutamol as reference. Compared with that provided by albuterol, SAL treatment significantly improved lung function and patient's assessment of asthma control. Compared with albuterol, SAL was associated with lower serum concentrations of sIL‐2R during regular treatment. No differences were seen in serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein or tryptase between the two treatment periods (sensitivity analyses revealed that a longer treatment period with S"

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in rural areas of China with approximately 20% of the general population having 30-yr risks of CVDs of >/=20%. In 2011 China issued the Guidelines on Dietary Management of Residents with CVDs, advocating increasing intakes of fruit and vegetables (F&Vs) to 500 g/day for the general population. However, low socioeconomic status (SES), low education level and limited access to F&Vs may create barriers to increasing F&V intake in rural China. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop low-cost, innovative health promotion interventions to address the issue of insufficient F&V intake. Moreover, in order to effectively design and implement interventions, it is important to identify the local characteristics that may determine whether the intended outcomes are actually achieved in practice. Research on the effectiveness of rural interventions in China mainly focuses on the promotion of general health or cancer prevention. However, few studies have been conducted on the effect of community-wide interventions on improving F&V intake in rural China. Therefore, this randomized controlled community intervention trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effect of a F&V intervention on increasing F&V intake, reducing cardiovascular risk factors and improving community diet. A detailed description of the study design for the trial is provided in the published protocol.1

Hypothesis
-----------------
During the 3 years intervention period,  the dietary patterns, health knowledge, and cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. cholesterol, blood pressure, and adiposity) of adults will increase in intervention (I) communities but not in control (C) communities, as compared with baseline. In addition, participants in I communities will have greater improvements in dietary patterns, and greater reductions in health risk factors than participants in C communities. We assume that these effects will be influenced by household socioeconomic characteristics, household food security/insecurity, and residents’ perceived community social support.

140,"In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence from the various studies to conclude that colonoscopy is effective in detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) and reducing colorectal cancer mortality. Study #1 and Study #2 both provide evidence that biennial screening is effective in reducing CRC mortality. Study #3 and Study #4 support these findings. The combination of these studies strongly suggests that regular screening can significantly reduce CRC-related mortality. 
Both Study #1 and Study #2 demonstrate that colonoscopy is well-tolerated and generally safe. There were no reported complications or death in these studies. Study #3 and Study #4 do not directly address this issue, but the overall safety of colonoscopy is well established. 
Colonoscopy remains the gold standard for CRC screening since it provides a direct view of the colon. 
Study #5 highlights the potential risks of CRC screening, including invasive procedures and side effects such as sedation or complications. However, it also highlights the possibility of false negatives with screening tests, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and worse outcomes. 

Study #6 and Study #7 provide additional evidence that screening with colonoscopy can improve survival for patients with CRC. 
Overall, the results of these studies indicate that colonoscopy is effective in detecting CRC, reducing CRC mortality, and improving survival outcomes for patients with CRC. However, it is important to note that colonoscopy may not be suitable for all patients and may have associated risks that need to be considered. Therefore, personalized treatment plans should be developed for each patient to ensure optimal outcomes."
141,"Introduction:
Labor is a painful experience for the majority of pregnant women and most of them wish to use pain relief techniques during delivery. In the past few years, continuous epidural analgesia was the main mode of pain relief during labor [1]. Recently, a combination of subarachnoid blockade using pethidine and local anesthetic followed by continuous epidural analgesia has been used as an alternative approach to provide analgesia for laboring patients [2]. This combination is called combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia. The reported advantages of CSE over continuous epidural analgesia are: faster onset of analgesia, with a shorter duration of sensory blockade, need for less local anesthetic, more patient satisfaction, and a lower incidence of motor blockade at delivery[3, 4]. There is no agreement among physicians as to which option is better because of reported variations in the maternal/neonatal side-effects profile of each method in several studies [1-8]. In this study, we assessed the analgesic efficacy and incidence of maternal, fetal and neonatal side-effects of combined spinal epidural (CSE) and epidural (EPI) analgesia, using a mixture of bupivacaine 0.125%, epinephrine (1.25 micrograms.ml-1) and sufentanil (0.75 micrograms.ml-1) for labor analgesia, and compared them. A total of 110 pregnant patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 1 was excluded because the patient did not have a cervical dilation of 4 cm. Therefore, 110 women with pregnancies at term, in active labor (defined as contraction frequency greater than 5 per 10 minutes, cervical dilation greater than or equal to 4 cm) and having a negative fetal scalp score were assessed prospectively for their inclusion into two groups (CSE or EPI) based on the method used for analgesia during labor and delivery. After the necessary clearance had been obtained, the obstetrical and anesthesia departments randomized the patients so that the parturient, the anesthesiology and the obstetrical staff members were"

This study investigated the effect of 2-week task-specific motor training on the performance of seated reaching tasks, as well as the ability to balance in sitting and walking and cognitive function, after stroke. Findings indicated that task-specific training involving reaching beyond arm’s length improved distances reached and use of affected lower leg to support and balance during seated reaching. Subjects who received training for reaching also improved in sit-to-stand. Neither group improved in walking or cognitive function after training.

This study has implications for therapists and stroke survivors. Results indicate that task-specific exercise that includes activity beyond arm’s length may increase the distance a person can reach while in sitting, and that this training may contribute to improved sit-to-stand. For therapists, rehabilitation approaches that include reaching beyond arm’s length in sitting and during sit-to-stand should be considered as an effective strategy to improve a person’s ability to balance in these tasks after stroke. Furthermore, this study indicates that task-specific training involving reaching beyond arm’s length can be effective for improving the performance of other tasks such as sit-to-stand. For stroke survivors, findings of the present study suggest that their ability to balance in sitting while reaching beyond arm’s length can be improved with specific motor training. Such training may help people with stroke to balance during everyday activities as well as during more difficult tasks such as sit-to-stand."
144,"The abstracts provide insights into the effects of various treatments for Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD), including mandibular movement feedback, occlusal splints, biofeedback, relaxation techniques, acupuncture, and hypnorelaxation. The primary outcome measures in these studies are related to TMD symptoms such as pain, tenderness, and pain-related disability, as well as changes in mandibular movement and function. 

The results of the studies suggest that mandibular movement feedback and occlusal splints are effective treatments for TMD, with improvements in pain, tenderness, and functional ability. Although acupuncture and hypnorelaxation show promising results, the evidence is mixed, and more research is needed to determine the efficacy of these therapies. Overall, the findings suggest that a combination of treatments may be most effective in managing TMD symptoms. 

In terms of scientific integrity, the summary should retain the key findings of each study while avoiding errors, omissions, and bias. It should also maintain clarity and objectivity while communicating the essence of the research findings. 

Conclusion:
Combining the insights from a collection of abstracts can improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of various treatments for TMD. The findings of these studies can inform future research and clinical practice, leading to better management of TMD symptoms. However, caution should be exercised when summarizing multiple studies, and the summary should maintain scientific integrity, clarity, and objectivity."

The use of virtual reality technology in endoscopy training improves the efficacy of the endoscopy training by allowing the endoscopist to develop the necessary skills and techniques of the procedure in a lower risk environment while achieving cost-effectiveness in training compared to conventional training on humans. 
2. The virtual reality simulator-assisted training enables endoscopists to acquire the necessary endoscopic skills and techniques with no or minimal negative consequences to patients, making it a better choice for endoscopy training in novice endoscopists . 
3. Simulator training is proven to significantly shorten the learning curve and reduces the time needed to reach technical competency in the early and mid-term stage of endoscopy training and therefore could be useful in an endoscopy training curriculum, but cannot replace on-patient training . 
4. The use of computer simulation training for novices in upper endoscopy is ineffective and can do harm to the patient; skills acquired using the computer simulator do not translate well into the clinical setting and can prolong the procedure time and adversely affect the patient comfort .

Abstract:
The effectiveness of Naltrexone in preventing relapse among opiate‐dependent patients depends upon compliance with taking Naltrexone. Because compliance may be adversely affected by patient response, Naltrexone patients were seen weekly for 18 months of the study to monitor acceptance of Naltrexone (including self‐reported frequency of dosing, adverse events, adherence to appointment schedule, and problems encountered in social situations while on Naltrexone treatment), and to identify factors related to treatment compliance. The Naltrexone group (n = 43) was compared with a wait‐list control group (n = 28). The mean frequency of Naltrexone self‐reported dosing during the 18‐month treatment phase was 94% (range 55‐130%). 88% of adverse events were related to precipitated abstinence, and in most cases patients were able to deal successfully with these symptoms over time. 79% of problems encountered by patients during treatment reflected a disruption of treatment compliance, and most of these problems were resolved with supportive counseling and discussion. Significant correlations were found between frequency of Naltrexone self‐reported dosing and compliance in completing appointments and with successful completion of the 18‐month treatment phase. Adverse events and problems encountered in social situations were not related to treatment compliance. These data suggest that most opiate‐dependent patients are able to accept (and in fact prefer) Naltrexone treatment on an outpatient basis, and that the most frequently encountered treatment problems can be successfully resolved if counseling and social support are provided."

Purpose: We present the outcomes of a randomized controlled trial of a two-drug regimen (cyclosporine and methotrexate) versus an optimized three-drug regimen (cyclosporine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone) for the treatment of adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

Patients: This prospective, randomized phase II/III trial in adults with AML who underwent a conditioning regimen of fludarabine and total-body irradiation followed by an unrelated donor, matched related donor or mismatched related donor SCT had a primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) . Secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS), cumulative dose of glucocorticoids, incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality.

Methods: 327 patients were allocated either to 3-drug-immunosuppression group (cyclosporine, methotrexate and dexamethasone) or 2-drug-group, with a 1:1 allocation. Patients in group 1 received a total of 60 days of glucocorticoids and patients in group 2 received a total of 30 days of glucocorticoids.

149,"The five studies summarized in this post are all related to the use of zidovudine (AZT) and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in the treatment of HIV infection. The studies examined various combinations of these drugs in terms of their effectiveness in delaying disease progression and improving overall survival, as well as their safety and tolerability.
Study #1 
This study, conducted in cooperation with the National Hemophilia Foundation, compared the efficacy and safety of zidovudine, zalcitabine, and a combination of zidovudine and zalcitabine in patients with advanced HIV disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either single-agent or combination therapy, and the primary outcome was time to disease progression or death.
The study found that combination therapy with zidovudine and zalcitabine was more effective than either agent alone in delaying progression to AIDS or death. Patients treated with combination therapy also had lower rates of severe toxic effects than those treated with zidovudine or zalcitabine monotherapy. A trend analysis suggested that combination therapy may also be more effective than zidovudine monotherapy in patients with higher CD4 cell counts.
While the use of combination therapy was found to be more effective than monotherapy in the treatment of HIV infection, some important limitations of the study should be considered. First, the study only included patients with advanced HIV disease, and the results may not be applicable to patients with earlier-stage disease or those with different risk factors. Second, the study focused primarily on disease progression and survival, and did not evaluate other outcomes such as quality of life or neurocognitive function. Third, the study only lasted for a limited period of time, and the long-term effectiveness and safety of combination therapy are still unknown.

Retinoids enhance differentiation of most epithelial tissues. Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between dietary intake or serum levels of vitamin A and the development of cervical dysplasia and/or cervical cancer. Pilot and phase I investigations demonstrated the feasibility of the local delivery of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) to the cervix using a collagen sponge insert and cervical cap. A phase II trial produced a clinical complete response rate of 50%. 
This randomized phase III trial was designed to determine whether topically applied RA reversed moderate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or severe CIN. 
Analyses were based on 301 women with CIN (moderate dysplasia, 151 women; severe dysplasia, 150 women), evaluated by serial colposcopy, Papanicolaou cytology, and cervical biopsy. Cervical caps with sponges containing either 1.0 mL of 0.372% beta-trans-RA or a placebo were inserted daily for 4 days when women entered the trial, and for 2 days at months 3 and 6. Patients receiving treatment and those receiving placebo were similar with respect to age, ethnicity, birth-control methods, histologic features of the endocervical biopsy specimen and koilocytotic atypia, and percentage of involvement of the cervix at study. Treatment effects were compared using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression methods. Side effects were recorded, and differences were compared using Fisher's exact test. 
RA increased the complete histologic regression rate of CIN II from 27% in the placebo group to 43% in the retinoic acid treatment group (P = .041). No treatment difference between the two arms was evident in the severe dysplasia group. More vaginal and vulvar side effects were seen in"

Study #7: Early relapse in patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma treated with surgery and whole pelvic radiotherapy alone: a randomized controlled trial..
BACKGROUND: Recurrent endometrial carcinoma usually presents at distant sites. Although surgery and whole pelvic radiotherapy (RT) are commonly used in the management of these patients, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. We prospectively assessed the role of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in reducing early relapse in patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with high-risk (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetrics II grade 3 endometrial carcinoma with involvement of less than one-half of myometrium or with invasion of 50% or more) endometrial carcinoma and stage II endometrial carcinoma were randomly assigned to 6 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of a combination of cisplatin 50 mg and epirubicin 40-80 mg or to RT beginning 4-7 weeks after surgery comprising whole pelvic RT (45 Gy; 180 cGy per fraction on a daily basis) and anterior pelvis RT (45 Gy; 180 cGy per fraction on alternate days, given to patients with pelvic node metastases) concurrently with 25 Gy in 15 fractions for prophylactic treatment of the para-aortic lymph nodes.RESULTS: Ninety-four patients entered the study, of whom 45 received chemotherapy and 49 received radiotherapy. The clinical response to chemotherapy was complete in 9 of 20 responders (45%) (partial response, 11 of 20; stable disease, 0 of 20); the response rate was 90% in this group.

Finding #1: Effects of folic acid on fit-frequency and behaviour in epileptics on anticonvulsants.. Phenytoin-induced osteomalacia: prophylaxis with 2,000 units of vitamin D3 daily.. Vitamin D3 given concomitantly with anticonvulsant drugs slows up the changes that occur during treatment. It also prevents the osteomalacia developing. The value of a daily supplement of 2,000 international units of vitamin D in doses greater than the customary may be questioned after these observations suggesting the possibility that osteomalacia is a consequence of the drug therapy and not nutritional in origin.

Introduction:  The burden of severe malaria in young children remains extremely heavy in Africa, the most affected region. Plasmodium falciparum is currently the major cause of severe malaria. In Niger, the estimated nation-wide annual childhood mortality rate is around 330/1000. Malaria accounts for about one-third of child deaths and the vast majority of these are due to severe malaria. Because of the high rates of malnutrition recorded in rural Africa in recent years, it is increasingly difficult to ensure adequate intravenous fluid administration and to avoid other complications due to parenteral therapy. In these circumstances, the use of quinine in children must be re-examined. A recent study demonstrated that oral quinine is well tolerated by young children aged three to nine years . However, very few data are available on the use of oral quinine in young children aged one to three years with severe malaria, partly because of the paucity of alternative treatments. The oral route requires careful supervision. Thus, parenteral therapy is currently the first choice in severe malaria despite the significant inconveniences associated with the use of this route. This is particularly true in children in whom accurate intravenous dosing may be difficult.
The intrarectal route could be an alternative to parenteral treatment of several diseases (e.g. diarrhoea, constipation, and haemorrhoids) with few side effects . The administration of drugs by this route provides significant therapeutic advantage in infants and young children, who are incapable of swallowing. Quinine and quinidine, which are used most commonly for the treatment of malaria, have been administered intrarectally to children with severe malaria with encouraging results . However, the main difficulty in choosing this route lies in its low bioavailability, but the development of new intrarectal quinine preparations may change this situation.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, blood concentration curves, and pharmacokinetic parameters of a new intrarectal application of quinine gluconate (a quinine, quinidine, cinchonine, cinchonidine association (Quinimax)) in malaria treatment in children younger than 5 in Niger.

159,"In reviewing the evidence, a few points are worth mentioning: 
- All studies had relatively small sample sizes, which is likely to have limited their ability to detect significant differences in some of the outcomes. 
- There was a wide range of outcomes measured across the studies, which complicates direct comparisons between them. 
- The study abstracts reported significantly different findings for each endpoint, particularly with regard to postoperative complication rates and hospital stay. 
- Several of the studies reported significant improvements in multiple endpoints, suggesting that the multimodal approach has the potential to provide significant benefits for patients undergoing surgery. 
- Some of the studies reported no differences between groups for some endpoints, such as postoperative pain or length of stay, while others reported significant improvements in those same endpoints. This could be due to differences in patient selection, surgical technique, or other factors, and highlights the importance of individualizing treatment approaches based on patient needs and preferences."

Study #28: Rising to the challenge: treatment of anaemia in patients with cancer. Anaemia is commonly seen in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery, and this study examined the use and efficacy of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) for treatment of anaemia in these patients. Three hundred and forty-five patients with non-myeloid cancer and moderate to severe anaemia received either placebo or rHuEpo 20,000 units/kg three times a week for up to 12 weeks or until development of serious adverse events, initiation of new cytotoxic therapy, or occurrence of unacceptable transfusion-related safety risks. Patients who had been randomized to rHuEpo could, following completion of the study, continue to receive open-label rHuEpo until development of a serious AE. Response rate, change in hemoglobin levels, change in quality of life scores, use of all blood products, and incidence and type of AEs were assessed. Response rate to rHuEpo, defined as an increase in hemoglobin levels of 10 g/l or more at any time during the study, was the same for rHuEpo and placebo recipients (41% each). Patients assigned to rHuEpo in this study had a higher mean total hemoglobin change than did those assigned to placebo during the third cycle (+1.27 g/l versus +0.33 g/l; p < 0.00001). Mean change in total hemoglobin in patients who continued on open-label rHuEpo was 1.73 g/l per 12 weeks. There were also improvements in a number of individual hemoglobin and quality of life parameters in rHuEpo compared with placebo recipients. The percentage of anaemic patients who did not require red cell support was higher in rHuEpo compared with placebo recipients (72% versus 43%; p < 0.0005). In addition, rHuEpo reduced the number of days to red blood cell"
161,"The results from previous studies examining the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics before IUD insertion have been mixed, with some studies showing a reduction in IUD removal for medical reasons (including upper genital tract infection), while others have not established a clear benefit. However, the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease within these populations has been low, which may have contributed to the limited statistical power to detect a significant difference. Overall, the current trial found that doxycycline premedication did not reduce the rate of IUD removal for any reason, including PID infection, within the first year of use. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the potential role of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the risk of complications related to IUD use."

Study #1: Brief Summary
-----------------
RATIONALE: Methotrexate may be effective in combination with temozolomide in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well methotrexate works when given together with temozolomide after surgery in treating patients with brain cancer.
Detailed Description
-----------------
OBJECTIVES: Primary To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate for patients with glioblastoma treated with combination temozolomide and methotrexate following local resection. Secondary To determine the toxicity of this regimen. To determine the time to tumor progression (TTP). To determine the time from initiation of therapy to tumor progression (time2progression [TTP]). To determine the PFS rate for patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide following local resection. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (qd) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive methotrexate IV over 2-3 hours on days 1, 15 and 28 and temozolomide PO qd on days 2, 8, 15 and 22. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 30 days for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

164,"These 21 studies were used to summarize the impact of a water, sanitation and hygiene project in a rural area of Tajikistan. 13 of the 21 studies were reviewed to inform the selection of the primary outcome for the intervention, incidence in cases per 1000 person days at risk of either moderate or severe diarrhoea. The majority of the studies (9 of 13) have been conducted in relatively isolated, rural areas in which the household water treatment and storage intervention would be implemented. The study populations of the studies range in size from 309 children under six years of age to 96 adult volunteers. The duration of the studies ranges from seven to eleven months. 
The study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and details of those studies are provided in the following table of results:
Study Summary, Results and Keywords"
165,"1) Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) improves the clinical status of children with atopic dermatitis. 2) High doses increase the content of GLA in the red cell membrane 3) High doses are required to increase the proportion of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the red cell membrane. 4) Increased content of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids does not alter red cell membrane microviscosity. Our findings support the use of gamma-linolenic acid to improve the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis in children. Intravenous IgG preparations or treatment with oral disodium cromoglycate may influence the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis by suppressing IgE-mediated immune responses. Since these forms of treatment are expensive and are of limited value for long term benefit, GLA is a relatively inexpensive and a non-toxic alternative which is likely to be of much greater use in alleviating the clinical symptoms of atopic dermatitis..

Study #13: Use of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid as a nutritional and therapeutic supplement in atopic dermatitis. An open clinical trial.. The therapeutic potential of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) was assessed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The 6-week trial compared the daily intake of 3.6 g DGLA or placebo in 25 patients with atopic dermatitis. The investigating physician evaluated the clinical condition of the patients by means of the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SSAD), the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), a visual analog scale (VAS) and a 15-item questionnaire. Laboratory results were also obtained, especially changes in phospholipid fatty acids levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Seventeen of the 25 patients treated with DGLA, but only 2 out of the 8 patients on placebo, improved clinically (P < 0.05). No adverse side effects were recorded. In conclusion, our results indicate that DGLA can effectively and safely control"

169,"The randomized trial was conducted from April to September 2006 at the Oral Medicine Department of Alexandria. It included one hundred patients who fulfilled the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were divided randomly into 2 groups, fifty patients in each group. The fluconazole group took 200 mg of fluconazole orally once a day for fourteen days. The itraconazole group took 100 mg of itraconazole orally once a day for fourteen days. At the start of treatment and seven days later, oral lesions were assessed and the clinical and mycological cure rates were determined. The safety evaluation was done throughout the study duration and was not restricted to adverse events. 

The primary outcome was resolution of oral lesions. The secondary outcomes were the mycological cure and the adverse events.

No significant difference was found between fluconazole and itraconazole in the clinical cure rate (p=0.5), and the mycological cure rate (p=0.24). The incidence of adverse events among the patients treated with fluconazole was not statistically significant higher than that of patients treated with itraconazole."
170,"In this paper, I will summarize the collected findings from a collection of studies related to gait and training techniques for Parkinson's disease patients. The findings suggest that exercise and physical therapy may help to improve walking and reduce the risk of falls in this population.
However, more research is needed to better understand the effects of these intervention techniques and to determine the optimal dosage and frequency of the intervention. Future studies could focus on exploring different types of exercises and training techniques, as well as the impact of modifying antiparkinsonian medications on the effectiveness of these interventions.
Overall, the findings presented in this paper highlight the potential benefits of exercise and physical therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease. These interventions may help improve the quality of life for these patients by reducing their risk of falls and improving their physical functioning. 
Moreover, these findings provide important insights into the effectiveness of different intervention techniques. By better understanding the impact of these interventions, healthcare providers can develop more tailored treatment plans for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders.

171,"1. Chest physiotherapy in Cystic Fibrosis using different treatment modalities (PD, PEP, and HFCC) had an effect on the clearance of mucous from the lungs. But they did not vary much between them.
2. Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) in CF patients in addition to sputum clearance also improved lung function. PEP was found to be efficient than Active Cycle Exercise Therapy (ACT) which is done while walking on the spot.
3. PEP-induced lung function improvement per milliliter of sputum produced was significantly lower for those patients with airway hyperreactivity. The fact that the highest sputum yield with PEP was not reflected in higher PEP-effected lung function changes might thus be explained by PEP-induced bronchospasm in patients with airway hyperreactivity. PEP is safe in the absence of the complications mentioned above.
4. Self-administered chest physiotherapy (PT) using any of the physiotherapy techniques has increased the production of sputum in patients with Cystic Fibrosis who do not require hospitalization.

173,"Based on the provided abstracts, it appears that the use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) has reduced myelosuppression and associated toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients receiving high-risk protocols. The study by Ploetz et al. (Study #4) showed a significant reduction in the duration of febrile neutropenia, culture-confirmed infections, and duration of intravenous antibiotic administration when r-metHuG-CSF was administered prophylactically in the interval between chemotherapy courses. The study by Staehelin-Asschenfeldt et al. (Study #5) further demonstrated that r-metHuG-CSF increased the chemotherapy dose-intensity (CDI) delivered to patients during consolidation chemotherapy, resulting in higher intensity compared to those not receiving G-CSF. The authors attributed this to shorter post-R3 intervals in the G-CSF group, while the post-COPADM intervals were not statistically reduced. It is important to note that shorter post-R3 intervals and higher CDI were not associated with improved disease control, as indicated by the 3-year probability of event-free survival. 

Study findings have suggested that r-metHuG-CSF may improve compliance with treatment schedules and facilitate tighter adherence to the therapeutic regimen. While r-metHuG-CSF has demonstrated positive effects in reducing myelosuppression and associated toxicities, its impact on disease control is still unclear. 

Another study found that while r-metHuG-CSF increased the CDI in high-risk ALL patients, it did not lead to improved disease control (Study #6). However, this study also highlights a potential clinical benefit in the form of shorter median hospital stays and fewer documented infections with the use of G-CSF. 

Overall, it can be concluded from this collection of study abstracts that while r-metHuG-CSF has demonstrated some positive effects in pediatric ALL patients receiving high-risk protocols, its impact on disease control is still unclear. Future studies are needed to further explore the"

Study #8: Health service utilization for family planning: evidence from a survey on contraceptive prevalence of two districts in Uttar Pradesh, India.
Background & Objectives: This paper focuses on the issue of utilization of family planning services provided by public sector program in relation to individual characteristics and socio-economic determinants of family planning use. The study focuses on the question as to who uses a given type of contraceptive method and what factors shape individual decisions.
It further investigates the extent to which family planning service utilization varies with the characteristics of both users and non-users at individual and household levels as well as between public and private sector providers.
Research has shown that women having multiple births, women belonging to higher income classes and women with higher levels of education are more likely to adopt contraception. Research also indicates that rural women are more likely to use family planning services provided by private providers like pharmacies. Hence, an in-depth analysis of the issue of family planning services utilization is warranted in the light of emerging findings of a recent WHO’s report on the health sector reform.
The study seeks to investigate both demand and supply factors of contraceptive use as perceived by the women themselves. Women’s views on issues such as the choice of family planning method and the accessibility of facilities offering family planning services are also taken into account in order to enrich existing knowledge and to suggest improvements to the existing family planning service-delivery system.
Materials & Methods: This study is the outcome of a larger study on determinants of contraceptive use, the design and methodology of which are described elsewhere. This study is based on a survey of a random sample of married women in two districts in western UP in India who had at least one live birth. The women were interviewed about a range of family planning and demographic variables and also provided data on their socio-economic characteristics, such as age, education, occupation, religion etc., as well as data on socio-economic characteristics of her household, such as assets, income etc..
The sample for the study comprised of a random sample of 1188 married women from three districts of UP India (see Figure-3 for the districts’ information and the map of study districts).

Study #14: Radiation dose estimation of a dual-source computed tomography scanner using different tube potentials .
PURPOSE: To estimate the radiation dose of the dual-source CT scanner using different tube potentials for routine clinical use.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A conventional scan and a four-phase contrast-enhanced abdomen scan were acquired with both the 120 kVp tube and its 80 kVp companion tube. The effective dose was calculated for each CT scan using the organ-based method. The average effective dose for a conventional chest scan, chest-abdomen scan, abdominopelvic scan, and contrast-enhanced abdomen scan was estimated using statistical analysis. Contrast dose was estimated with both tube potentials for each examination. The dose index (DI) was also calculated for each scan.RESULTS: For a conventional chest scan, the effective dose was 0.2 mSv for the 80 kVp tube and 0.6 mSv for the 120 kVp tube, with a corresponding contrast dose as high as 57%. For a chest-abdomen scan, the effective dose was 1.0 mSv for the 80 kVp tube and 1.2 mSv for the 120 kVp tube with a 13.2% contrast dose reduction for the 80 kVp tube. For abdominopelvic scanning, the effective dose was 2.7 mSv for the 80 kVp tube and 1.6 mSv for the 120 kVp tube, with a 42% contrast dose reduction for the 80 kVp tube. The contrast dose index for the 80 kVp tube was only half that for the 120 kVp tube when 80 mL of contrast agent was injected.CONCLUSION: The dual-source CT scanner with 80 kVp tube offers dose reduction of 50%-80% for conventional chest and chest-abdomen CT scans. For abdominopelvic scanning the dose reduction is approximately half when the 80 kVp tube and the standard 120 kVp"

1. Hypertonic saline (HS) increased urine excretion and decreased urine sodium and blood urea
2. HS increases sodium and osmolarity and decreases blood urea 
3. Hypertonic solution, HS, decreased intraoperative urine output and increased blood urea as compared to LR in group
4. HS decreased the need for postoperative fluid administration and the overall weight gain: 85% less fluid requirement was seen in group  
5. LR infusion compared to HS infusion increases perioperative body fluid gain in patients undergoing AAA repair, 
6. HS did not cause any complications such as intracranial hypertension, convulsions, arrhythmias, or ischemic signs in patients with stable neurological status were considered for randomization, 
7. HS infusion did not create any haemodynamic disturbance as shown from similar MAP and cardiac output after reperfusion between two groups, 
8. HS infusion decreased the weight gain by improving urine output: on one hand HS decreased urine excretion, on other hand there was increase in urine excretion and decrease in blood urea N.B. HS infusion reduced the perioperative weight gain from 14% in LR group to 85% in HS group:
9. HS has good effect as diuretic in reducing the intraoperative urine output.
Introduction:
Hypertonic solutions have diuretic effect and can be used as a substitute for the conventional isotonic solutions in surgery. 
The hypertonicity of the solution helps to get rid of excessive water and sodium gained by the patients during surgery and also prevents inadvertent fluid overload. Hypertonic solutions are used as a substitute for isotonic solution in case of excessive fluid loss or fluid overload. Different concentrations of hypertonic fluid replacement have been used in literature with reported benefits. 
The present study is conducted at the surgical intensive care unit of Aga Khan University hospital to assess the effects of hypertonic saline (HS) and isotonic lactated Ringer's (LR) solution as a intravenous"
178,"I think it's important to include information about the specific context of the interventions being studied. For example, were the interventions primarily targeted at adolescents or adults, or were they designed to be used with a specific patient population (e.g., those with a history of mental illness)? Were the interventions delivered as part of a longer-term treatment program, or were they intended to be stand-alone interventions? This information will help in understanding how the interventions were developed and tested, and how their effectiveness may vary under different circumstances.
Introduction: 
While I agree that the introduction should provide an overview of the overall research question and objectives of the paper, I believe it is also important to include a brief description of the specific interventions being studied, and what exactly the study authors attempted to do with those interventions. For example, the authors could provide a brief overview of each intervention, including its theoretical or conceptual basis, the specific techniques or strategies used, and the target population. This information will help in situating the interventions within the broader context of AIDS/HIV research, and understanding how they differ from previous or similar interventions.
Results: 
While I think most of the results were clearly presented and analysed, I think there are a few areas where additional clarification would be helpful. For example, it would be helpful to provide more specific information about the participants who were included in each group. For example, were there any significant differences between the participants in the Intervention Group, the Wait-list Group, and the Control Group? If so, what were those differences and how did they impact the results of the study?
Moreover, I think it would be helpful to include more information about how the study authors measured or evaluated the effectiveness of each intervention. For example, what specific outcome measures were used to assess each aspect of the intervention, and what were the results obtained from those outcome measures? This information will help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each intervention, and in assessing their effectiveness under different circumstances. 
Conclusion: 
I like the overall conclusion, but I think it would be helpful to include more specific information about how the study authors plan to apply the results of their research in future practice or policy. For example, what are the implications of these findings for other settings or populations, and what steps should be taken to ensure that these interventions are effectively implemented and evaluated in those settings or populations? This information will help in"
179,"1. The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-week pectoral muscle training course as a form of rehabilitation. This is of interest to us since pectoral surgery (breast augmentation, mammoplasty, and reduction) appears to often adversely affect shoulder range of motion. To study this, thirty women, 20 normal and 10 post-mastectomy, were submitted to three weeks of unilateral and bilateral pectoral muscle training. At the end of training, the shoulders flexed and abducted through greater angles whereas all measures of external rotation and rotation strength were significantly improved in subjects receiving bilateral training compared to the other two groups. Subjects with post-mastectomy were not able to improve any measure of shoulder function to the degree of subjects without surgery..

Study #57: The effect of flupenthixol and fluphenazine on extrapyramidal reactions during discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in chronic schizophrenics: a double-blind trial.. 13 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia treated at home for 2 years with fluphenazine decanoate 25 mg every 4 weeks or flupenthixol decanoate 25 mg every 4 weeks (both preparations containing 90 mg of the base drug), were included in a substitution study in which the base drug was gradually replaced with an equivalent amount of one of the placebo preparations. The base drug was then discontinued. The following extrapyramidal symptoms were scored weekly during the 6-week study by both the patient and a psychiatrist with the aid of the OPC-R and Marder scales (OPC-R, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Check List, RM, Rush Mania Rating Scale and Marder, Dystonia rating scale): 1) Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Check List; 2) Marder (Dystonia), Schizophrenia Rating Scale; OPC-R, Rush Mania Rating Scale, were not scored.

181,"Based on these abstracts, it appears that functional appliances such as twin blocks, bionators, and herbst appliances can be effective in treating Class II Division 1 malocclusions. Treatment with these appliances can result in reductions in overjet, correction of molar relationships, and improvements in both skeletal and dental positions. The combination of headgear and bionator treatments may also be effective in correcting skeletal discrepancies. 
However, it is important to note that the magnitude of any changes will vary depending on the specific appliance used, compliance with treatment, and patient characteristics. Research has shown that some functional appliances may be more effective than others, with certain appliances producing greater skeletal and dental changes. 
In addition, the findings of these studies suggest that functional appliances might be no more clinically effective than conventional, 1-phase orthodontic treatment methods, particularly if they are started before adolescence. 
To better understand the comparative effectiveness of different functional appliances and treatment modalities, larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to measure outcomes such as relapse, satisfaction, and patient preference. Such studies should also examine the longer-term effects of functional appliances, including any potential adverse effects. 
These findings have important implications for the use of functional appliances in clinics. While they may be effective treatment options, clinicians should consider a variety of factors, including patient age, compliance, and individual variability in treatment response, when deciding whether to prescribe functional appliance treatment. 
Overall, evidence suggests that functional appliances are effective treatments for Class II Division 1 malocclusion. While these appliances might be no more clinically effective than traditional treatments, they offer a minimally invasive option for patients and provide a viable alternative to complex surgeries.."
182,"1) In the study of Kokich et al, the reduction in mean width was greatest for the perpendicular measurements (mean reduction of 1.5 mm with immediate implants and 0.7 mm with delayed implants). 
2) Delayed dehiscence defects demonstrated a larger marginal reduction (47%) compared with dehiscence defects placed immediately (34%). 
3) In the study of Kornmann, the survival rates were 91% in the immediate group and 96% in the delayed group. A similar trend was observed in the study of Kokich with immediate and delayed implants failing at a similar rate. 
4) According to the study of Kornmann, spontaneous healing of up to 2 mm in the perpendicular direction occurred, whereas spontaneous healing was observed to be only between 0.5 to 1 mm when compared to the study of Kokich. The difference of 1 mm could be due to the fact that larger defects were addressed in the former study when compared to the latter. 
5) According to the study of Kornmann, no statistical difference was found in mean ISQ values, gingival aesthetics and radiographic bone resorption. 
6) According to the study of Kornmann, the immediate restoration of single implants in the esthetic zones performed on implants placed immediately after tooth extraction or 8 weeks later (immediate replacement vs. immediate restoration) demonstrated no statistically significant differences in any of the studied parameters between the test and the control groups. 
7) According to the study of Kokich, no significant differences for VDH (mean 75.4%) and HDD (mean 77%) reduction in the immediate replacement vs. immediate restoration groups were found. Significant differences were observed between groups for HDW reduction (range, 34.1-67.3%). 
8) According to the study of Kokich, the presence of dehiscence defects of the labial plate led to HDW reduction of 66.6%.

For the eight trials that showed a significant difference in the reduction in cholesterol levels between the two groups, it appears that individual advice that has been provided by a dietitian is more successful in leading to the reduction of blood cholesterol levels than is the administration of a diet fact sheet. If only one-third of the population are discovered by the primary health care system and follow the treatment advice, the net savings in the low-intensity model compared to the current Swedish guidelines here presented as the moderate-intensity model are estimated to be SEK 93 million..

Intervention Description:: The interventions used in the two studies were different. Therefore, the intervention was not replicated in a subsequent clinical trial. To reduce high levels of blood cholesterol in the United States population, the investigators conducted a randomized, controlled trial of two different intervention strategies for the non-pharmacological treatment of hypercholesterolemia in a community setting. The purpose of the clinical trial was to test the relative efficacy of different interventions and to estimate their cost effectiveness. This trial was conducted in Vårby Health Centre, a primary care practice located in a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden. Out of the 42,102 nonpharmacologically treated patients, 12,862 men and women were chosen arbitrarily from this population. These patients were then screened for hypercholesterolemia. One in thirteen of the patients was randomly allocated to either no intervention or to a low- or medium-intensity intervention strategy. The investigators selected three different strategies for nonpharmacological treatment, and randomly allocated patients to one of these three strategies. The patients were allocated in a way that 76% of the individuals would receive the low-intensity, basic and conventional intervention strategy (the Swedish low-int"

1. Cognitive training is a valuable tool to improve cognitive skills for patients with MS.
2. Moderate to severely impaired patients benefit more from cognitive training.
3. Neuropsychological counseling is effective in enhancing social behavior in MS patients.
4. Specific training programmes for MS patients effectively improve memory, attention and executive function performance.
5. Neuropsychological training programmes for MS patients show positive effects on self-reported quality of life, fatigue, and depression.
6. Cognitive intervention may benefit patients with MS and baseline brain atrophy.
7. Unit management of depression of MS patients using cognitive remediation strategies is beneficial to reduce depression scores in this population.
8. Intensive neuropsychological rehabilitation of attention, information processing and executive functions is effective in patients with RR MS and low levels of disability, and also leads to improvement in depression.

Study #12: Randomized controlled trial of cognitive training in multiple sclerosis - a report of Cogmed Research Centre.
We report on the treatment outcomes of 53 people with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) participating in a large multi-site trial of Cogmed working memory training in Australia and Sweden. Participants were randomly assigned to training or waiting condition. We found a statistically significant effect of training, such that people who underwent training demonstrated a significantly greater improvement on the Working Memory Index (WMI) and associated subtests of Digit Span (Forwards) (DSP) and Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) than those who only received treatment-as-usual (TAU).

Study #13: A randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation and occupational therapy: application in multiple sclerosis.
Introduction: Cognitive impairments in multiple sclerosis (MS) are among the most disabling symptoms of this illness. While the importance of cognitive rehabilitation and the usefulness of Occupational Therapy (OT) for managing the impact of cognition in everyday function have been well established, few evidence-based treatment protocols are available. Recently developed cognitive remediation (CR) interventions can potentially be used in the management of cognitive difficulties in MS, but need to be evaluated.

To establish if peer approval (as measured by approval of boys in other classrooms) was related to physical self-concept scores. 3. To determine if self-concept scores were related to actual physical fitness achievement. 4. To examine if a 4-month physical endurance training program affected physical self-concept scores, peer approval scores, and actual physical fitness achievement. 5. To determine if the physical endurance training had any residual effect on physical self-concept scores, peer approval scores, and actual physical fitness achievement..
Participation of boys in grades 5-8 in a physical endurance training program has a positive effect on actual physical fitness achievement, but not on physical self-concept or peer approval.  A physical endurance training programs effect on peer approval ratings and self-concept ratings are dependent on how physically well-endowed a child was.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Cranberry (C. macroprum) is a native shrub, mainly found in the American continent and especially in Canada. Its fruits and leaves have been used since the 16th century as natural remedies and medicine. In particular, it is renowned for treating urinary tract infections (UTI) and more recently, there is growing evidence that it is also beneficial in supporting the function of the cardiovascular system as well as in managing some other chronic health conditions such as the management of diabetes. The juice preparation (Crataevum marocarum) from cranberry fruit is considered safe, well tolerated and efficacious for supporting health. Uganda is one of countries with high UTI prevalence due to improper bladder management as some people particularly women in the rural setting mainly use the unhygienic water bodies to answer the call of nature and thus, exposing their genitals to environmental pathogens such as E. coli, the major cause of UTIs. We hypothesize that cranberry juice will reduce bacterial load in the gut and reduce the risk of UTIs in HIV positive adults.

191,"The studies reviewed in this paper suggest that triflusal is an effective drug for preventing vascular events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Triflusal may have a lower risk of hemorrhagic complications when compared with aspirin. However, the sample size in this pilot trial was small and additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.  
Triflusal may be an alternative treatment for patients who are intolerant to aspirin or who have a high risk of hemorrhagic complications. Researchers should conduct larger, more rigorous clinical trials to better understand the potential benefits and risks of triflusal in the prevention of vascular events.
The use of triflusal in patients with cardiovascular disease, including stroke or TIA, should be carefully considered by healthcare providers in light of the existing evidence and the potential benefits and risks of the drug.

192,"We were able to combine the study results and understand that opioid therapy for chronic back pain can be an effective treatment option, as it helps to reduce pain and improve mood. We also learned that there are few differences in activity or hours asleep, and that the tapered-off opioid treatment is palliative and without long-term benefit. 
Opioid therapy can be a viable treatment option for chronic back pain, but it is crucial to monitor patients closely for signs of abuse and noncompliance. It is also important to taper off opioid treatment gradually to avoid any adverse effects.

Study #5: Ultracet versus placebo for treatment of chronic low back pain in a U.S. clinical practice setting: a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel trial with intent to treat analysis focusing on back pain patients treated in general medical practice.. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a tramadol/acetaminophen (APAP) combination tablet (Ultracet) versus placebo for the treatment of chronic low back pain (NLBP).
                A 12-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, comparator-controlled, intent-to-treat (ITT) trial was performed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. All enrolled patients were treated in general medical practice. Eligible patients were between 18 and 75 years of age with a history of NLBP for at least 6 months prior to screening, despite adequate treatment. Exclusion criteria included a history of severe hepatic insufficiency, severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance value less than 30 mL/min), or a history of opioid-induced hyperalgesia.
                Patients were randomized to tramadol/APAP combination tablets (1 to 4 tablets per day orally) or placebo to evaluate pain relief measured by 2 composite measures: pain VAS (0-100 mm VAS, higher scores indicate greater pain relief) from baseline to endpoints and percent improvement from baseline to endpoints based on change in pain VAS (<10-10-20-25-30-"
193,"The provided study abstracts relate to a randomized clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania. The results of the study indicate that compared to placebo, olanzapine has a superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania, with approximately half of the patients treated with olanzapine showing a positive response. However, the addition of valproate or lithium to olanzapine treatment provides significantly more benefits than olanzapine alone. The adverse events associated with olanzapine are mostly gastrointestinal-related (e.g. somnolence, increased appetite, weight gain). Some other adverse events are tremor, slurred speech, and dry mouth. The results of this study support the use of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania, both as a monotherapy and in combination with valproate or lithium. It also suggests that the addition of valproate or lithium to olanzapine treatment provides significant benefits in improving the response rate and remission rate of patients with acute mania."
194,"Study #25: Patient-provider interactions in the treatment of hypertension.. The present study was designed replicate and extend the findings of a recently published study (Falke, Goldberg, & Tsuura, 1997). Patients receiving their medical care at the Community Health Center of San Mateo County, in Northern California, were recruited voluntarily into a clinic-based, randomized, controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two approaches to hypertension management. The first, traditional medical management emphasizes advice giving; the second, integrative medical management, encompasses a patient-centered approach in which motivational interviewing and behaviorally based skill building techniques are combined with advice giving. Participant assessment during a 12-month follow-up period indicated that the integrative medical management intervention was significantly more effective in reducing the incidence of hypertension-related cardiovascular events. The results of this study confirmed the efficacy of integrative medical management, indicated that some patients benefited from this approach more than from traditional medical management, and documented the influence of patient-provider interactional processes on patient adherence to medical recommendations. 

Study #26: Increasing patients' compliance with their therapy through the use of contracts and rewards.. A study of 33 mentally retarded patients was undertaken to determine whether a procedure of making a contract and presenting a reward would increase compliance with their therapy. The therapy in question had already been established as being effective in controlling the behaviour being measured. The study sought to determine to what extent compliance would increase as a result of using a contract. The first part of the study used two matched blocks (a block of three patients and a block of four patients) who had previously been in treatment with no contract or reward present. These blocks had a high rate of compliance, but this was as a result of their natural motivation to comply with the therapy, which the therapist reported as excellent. The second part of the study used two matched blocks (one of three and one of four patients) which had not previously been in treatment. In these blocks a contract and reward was used; these patients could be regarded as having little prior motivation to comply with the therapy programme. The results obtained from the use of contracts and rewards did produce a significantly greater increase in the compliance rate with the patients who were in the second treatment period. Consequently, the use of a contract and reward does appear to increase compliance rates"
195,"The main results of this review are as follows: 
Study conclusions: 
In summary, there is level II evidence that home-based exercises reduce muscle weakness in non-ambulatory elderly people at risk of falling. There is level II evidence that home-based exercises have beneficial effects on function and quality of life in elderly people after hip fracture. These exercise programs can be undertaken with or without the assistance of a therapist and can be undertaken at a wide range of exercise intensities. Physical therapy and resistance training have different mechanisms of improving leg extensor muscle power, with resistance training producing greater increases in muscle power. These exercise programs need to be of a considerable intensity and should preferably be of a progressive nature. There is level I evidence that intensive post-operative physical therapy and resistance training have no effect on the duration of rehabilitation following hip fracture. There is level III evidence that intensive home-based exercise and neurostimulation has beneficial effects on pain in elderly people with hip fracture. Neurostimulation requires more research. 
The limitations of this review are that most of this evidence is based on small trials and therefore conclusions need to be made with caution. Most trials used only one outcome measure and this makes synthesis difficult. There is a greater need for evidence-based exercise programs in this population and this is particularly true for the elderly patient who has suffered from a hip fracture. Randomised controlled trials have been completed involving patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery, amputations and other conditions. Many of these trials have been performed through orthopaedic surgery research clubs around the world. These trials have consistently provided level I evidence. Unfortunately, the hip fracture patient has been neglected to a large extent, which is reflected in the limited amount of evidence available in this review. We hope that this review will encourage further trials in this area of rehabilitation medicine."
196,"From the provided abstracts, it is clear that there is a significant association between asthma and gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and that the treatment of GER in patients with asthma can improve various aspects of asthma control, including respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function, as well as quality of life and medication use.  In some cases, the improvement in asthma symptoms and pulmonary function has been significant, leading to a reduced need for bronchodilator medication and improved quality of life.  However, the exact mechanism by which GER interacts with asthma to cause these symptoms and effects is still not fully understood, and research on this topic continues."
197,"According to the findings of these studies, swimming may be a suitable form of exercise for children with asthma. Swimming has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve cardiorespiratory fitness in children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Swimming may also help to reduce the risk of exercise induced asthma attacks, which can cause difficulty breathing and other negative health effects. Swimming programs, which are specifically designed to cater to children with asthma, may also help to reduce inflammation in airways, reduce airway resistance and help to reduce symptoms of asthma.

Some of the studies also suggest that individualized swimming training programs, which are tailored to the specific needs and abilities of the child, may be particularly effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in children with asthma. In these studies, individualized swimming training programs that were specifically designed to meet the individual needs of the child resulted in improved cardiorespiratory fitness, reduced symptoms of asthma and increased airway capacity.

It is important to note that the studies reviewed in this paper only include a relatively small number of participants, and the participants in these studies were all children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the benefits of swimming for children with asthma and to determine if swimming can be beneficial for children with mild asthma or children with other types of lung disease.

199,"The following key points summarize the literature on the topic:
- There seems to be a consensus point in the literature that immediate umbilical cord clamping (UCC) is standard at 35-40 weeks' gestation, whilst delayed UCC has proven benefits in the prevention of anemia, especially for premature infants (< 35 weeks' gestation).
- An optimal timing of UCC in premature infants (25-34 weeks' gestation) is yet to be identified.
- Although a 1-minute delay in cord clamping significantly increased RBC volume/mass and Hct, clinical benefits were modest.
- Based on these findings, clinicians should balance the benefits of potential postnatal benefits against the risks of the procedure.
- In practice, delayed UCC is usually performed when UCC cannot be performed immediately.
- Although a precise definition of placental transfusion has not been reached, it is widely agreed that about two-thirds of the maternal placental blood is transmitted to the newborn infant at birth."
200,"BACKGROUND: Intravenously administered urokinase (UK) thrombolysis has been shown to be safe and beneficial in the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It has been postulated that pulmonary thromboembolism (TE) occurs as a result of clots in the venous system extending into the pulmonary artery and obstructing pulmonary blood flow due to thrombi being located within the right heart or pulmonary circulation. The rationale for treating PE patients with UK infusion is based on the assumption that this agent, because of its fibrin specificity, can dissolve the thrombus obstructing blood flow into the lungs and improve right heart output thus enhancing arterial oxygenation. In patients with acute DVT, UK infusion has been shown to reduce clot volume and size and to improve thrombus lysis at angiography. Recently, UK infusion in patients with acute PE and pulmonary hypertension has been shown to reduce right heart output and to improve the degree of right heart enlargement. 
AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of UK infusion in the treatment of acute PE. 
INTERIM FINDINGS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase 1 trial of UK infusion for the treatment of acute PE (Study I0304; NCT00032853) was performed in 20 patients with PE. Twenty patients received 250,000 units UK over an 8 hour period, with a minimum of 50,000 units and a maximum of 150,000 units infused per hour or 1750 IU/h. Eleven patients received 500,000 units (500 milliunits/h). Each patient served as his/her own control, being randomized to either the UK treatment or placebo group at the beginning of the UK infusion. Patients were monitored for changes in clinical status and evidence of treatment effects by echocardiography, lung scans, or pulmonary artery catheterization. No differences were seen in hemodynamic changes, changes in the right to left ventric"

202,"This study was designed to investigate the response rate, tolerance, and survival period of patients with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with a combination of 4'-epirubicin (EPIR), 5-fluorouacil (5-FU), and CDDP (P). Thirty-five patients who were not suitable for surgical treatment for their malignant tumor or whose tumor had recurred 4 weeks after surgery, were included in this study and were divided randomly in a 3 to 1 ratio into 2 groups; FP (CDDP + 5-FU, n = 27) and FPEPIR (EPIR + 5-FU + CDDP, n = 8). The patients included in Groups P and EP were required to be in sufficiently good general condition to be treated adequately with this regimen and had a life expectancy of 1 year or more.

Introduction:  The results of chemotherapy performed for the treatment of gastric cancer have been disappointing. 5-FU, a cytotoxic agent acting primarily against cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, has been the only drug that has consistently produced objective remissions in patients with gastric cancer when administered either alone, or in combination with other agents.[1][2][3][4] However, the response rates of 5-FU alone or in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) were only 5% to 20% and the median survival time was only 8 to 12 months. In this study, we report the results of FPEPIR combined chemotherapies for previously untreated or recurrent gastric cancer patients.
Subjects and Methods:  Patients with unresectable gastric cancer were randomly assigned (3:1) into 2 treatment regimens: the FP regimen, consisting of CDDP (50 mg/body, d1) + 5-FU (250 mg/body, d2-d5), or the FPEPIR regimen, CDDP+5-FU (FP) + 4’-EPIR (30 mg/m2, d2), administered intravenously every 2 weeks.

Background
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a condition in which a traumatic head injury or a ruptured aneurysm results in hemorrhage in the open spaces between the arachnoid and the pia matter. If it goes undiagnosed (which is often the case), SAH can have fatal consequences (1). Although some degree of impairment after SAH is expected, many patients experience a severe decline in their neurological status during the first 3 months after the initial diagnosis (2). Patients commonly experience delays in diagnosis resulting from the fact that subarachnoid hemorrhage is only detectable in 50%-75% of cases. However, once the condition is properly diagnosed, it is treatable.
Aneurysms are vascular anomalies in which a small outward bulge occurs in a blood vessel. If the blood vessel in which the aneurysm is located bursts, SAH can occur. The most common type of aneurysm is a saccular aneurysm, which is characterized by a blood vessel bulging out into a balloon shape.
A second type of aneurysm - the fusiform aneurysm - is also encountered frequently. This type of aneurysm is characterized by the blood vessel being widened and flattened by the accumulation of blood. Fusiform aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body but are most commonly found in the aorta. Although fusiform aneurysms are much less likely to burst than saccular aneurysms, they can be very dangerous if they develop on the aorta.

205,"55 young healthy female volunteers were recruited for the study, 47 completed the study and were included in the analysis. At 1 day after the first administration 47 patients were included in the analysis. Treatment was started within 4 hours after onset of symptoms. The efficacy assessment comprised 2 visits in the morning and 1 visit in the afternoon and was performed on days 1, 3 and 5 after the first intake of trial product. Patients kept on recording their nasal symptom score and medication intake (days 1–7). Two questionnaires were administered for assessment of side effects and global therapeutic appreciation.
Baseline Characteristics of the Female Patients: n.= Number of Patients
• Nasal Symptom Score: Symptom score based on assessment: 0, no symptoms; 0.5, mild symptoms; 1, moderate symptoms; 1.5, severe symptoms; 2, very severe symptoms.
• Global Therapeutic Efficacy: 0.8 x Score (0–4) + 0.1 x Score range (0–4), 0.8 score corresponding to score assigned by patient and 0.1 score corresponding to score range assigned by patient. 0 means ‘Not efficient’ (0–4 scale), 10 means ‘Very efficient’ (10–15 scale).

206,"The study was a single-blind prospective randomised double centre study carried out in adult patients requiring manipulation of an acute, displaced distal radius fracture, to assess the effects of diazepam and sodium nitroprusside as an adjunct to intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) in promoting relaxation of the wrist muscles and improving radiological outcome.
Patients were randomly assigned to:
IVRA (bupivacaine 2.5 per cent) alone or with 2mg of diazepam as an IV bolus.
IVRA with the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside infused at 2 micrograms per kg per minute.
IVRA with the bolus dose of diazepam in addition to the nitroprusside infusion
Patients in all groups experienced approximately similar sensory blockade of 45 minutes, but the average pain score during manipulation was significantly lower in patients receiving diazepam (p less than 0.001) and in patients receiving both the vasodilator and the benzodiazepine (p less than 0.005). Diazepam was associated with a trend to a better short-term radiological outcome (p = 0.089) but there were no significant differences in long-term outcomes. The incidence of complications was similar in all groups with no significant differences in operative time, IVRA administration time, blood pressure, heart rate, or pulse oximetry saturation. There was no significant effect on the time taken for patients to leave the operating theatre, but there was a trend towards more rapid discharge from recovery. We conclude that intravenous diazepam is an effective, safe and practical means of facilitating fracture manipulation in the adult patient, and should be considered as an alternative to the more expensive intravenous regional anaesthesia vasodilators, or can be used in conjunction with these drugs to improve pain relief.

210,"The provided study abstracts demonstrate a wide range of outcomes related to the use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with a specific focus on the treatment of persistent symptoms and cognitive impairment.

Overall, the studies suggest that supplementing with EPA may not provide significant improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia and may not be more effective than placebo in reducing persistent ongoing symptoms. However, these results were based on small sample sizes and may not be representative of a larger population.

Additionally, there is evidence that EPA supplementation can improve cognitive function, with some studies suggesting a positive correlation between improvement in cognitive function and increase in red blood cell arachidonic acid concentrations.

A combination of these effects may suggest a potential role for EPA supplementation in improving cognitive function and reducing persistent ongoing symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Further research with larger samples and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings and determine the effectiveness and safety of EPA supplementation as a supplemental treatment option for patients with these conditions."

213,Conclusion:
214,"According to the provided literature, the efficacy of treating the common cold with steam inhalation is controversial and more studies are needed to determine its effectiveness. The study #2 suggests that steam inhalation does not improve subjective cold symptoms or reduce nasal resistance, and may even have a negative effect. Study #3 provided a single randomized double-blind trial that observed 87 unselected patients with typical acute nasal and upper respiratory symptoms. This study demonstrated an 18% decrease in symptom scores in the steam inhalation group compared to the placebo group. Study #2 conducted a similar randomized placebo-controlled trial, which did not obtain any significant improvements with respect to symptom scores or nasal resistance in either group. Furthermore, Study #4 observed an absence of beneficial effects of two steam inhalation treatments in rhinovirus infected volunteers. Study #5 did not record benefits from steam inhalation treatment with respect to objective measurements of nasal resistance, despite observing better symptom scores in the placebo group. Therefore, the current literature seems to suggest that the use of steam inhalation for the treatment of the common cold is not effective."
215,"The studies above suggest that a combination of glucocorticoid  (e.g., mifepristone, dehydroepiandrosterone, hydrocortisone) and glucocorticoid antagonist (e.g., metyrapone) therapies may improve psychotic depression, depression with high levels of cortisol, cognitive function and mood as compared to placebo.
Introduction: 


Psychotic major depression (PMD) is a relatively common psychiatric condition characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and dysphoric mood. It has been hypothesized that dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. In the context of severe stress or trauma in the immediate aftermath and in cases of major depression, increases in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) have been observed, which in turn cause increased HPA axis cortisol release leading to an increase in hypercortisolemia. These changes may trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms. Psychotic major depression (PMD) is found to be a relatively common psychiatric condition that affects up to nearly 20% of patients with major depression. There is evidence that a large proportion of patients with major depression have increased HPA cortisol release which is correlated with increased levels of depression.

The relationship between hypercortisolemia and depression suggests that antiglucocorticoid agents should have antidepressant effects, but previous studies failed to show a positive effect of antiglucocorticoid agents in major depression when administered alone or in combination with conventional antidepressants. This study examined the efficacy of an antiglucocorticoid agent (mifepristone) in a subgroup of patients with a primary diagnosis of PMD as compared to antiglucocorticoid or control treatments. 
Materials and Methods: Forty of the study's fifty patients with PMD were treated with mifepristone, 500 mg/day, while the other 15 patients were treated with either dexamethasone (10 of the patients), 10 mg/day or placebo (10 of the patients) for seven days in"
216,"1. 10% of water can dilute aspirin to near-inactive concentration. 2. 10% citric acid can dilute aspirin to 3.85 mg/ml, 5.79 mg/ml or 8.73 mg/ml, depending on the concentration of citric acid. 3. 2% of lemon juice or orange juice can dilute aspirin to 9.01 mg/ml or 1-1.5 mg/ml. 4. Sodas and fruit juices generally do not dilute aspirin below active dose of 4-4.8 mg/ml. 5. In summary, water will effectively dilute the active dose of aspirin to inactive concentration when 9.5 ml of aspirin was mixed with 100 ml of water. However, citric acid, lemon and orange juice are not effective in diluting aspirin. The above results are based on limited testing with fixed amount of water and 2% concentration of citric acid, lemon and orange juice. Thus, in practice, the above results are considered to be valid only if 10% of water or 2% of citric acid, lemon and orange juice were used to dilute aspirin.

To conclude, consuming up to 100 ml of water 2 hours prior to elective surgical procedures is not associated with significant risk of aspiration syndromes. The effect of the preoperative intake of clear fluids on gastric acidity and volume is not clinically significant. The above results are in line with several randomized controlled trials that have been conducted before."
217,"In conclusion, the study shows that a significant improvement in local control of locally advanced cervical cancer can be achieved by combining radiotherapy with hyperthermia (study #1). However, it is important to note that the combination of radiotherapy and hyperthermia did not result in a corresponding improvement in overall survival (study #1)
 
A multi-institutional clinical study on the use of hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy in patients with advanced deep-seated tumours in multiple organs demonstrated success with lung, stomach, liver, urinary bladder and rectal tumours, with CR and PR rates being significant in 54% of cases. CR and PR rates were particularly impressive for lung cancer at 80% (study #3).
 
Though not assessed in the same way in all studies, no severe adverse events were observed in all study groups with combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia treatment. Side-effects in the form of pain during treatment and burns occurred in 21% of participants after a combination of radiotherapy and hyperthermia (study #4). 
 
It's important to note that while VHF microwave therapy combined with external beam radiation did not result in increased therapeutic advantage in controlling locally recurrent rectal cancer in this study (study #4), the lack of improved therapeutic response may be due to inadequate radiation doses being used. As such, VHF microwaves may still offer benefits in conjunction with more advanced radiotherapy techniques. 
 
Combining preoperative radiation with endocavitary hyperthermia (870 MHz microwave therapy) may represent a viable treatment option for rectal cancer, as demonstrated by increased survival rates both at 5 years and for patients with stage 3 tumours (58.8% survival at 5 years) than in those just treated with external beam radiation (39.1% survival) or surgery alone (22.2% survival) .
However, a larger study population or a longer follow-up period is needed for a more definitive conclusion regarding the potential benefits of combining endocavitary hyperthermia with preoperative radiation therapy in the treatment of rectal cancer. 
 
In summary, the combination of radiotherapy with hyperthermia for the treatment"
218,"1. Breast feeding after cleft lip repair is safe. All infants who were randomised to continue breast feeding after surgery were able to do so without wound complications.
2. The study group of 40 infants showed improvement in suckling in 85% of the infants by day 6 of surgery compared with the control group.
3. The improvement in suckling in the study group was accompanied by a mean weight gain of 2.1 and 6.2% in the first two weeks after surgery for those continuing with breast feeding and spoon feeding respectively.
4. The mean weight gain at 42 days after surgery in the study group was 12.9% and in the control group 8.1% (P < 0.01).
5. The mean weight gain at six weeks after surgery for breast feeding infants was 17.3% and for infants continuing with spoon feeding at 18.8% (P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend that with adequate counselling, babies with repaired cleft lip can be managed by early postoperative breast feeding. Adequate hydration of the baby, careful examination of the baby's mouth after surgery and the use of soft-type rubber nipples are of crucial importance to prevent wound dehiscence."
219,"Overall, the available literature suggests that Artisan lens implantation and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are effective, stable, and reasonably safe for the correction of myopia between -9.00 and -19.50 diopters. Both procedures improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, with a significant improvement in visual acuity in the Artisan lens group. However, the Artisan lens provided better quality of vision, as indicated by the lower enhancement rate, exchangeability, better uncorrected and spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity, which led to a higher patient satisfaction compared with LASIK. Although both procedures are effective in terms of visual rehabilitation, there was no statistical difference between the two groups, which means that the Artisan lens is not superior to LASIK in reducing the mean spherical equivalent refraction or achieving a stable refractive correction.

In patients with moderate to high myopia, Artisan lens implantation and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) exhibited comparable outcomes in terms of safety and efficacy. Both treatments were equally successful in improving the visual quality of participants, as indicated by increased contrast sensitivity, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), and uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) compared before surgery. Nevertheless, the TICL group demonstrated better prediction accuracy and stability than the PRK group at all postoperative time points. Additionally, the change in BSCVA and UCVA in the TICL group was significantly higher at 6 months, suggesting that the TICL group experienced better visual improvement than the PRK group.

The comparison of LASIK and Artisan lens implantation for the treatment of moderate to high myopia (1-year follow-up) indicated that both options led to improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. However, LASIK produced worse outcomes regarding visual acuity predictability and safety, highlighting the importance of individual patient factors and surgical decision-making. In patients with moderate to high myopia, both LASIK and Artisan lens implantation yielded similar results in terms of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Nevertheless, Artisan lens implantation proved to be safer and more predictable than LASIK, leading to an overall better quality of vision"

221,"There are a number of clinical trials that have been conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of penfluridol in various clinical settings. These trials have examined the use of penfluridol in acute psychosis, chronic schizophrenia, and maintenance therapy. In all of the trials, penfluridol demonstrated comparable efficacy to other medications on the market, such as fluphenazine, while also having a lower incidence of side effects. These findings suggest that penfluridol may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.

However, it is important to note that these findings are based on a limited number of studies, and additional research is needed to fully understand the impact of penfluridol on patient outcomes. Research suggests that the use of penfluridol in clinical trials provides valuable information about its effectiveness and safety, but more studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of this medication. Overall, the clinical trial data available on penfluridol suggests that it may be a promising treatment option for patients with schizophrenia. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of this medication on patient outcomes."
222,"To summarize the findings in these studies:

1. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) with one of the following: cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline appeared to be equally effective and well-tolerated for treatment of severe melioidosis. 

2. The recommended duration of total antibiotic treatment for severe melioidosis is 12-20 weeks. 

3. There was a trend toward better survival in the case of severe sepsis with suspected melioidosis  (i.e., those patients receiving G-CSF treatment) but there were no significant differences in survival between the treatment groups, suggesting the potential benefit of G-CSF in patients with severe sepsis. 

4. Azithromycin plus ciprofloxacin might be an alternative maintenance treatment for melioidosis, but larger randomized trials are needed to test this.

Overall, these studies provided valuable insights and guidance for clinicians in the management of melioidosis, although further research is still needed to optimize treatment outcomes for this potentially life-threatening disease. By applying the key principles and findings of these studies, clinicians can develop effective treatment strategies and provide appropriate care for patients affected by melioidosis.

223,"Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), which commonly presents in primary care, has often been treated with antibiotics. However, with the recent increasing rate of antibiotic resistance among the causative bacteria, antibiotic-prescribing patterns for ARS and cost-effectiveness analyses of antibiotics are needed to reduce the risk of ARS infection. Antibiotic therapy has been questioned among general practitioners (GPs), and ARS guidelines have been adapted accordingly. Nevertheless, in many countries, antibiotics remain first-line therapy in ARS practice. While 40% of patients with the common cold recover spontaneously, approximately 90% of patients will recover regardless of the treatment provided. Some patients with mild or moderate ARS will heal in the absence of antibiotic drugs within a few days. However, certain patients with ARS will require more active management. The evidence regarding antibiotic use for ARS is inconclusive and is highly disputed. The current guideline suggests that antibiotics should be prescribed for the management of symptomatic ARS. Since the use of antibiotics alone does not guarantee a cure for most patients with mild or moderate ARS, the combination of antibiotic therapy with topical nasal steroids may be considered as the initial treatment approach. The clinical efficacy of antibiotic-based therapy is still controversial. Some guidelines have recommended antibiotics only for patients with moderate or severe ARS. This recommendation was derived from a limited number of studies of antibiotic therapy in ARS, often with short follow-ups.

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to determine clinical efficacy outcomes of antibiotic therapy for ARS. One meta-analysis evaluated 30 RCT studies, which included 3696 adult patients, and revealed no significant clinical benefit for patients receiving antibiotics. However, this meta-analysis had severe flaws, with small sample sizes and poor quality of studies. A further meta-analysis, which included a larger patient sample size (n = 1252), also showed that antibiotics were of little benefit in patients with acute uncomplicated ARS. Most of the studies investigating the efficacy of antibiotics in ARS recruited patients at clinics with predetermined criteria and the majority of patients may have been immunocompromised because"
224,"After analyzing study abstracts, it is evident that polyethylene glycol and lactulose are effective osmotic laxatives in treating chronic constipation, with polyethylene glycol having an added benefit of being prebiotic in some cases. The lactulose group reported better efficacy and ease of disimpaction in the open-label phase, which can be attributed to polyethylene glycol's higher dose in the treatment of constipation.

In terms of efficacy, polyethylene glycol was more effective in reducing colonic fermentation and increasing stool frequency. However, lactulose was more effective in promoting faecal consistency and decreasing hard stools. There were no significant differences in the frequency or consistency of stools between the two groups. Additionally, stool consistency and ease of defecation were both improved significantly after treatment in both experimental groups compared with control.

Adverse effects were also reported, with abdominal pain being the most common symptom in the lactulose group. Both treatments were tolerated well, but polyethylene glycol produced more ""nonhard"" stools than the placebo control and exhibited higher complete remission rates of constipation.

In conclusion, polyethylene glycol 3350/electrolyte solution seems to be an effective and tolerable treatment for chronic constipation but more studies are needed to compare its efficacy to lactulose and to elucidate its dose-response.

Abstract 1: Abstract:
Background: Lactulose increases stool frequency (1), defecation frequency and ease of defecation (2), and is safe (3). Colonic fermentation produces gas and increases stool bulk. Lactulose consumption can reduce gas production and increase stool bulk (4). Polyethylene glycol 3350 is a nonabsorbable osmotic agent used for cleansing the bowel. This study determined the clinical efficacy and tolerance of oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350/electrolyte solution versus lactulose for the relief of methadone-induced constipation.

225,"To determine whether a significant difference exists in efficacy and in incidence of side-effects in 28 children with night enuresis treated with placebo in one sequence and with imipramine 25 mg in another sequence.  The response was assessed in terms of number of dry nights per week, after 5 and 7 weeks of treatment, and number of days when no pad is used, after 5, 7, and 9 weeks of treatment.  At each of these points, the dry night response to imipramine was compared with the no-treatment response to placebo.  No significant difference was found between imipramine 25 mg and placebo in the efficacy of treatment.  Of the 28 children treated by imipramine 25 mg, 12 developed side effects, compared with 8 of the 28 children treated by placebo (chi square = 4.12; P less than.05).  All subjects had been carefully evaluated prior to selection for participation in this study.  The results would appear to confirm the reports that imipramine is not effective in the treatment of night enuresis..

Study #33: [An open non-random controlled study of enuresis treated by imipramine or metformin].. 82 patients treated for 8 weeks with imipramine (n = 33), metformin (n = 32) and placebo (n = 17) were enrolled in this study. Before and after use of medication, urinary parameters were examined. A post-treatment reduction from baseline values was found in the total number of wet nights when the subjects received imipramine or metformin. The average number of dry nights when using metformin or imipramine alone was more than the number with placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant. Dosage of metformin 15-60 mg/day appeared to be as good as dosage of imipramine 75-100 mg/day to control enuresis. Side effects were seen more frequently in the imipramine group than in the metformin group..

227,"Background
Human African trypanosomiasis caused by T b gambiense is a fatal disease for which available treatments are very toxic. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy for second-stage disease compared with standard eflornithine monotherapy.

Methods
Design and participants
This study was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, active control, phase III, non-inferiority trial done at four HAT treatment centres (Atsimo-Atsinanana, Fianarantsoa, Mbinda, and Molegbe) in the Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The trial protocol was approved by the Congolese Ministry of Public Health with the assistance of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; Paris) staff and the Institutional Review Boards of MSF (Dutch section; Amsterdam) and MSF International (Geneva). Patients aged 15 years or older were eligible if they had confirmed second-stage T b gambiense trypanosomiasis. Confirmation of trypanosomiasis was made by any of the following tests: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid dipstick technique, or lumbar puncture with trypanosome culture.

Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eflornithine monotherapy or eflornithine-nifurtimox combination therapy for a total of 3 weeks. Randomisation was performed centrally by computer-generated randomisation sequence by MSF staff. The random allocation sequence, a list of concealed treatment allocations, was generated by the Clinical Trials Research Unit of Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit and Unit, based in Oxford, UK. Stratification by site was done. A block randomisation sequence was produced within each stratum, using varying block sizes. Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing allocation information were kept at each site by the clinical trials staff. Randomisation was done by using the sealed envelopes.

Procedures
Each patient was hospitalised at the start of the study and remained so until discharge. Patients were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence by MSF staff. Blood"

Methods: At 22 sites in Japan, 176 patients in Stage III non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg/m2 of cisplatin 1 h before the first radiotherapy session, followed once every 3 weeks by 40 mg/m2 of cisplatin 1 h before the second and sixth sessions (arm A, n = 87), and 64 Gy of fractionated radiotherapy (64 Gy was administered in 32 fractions; 2 Gy was given 5 times a week), or radiotherapy alone at a fractionated dose of 64 Gy.
Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. There was a significant improvement in tumor response with the addition of cisplatin to radiotherapy; tumor response rates were 31.0% and 50.6% for patients who were given radiotherapy alone and radiotherapy plus cisplatin, respectively (P = 0.0003). Median survival after 3 years was 11.5 months for patients who received radiotherapy alone and 17.4 months for those who received radiotherapy plus cisplatin, with P = 0.0005. The frequency of loco-regional progression in patients who received radiotherapy plus cisplatin was 68.0%, compared with 85.9% among those who received radiotherapy alone. The improvement in the frequency of loco-regional progression was not significant at arm level (P = 0.34), but a statistical difference was found among the patients who underwent whole- or half-lung radiation, that is, those who received 64 Gy or less (P = 0.018).

231,"The purpose of this study was to test an innovative approach to smoking cessation that might be particularly attractive to adolescent smokers.  We conducted a longitudinal study that was a participatory research effort between academic and school partners.  The intervention used an Internet-based, virtual reality world combined with motivational interviewing conducted in real-time by a smoking cessation counselor. Partiicipants were 136 adolescent smokers recruited from high schools randomized to the experimental or control condition.  Those who participated in the program were significantly more likely than controls to report at the immediate post-intervention assessment that they had abstained from smoking during the past week, smoked fewer days in the past week, smoked fewer cigarettes in the past week, and considered themselves a former smoke.  Only the number of times quit was statistically significant at a one-year follow-up assessment.  The lack of longer-term results is discussed, as are methodological challenges in conducting a cluster-randomized smoking cessation study.

The first study examined the effectiveness of a brief intervention (bi) versus a brief office intervention (boi) and found that 30-day, point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates were significantly better than the brief intervention by month 24 (post intervention). The second study evaluated the efficacy of Not on Tobacco in Florida: an overview of program successes in changing teen smoking behavior. The first experimental study was an 8-session cognitive behavioral program that included a boi and homework assignments, with a 6% quit rate. The second experimental study was a 2-year efficacy study of the American Lung Association's teen smoking cessation program, the Not on Tobacco (NOT) program. The primary outcome measures were carbon monoxide-validated quit and reduction rates for not and bupropion versus the standard. Group skills training sessions were conducted each week by research staff. Abstinence rates at Week 10 were 23% versus 28% and significantly better by month 26.

Study #28: Microbiological safety of 2 antiseptic products for the treatment of the umbilical cord in premature infants: a comparative prospective trial 1


Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The aim of our study was the comparative evaluation of the treatment efficacy and safety of the umbilical cord in premature infants by means of 2 different antiseptic products: Triple Dye (TD) and salicylic sugar powder (SS) and 2 different types of controls (dry cord, water). Cord length was shortened in the SS group by 2.4 days (p= 0.006); there was a significantly higher number of cord changes in the TD and water groups than in the SS group. We observed sporadic cases of infection. Infection-free infants, colonization was more frequent and more heterogeneous in the water group; the rate of negative cultures was significantly lower in the SS group (87% and 84% respectively, p= 0.001). Two newborns died, but none of the deaths or infections were directly related to their cord-care regimen.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Study design A prospective, comparative, randomized study was conducted on the treatment of UCs in 200 premature infants (<32 weeks of gestation) after their transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit or neonatal special care unit. Two different cord-care regimens were randomly assigned by the use of computer-generated random numbers."
233,"7 papers were summarized, representing the findings of different studies on improving mobility and preventing secondary complications in older adults or older adults living with stroke. These papers suggest that community-based group exercise programs, physiotherapy intervention, task-related circuit training, and task-orientated interventions may improve some of the secondary complications resulting from immobility and physical inactivity in older adults. However, it should be noted that the conclusions drawn from these studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of randomization, and lack of blinding. Future research should be conducted to replicate these findings with larger sample sizes and better study designs. Overall, the evidence suggests that there are potential interventions that can improve mobility and prevent secondary complications in older adults, but further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these interventions.."
234,"The literature on comparison between stenting and coronary bypass grafting is ambiguous, as there have been both positive and negative findings. We were particularly interested in a subgroup study of the single vessel, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The study included a total of 2,759 patients with coronary artery disease and randomized 450 participants to undergo either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent implantation.
The outcomes in both PTCA stenting and coronary bypass grafting with the exception of 10% increased risk of subsequent angioplasty by 2500 procedures. Similarly, another study compared stenting versus coronary artery bypass grafting and also found that coronary artery bypass grafting was beneficial when compared to stent implantation alone which resulted in lower need for a repeat revascularization.
Lastly, another study compared 30-day and one-year follow-up results between stenting and coronary bypass grafting in patients with multivessel disease. Similarly, the study findings resembled the previous two studies and found that stenting resulted in lower major adverse events than did coronary bypass grafting. Furthermore, this study also found that stenting was associated with 2-4% reduced survival, 6-8% increase in subsequent myocardial infarction, and 6-12% increased repeat revascularization requirement, when compared to coronary bypass grafting.
In conclusion, although coronary bypass grafting is associated with a greater risk of myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization procedure, the overall survival is nearly the same. However, the survival following stent placement is relatively lower and thus, coronary bypass grafting is the preferred treatment for a majority of the cases who meet the recommended criteria, such as multivessel disease.

1. Corticosteroids were found to be significantly effective in preventing post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).
2. Carbamazepine was effective in treating facial pain in five out of 12 patients, while nortriptyline was effective in treating diabetic neuropathy.
3. Tizanidine was well-tolerated but not as effective as carbamazepine in the management of trigeminal neuralgia.
4. There was no difference in the efficacy of nortriptyline-fluphenazine (NF) and carbamazepine (CMZ) in the symptomatic therapy of diabetic neuropathy (DPN).
5. The use of carbamazepine (CBZ) and clomipramine was comparable in reducing the severity of pain and paresthesia in patients with DPN.
6. Nortriptyline was effective in relieving pain caused by peripheral diabetic neuropathy.
7. Carbamazepine had limited effectiveness in reducing pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.
8. Amitriptyline was effective in relieving pain caused by central post-stroke pain (CPSP), but there was no correlation between effect and plasma concentration.
9. Tocainide was considered a promising alternative to carbamazepine (CBZ) for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), due to its similar efficacy and better tolerability.
10. Pimozide was found to be more effective than carbamazepine (CBZ) in treating trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and its therapeutic benefits were observed even during the maintenance period."

Study Summary: 
A standard treatment for pregnant women with seizures is with magnesium sulfate. A clinical trial was carried out to confirm the results of a number of smaller studies and determine the risks and benefits, or efficacy of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy. There were no differences in seizure related outcomes, the primary outcome of the trial. Although, death or severe brain damage due to an seizure was also decreased with magnesium sulfate.

Study Design: 
The primary analysis was for those patients who had received magnesium sulfate and therefore were in the treatment group. The trial was a randomized double blind trial with the participants being randomly assigned to receive either placebo or magnesium sulfate.

Detailed Description: 
Approximately 5 million pregnant women a year have convulsions in the UK, with the majority of women surviving the initial seizure. Pregnant women who have seizures are at risk for repeat seizures which can be fatal. The standard treatment for convulsions is with magnesium sulfate which reduces the risk of subsequent seizures, while also reducing the risk of dying due to the seizures. However, there was little agreement in the medical community regarding the appropriate dosage, the necessary duration of therapy and the optimal way to deliver the therapy.

237,"The studies in this review examine the effect of interventions on neurodevelopmental outcomes of very low birth weight preterm infants. There is no single intervention or treatment that is effective for all children with developmental and behavioral problems. Rather, many treatments and therapies that target the specific needs of children exist. 
The studies vary in the type of intervention, when the interventions are applied, and how outcomes are defined and measured. As a result, it is difficult to make direct comparisons across studies. Some studies use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, which is considered the gold standard in evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention; they can determine whether the outcome is a result of the intervention or would have occurred without the intervention. Other studies do not use an RCT design because of the challenges of recruiting and maintaining participants in clinical trials, particularly of low birthweight infants and their families. In these studies, a pre-post design is used in which the same group of individuals is exposed to the intervention before and after the intervention. This design is weaker than an RCT design because it provides less evidence that an intervention can improve health outcomes in a given population. 
In the RCT studies, the results of the intervention are mixed. Two studies find no significant differences in cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes of infants at 2 and 4 years of age compared to control groups. A third study finds that, at 2 years of age, intervention group infants scored more highly on measures of mental development, motor development, and the number of stimulations received. A fourth study finds no significant differences in cognitive or motor outcomes of infants at 2 years of age, but it finds a significant reduction in parenting stress. An additional study finds that, at 2 years of age, intervention group infants gained more weight than control group infants. 
In the non-RCT studies, the results are less consistent than in the RCT studies. Some studies find that early interventions improve infants' mental and motor development, while a few other studies find no significant differences. One study finds that early intervention improves cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes of infants at 4 months of age, and a few other studies find that early interventions improve infants' parent-infant interactions. 
Overall, these studies provide some support for the effectiveness of early interventions in improving developmental outcomes of preterm infants. However"

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common, age-dependent condition in men older than 50 years of age, affecting an estimated 3% of the US population [1]. When prostatic hyperplasia causes symptoms, pharmaceutical therapy, such as alpha blockade and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, is often effective for the relief of symptoms, such as storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and voiding dysfunction [2]. Untreated benign prostatic hyperplasia may progress to urinary tract symptoms requiring intervention [3]. Surgery is typically recommended for men with symptomatic progressive benign prostatic hyperplasia who fail medical therapy or have refractory urinary tract symptoms. Currently, the most common surgical procedure for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia, and the subsequent urinary tract symptoms, is the transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) [1]. Although typically effective at relieving LUTS, TURP surgery is associated with several side effects. Incontinence and urinary tract symptoms frequently persist after surgery, which can seriously impact a patient’s quality of life (QoL) [4–7].

Pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs) have been shown to be effective in reducing urinary incontinence. A recently published meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of P"

Study #20: The effect of varenicline on mood disturbance in a smoking cessation group: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms.. Depression is a risk factor for smoking and impedes quitting, but smoking cessation pharmacotherapies rarely address depressive symptoms. This study evaluated the effect of 12-week varenicline treatment in terms of severity of depression and anxiety.
Secondary data included self-reported mood symptoms, which included: depressed mood (depression), feeling tense or keyed up (anxiety), difficulty concentrating (attention), feeling slowed down (psychomotor retardation), change (aggravation/improvement) in sleep disturbance (sleep), and change (aggravation/improvement) in energy levels (fatigue).
The effect of varenicline on mood symptoms was assessed at baseline as well as during the first and third week of the 12 week therapy. The study showed that there was a slight improvement in mood symptoms during the 1st and 3rd week of therapy but the difference within groups was not significant. No significant difference in any parameter between varenicline and placebo was observed.
Varenicline, a partial‐agonist of the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype, was found to have a good safety profile in general, with no significant change in mood disturbance.

•	In a study of sulindac in patients with a history of adenomatous polyposis, sulindac was associated with almost complete or complete regression of rectal polyps in 11 of 12 patients.
•	In a placebo-controlled trial of sulindac to prevent adenomas, there was no difference in the number or size of polyps between groups.

Additionally, data on the duration of catheterization will be collected to determine if catheterization contributes to the development of UTI. 
Data from all patients will be maintained in confidence. The names of patients and/or identifiable information will not be shared or published as an individual or as a group. All data will be reported in terms of the number of patients who demonstrate each outcome. 
Protocols 
Inclusion Criteria 
All patients scheduled to undergo TURP for BPH will be considered for enrollment in the study. Patients must agree to participate in the trial and be able to follow study-related instructions. To ensure that eligible patients have fully informed consent, each protocol will be accompanied by a consent-to-treat (CTT) form. CTT forms for each patient will be kept in the patient’s medical record. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Patients who are ineligible for the surgery or who are at increased risk because of previous TURP or bladder diverticulum will be excluded from the study.
