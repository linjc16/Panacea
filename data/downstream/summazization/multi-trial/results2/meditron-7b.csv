0,"[/INST] Restore Total Function of Central Venous Catheters Occluded by Thrombus and Fibrinous Sleeves.. 8 .

#### Background

Navigating patients through the healthcare system and providing expert management of the cancer patient’s care is a great challenge.  For some patients, central venous catheters (tunneled or non-tunneled) are necessary for administration of chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or hemodialysis.  Unfortunately, as the catheters age and the number of uses increases, complications can be caused by catheter obstruction from fibrin sleeves, blood clots, and/or thrombus.  Treatment using fibrin sheath injections and infusions of heparin and/or urokinase have been useful.  Restoration to patency and prevention of reobstruction frequently require repeated procedures and may become complicated when the catheter is buried deeply in adipose tissue or encapsulated by fibrotic tissue.  Additionally, recalcitrant fibrin sleeves and catheter-tip thrombi can be difficult to treat, and the reopening is frequently only temporary.  A more permanent means of catheter preservation should become available.

The use of fibrin sheath injections with urokinase has been proven to successfully open occluded catheters.  Many patients do not tolerate prolonged infusions of urokinase due to pain, bleeding complications, and the development of serum sickness.  To eliminate pain and the risk of bleeding complications, very low doses of urokinase have been suggested by several investigators (Table 8-1).  Although the number of cases published is small and long-term results are not known to be effective in opening more heavily fibrinized catheters, low dosing of urokinase has been shown to reopen 90% of catheters.  The use of localized fibrin sheath injections or low-dose infusions of urokinase, either alone or in combination with heparin, has not been studied sufficiently to support recommendations as a routine regimen for all patients. Fibrin sheath injections may be an option for"

5,"[/INST] The article from Dr. K.T.B. Brownson & al. is an excellent and well-written study. The problem itself, is an important one, the way it is designed and performed is elegant, and the data are convincing - especially compared to a lot of the junk around published with only a cursory glance.
                But, the problem is so important, and so much of a problem, that I feel these conclusions are not fully supported by the results. Too many things of significance to the results are left out of the analysis - and, not explained away in the results section. To my mind, the results are not clearly explained or analyzed to get to the conclusions. But for the limitations discussed ahead, the article is excellent. I would suggest a follow-up study with the limitations listed addressed, then the article can be published.


### Methods section
#### Trial design

> You've spent a considerable amount of time getting this perfect: why dilute it unnecessarily with additional data sets that are not crucial?
Your methods section is long, but it has much to describe on what is a very significant study. The trial design section is clear and well explained.
The randomisation section describes an ideal but rare scenario - and the details needed for the randomization are there. The blinding section is not clear, but seems to me as if it wasn't necessary to the analysis.

The primary and secondary endpoints are clear and as it should be (well argued, well supported by the current practice).

#### Study procedures:
> In my assessment, the most important aspect of this study is the study procedures section.

> This section should be more clear and detailed. It is a trial of the use of adjuvant AV-fistula. So I could not imagine the use of ""traditional"" femorocrural PTFE bypass. If so, it seems inappropriate/poor technique. If not, the use of an AV-fistula in a surgery without AV-fistula would be unethical. I think an uncommon and important combination of procedures (but, why so?)
> I'm curious if this is a one of a kind surgery, since it doesn't seem to be a study of the adjuvant AV-fistula per se. This could lead to a study of the best technique"
6,"[/INST] When conducting a synthesis, you should strive to present a comprehensive, unbiased synthesis of the literature as opposed to providing only one side of the story. It is also noteworthy for the reviewer that studies were included that were conducted over 10 years ago, when the drugs were less widely used. That suggests that the generalizability of this synthesis to other studies in this era of antibiotics is limited, and that it has historical value for a review of the body of evidence as a whole. The role of health care professionals in reducing disparities for families in poverty.
There are an estimated three million children living in poverty, and they are at far higher risk for a variety of health issues than their middle class and wealthy peers. This article reviews the research on early childhood health outcomes for children in poverty, presents data on health insurance coverage among low-income children, and examines how early childhood health programs and pediatric practitioners have the most leverage in mitigating the health disparities experienced by low-income children. The relationship between the duration of antipsychotic treatment and the improvement of negative symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale in schizophrenia
This study investigated whether the longer antipsychotic treatment is associated with greater improvement in negative symptoms. Data were collected from patients with schizophrenia who were 300.05 million won; β = 0.11, p < 0.05). Our findings suggested that schizophrenia patients who had been treated with antipsychotics for a longer period of time showed more improvement in their negative symptoms. Longer duration of antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered in patients with negative symptoms if positive symptoms are well controlled.

Study #14: Haloperidol plasma levels and clinical effects. Comparison of a fixed dose with a pharmacologically optimum dose.. The authors investigated whether a fixed dose of haloperidol would be more clinically effective than a dose of haloperidol titrated to attain a level of 18 ng per milliliter in the circulating plasma.
                Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia were entered into a randomized prospective study of two dosages of haloperidol. One group of 16 patients was treated in a double-blind fashion using a haloperidol regimen of 15 mg twice daily, the other group of 16 patients was treated using an adjusted dosage regimen in which the dosage was modified to 15 mg twice daily (target of  18 ng per milliliter) to provide a target haloperidol plasma level. Both groups also received routine neuroleptic medications during the study. They were evaluated at 12 weeks and 24 weeks by an examiner who was not clinically involved in their care.
                The haloperidol dose and adverse effects did not differ between the two dosing regimens. Two clinical measures, the positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale for neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, differed significantly in favor of the haloperidol dosage set to 15 mg twice daily (target of  15 ng per milliliter) rather than that set to achieve 18 ng per milliliter.
                A significant level of extrapyramidal symptoms in schizophrenic patients was more readily attained using a targeted dosage of haloperidol of 15 rather than 18 ng per milliliter.
                The authors suggest that a 15- to 16-mg haloperidol dosage regimen, adjusted to produce a high but clinically optimum plasma level, may be a more effective method of maintaining schizophrenic patients in clinical remission than a fixed dosage.

This article discusses the challenges associated with clinical presentation/diagnosis and therapeutic options for influenza in children and adults, including those with asthma. Reccomendations: [INST] Readers should consider the following recommendations: Diagnose influenza with PCR, as it is a sensitive and highly specific test that is less affected by antiviral administration and treatment delays.
                In patients with asthma, a clinical syndrome similar to non-asthmatic patients may predominate, and laboratory testing is not mandatory.
                Treatment is recommended to reduce severity and duration of symptoms, and prevent severe outcomes, including death.
                Early initiation of antiviral treatment within 24 h of symptom onset reduces the development of complications, and is associated with increased antiviral efficacy. A higher risk of hospitalization is associated with delayed oseltamivir initiation. Use of antivirals should be considered according to the CDC recommendations. Currently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have limited coverage for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza; contact your local policy regulating agency for information regarding reimbursement guidelines.
                Influenza can exacerbate and trigger asthma.
                Avoid delaying or forgoing influenza vaccination. In patients with a history of asthma, the vaccine is usually well tolerated.

 Tetragonal zirconia polycrystals with ultrahigh strength and ferromagnetism

Tetragonal zirconia powder (ZrO 2 ) is transformed from an orthorhombic phase below 1100 °C and then transforms into a cubic phase above 1100 °C. However, only in a specific phase region has the highest strength been reported. Here, tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZPs, t-ZrO 2 ) with a single-phase composition of ZrO 2 (JCPDS no.371808) without obvious orthorhombic phase are prepared through solid-state reactions.

    Summary Conclusion: [INST] A system for summarizing the studies was designed and tested with 70+ abstracts containing clinical trial results and recommendations. Five out of 70 were mis-evaluated, giving a sensitivity of 97% for automatic text summarization and a sensitivity of 98% when a manual follow-up was added. In addition, the system's consistency on the human evaluations of the accuracy of its summaries was high (88%). The system is easily integrated into clinical trial databases where it can provide a text-based and automatic overview of clinical trial results.


# Introduction

The aim of this paper is to design a system capable of summarizing the studies of clinical trials automatically, and to test the summarizing performance of the system on actual clinical trial abstracts. The summaries are then compared with the ones written by human specialists, to analyze their consistency and ability to correctly identify the conclusions.


### Abstract

The clinical trials described in papers published in medical journals have important results and conclusions. With this in mind, systems capable of summarizing the results, recommendations, and conclusions of studies in a clinical trial are needed to quickly provide clinicians with the information they need.


# Methods

The first step we carried out was to develop a system capable of automatically summarizing clinical trials. We developed the system in four steps, namely: defining a model to abstract the clinical trial, detecting study phases using that model, extracting all study phases and their results, and selecting the best summary.

The clinical trials selected in the study were from the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) database. The documents were downloaded on the February 20, 2000. A total of 127 documents obtained in this search containing the keywords ""clinical trial"" and ""randomized"". Of those documents, 23 were about"

Recommendations for Synthesis: [INST]
Recommendation 4: Summarize the key study findings.

[/INST]


Synthesis #1:
We recommend performing a pancreaticoduodenectomy with a stented duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy rather than nonstented pancreaticojejunostomy to decrease the pancreatic fistula rate. The quality of evidence was moderate [4, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3; Grade B]

Synthesis #2:
We conditionally recommend performing a pancreaticoduodenectomy with a stented pancreaticojejunostomy rather than nonstented pancreaticojejunostomy to decrease the pancreatic fistula rate, because the benefit of reducing pancreatic fistula rate is outweighed by the high quality of evidence that the internal stent is not a risk for pancreatitis and the patients do not require adjustment to pancreatic fistula clinical pathway. The quality of evidence was high [4, 4, 4, 4, 5; Grade B]
Recommendations for a Pancreaticoduodenectomy With a Stented Pancreaticojejunostomy
When performing a pancreaticojejunostomy, the authors performed a randomized controlled trial and reported that the stented pancreaticojejunostomy reduced the leaking rate of pancreaticojejunostomy. We do not currently know the influence of the stent on the late-onset, obstructive pancreatic stenosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy. We need to assess long-term outcome and follow up the patients.
When performing a pancreaticojejunostomy, the pancreatic anastomosis technique is important to reduce the anastomosis leakage. The invagination method is reported to be the best method in comparison with the simple side-to-side method and the interrupted side-to-side method with a knot-tying technique. Because, by using invagination technique, a continuous suturing line is formed, anastomotic leakage is low. To use the invagination"

This post provides a great example of why I love writing abstracts and why writing is more than a mere means to an end.
You do this for a living, you do this daily, and every day you take knowledge and make knowledge and communicate knowledge. To make science effective it needs to go viral if you will, and so by nature science communication is the lifeblood of scientific research.
Most people are not scientists, and most people have no interest in learning about anything that does not directly involve them. They may feel the need to know about these studies, and in that same vein there is a great unserved need to improve science communication.
And this is where you come in. Science can save lives, and we need to improve our communication techniques. It’s not something that’s taught in our curriculum. And yet we need to do it.
This was very well done.
The challenge is that as we get good at it, they need to find a way to train scientists in how to do this.
Maybe one of you is a leader, or a boss of a scientist or an institute or whatever where you can help drive this kind of education and implementation. That’s my hope, and that’s my challenge.
So let’s just get to the meat. The core of this is we’re going to summarize the studies so that we actually understand it.
To do that means we’ve got to have an understanding of why we need to do this and what we need to summarize.
So first of all we know that most people don’t make it through a scientific article or a scientific report, especially if they’re not involved in the actual research.
What scientists do to solve this problem is we write an abstract. An abstract is the distilled version of the most crucial parts of what our paper really does, and it’s what most people who just stumble upon it don’t really understand, they’re reading it for the wrong reasons. And we’re going to see exactly how that goes wrong in a minute.
Okay, and then we’ll talk about how abstract really differs from normal communication for a second because there is a very important distinction here. Science communication often really involves technical communication, and sometimes technical communication goes completely incoherent with everything else.
So if we understand technical communication and the nature of how technical people talk"

The treatment of ADHD should be tailored individually for each patient. There are many options that are available but it has become very popular to treat ADHD with stimulant medications in the forms of methylphenidate products. If a patient is refractory to stimulants then treatment with atomoxetine, bupropion, and anti-depressants such as nortriptyline can be tried. There is also strong evidence showing a beneficial effect of clonidine for treatment of ADHD.

Study #12: Methotrexate  Clinical trial on effectiveness and adverse effects of methotrexate.. Methotrexate (MTX), a known anti-metabolite with anti-neoplastic properties, is currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis even in Japan. We conducted a clinical trial to examine its effectiveness and the incidence and intensity of adverse reactions in the drug application.
                Fifteen hospitalized outpatients diagnosed in accordance with the American Rheumatism Association's criteria were divided into two groups with normal renal function. The first group was administered MTX intramuscularly, 15 mg/week, and the second group was administered it intramuscularly, 10 mg/week. All patients received folic acid, 7 mg/day orally to prevent drug-induced adverse reactions. Treatment was continued for 3 months.
                In the patients treated with 10 mg of MTX per week, the articular pain index decreased significantly, while all other items showed improvement, though not a significant one. In the patients treated with 15 mg of MTX per week, the score for pain index decreased, and the skin and joint swelling scores decreased significantly. No patients developed serious adverse reactions to MTX. However, skin eruptions occurred in three, and leukopenia in two patients.
                These results indicate that MTX, even at low dose, is useful in controlling the articular pain and swelling, and that MTX can be given both to patients with normal renal function and to elderly patients with renal failure if they are given folic acid supplementarily.

                Summary: Spironolactone is a reasonable but imperfect antiproteinuric and BP lowering agent when added to ACE inhibitor/ AngII receptor blockade. Spironolactone is not renoprotective when compared to placebo as eGFR decline did not level off. The antiproteinuric effect of spironolactone largely correlates with the reduction in GFR. Patients with better preserved renal function and lower albuminuria have shown a somewhat higher reduction in albuminuria than patients with worse renal function and higher albuminuria. Albuminuria reduction on spironolactone largely relates to the reduction in GFR as urinary ACE levels declined proportionally more than in the placebo group. Spironit is thus associated with baseline ACE in diabbrevisual urinary ACE.

- Synbiotics for preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in very low-birth-weight infants
- Antioxidants for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage and respiratory distress syndrome

# How to optimize preterm infants# {#section5}

To help optimize an infant with an extremely low birthweight, the family should discuss with their neonatologist and use the following recommendations and resources.

### Precautions for newborns # {#section6}

Infants born before 37 weeks of gestation are at increased risk for numerous health concerns including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), anemia, hypoglycemia, intraventricular or periventricular haemorrhages (IPH), and jaundice.
If possible, fetal growth can be stopped, and they can be stabilized and transported to a facility with a NICU that can provide the neonate with the needed level of care.
Many preterm infants are too small for gestational age and their lungs are not ready for extrauterine breathing. They cannot regulate their temperature and lack the surfactant needed to minimize lung collapse, and therefore they are at risk of RDS. The most common treatment for RDS is ventilation (mechanical ventilation). Infants born very preterm without RDS may still require supplemental oxygen when they are started breathing spontaneously, and for them the treatment is usually oxygen delivered by nasal CPAP (nCPAP). Infants with RDS are more likely to die from the complications of their breathing problems.
Breast milk, or a supplemental human donor milk when mother's milk is unavailable, reduces morbidity and mortality"

The intervention seems to prevent approximately 14 lives from being lost for every 1,000 people treated (49  additional lives could be saved over 1,000 people treated with the alternate treatment). Clinical outcomes: There was no evidence of heterogeneity in this analysis (p=0.99). The test for overall effect was positive, indicating that the intervention is superior to the alternate treatment, with a number needed to treat of 14  to save or prevent one death (54  more lives could be saved with the intervention than with the alternate treatment). Safety: There was no significant heterogeneity (p=0.70) for the pooled safety outcome of major bleeding. Overall, patients in the intervention group were less likely to experience an adverse event (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89; I 2 =6%; 2,319 patients). Cost-effectiveness: The intervention costs about $4,230 (2008 Canadian dollars) less to administer than the alternate treatment, while the alternate treatment costs about $153,665 more to deliver. When considering quality-adjusted life years, the intervention costs about $18,430 (2009 Canadian dollars) more per QALY than the alternate treatment.

Instructions




Answers must be organized within the body of the essay, or in a format such as footnotes or endnotes. If you wish to refer to a footnote or endnote within your text, you may do so by mentioning the page number followed by a dash (-) and the appropriate superscripted letter.

If you need to break up the text in order to more clearly explain or discuss a point, you can do so using paragraphing, headings, diagrams, and/or boxing (in which case the outside lines of the box should not touch existing content).



**Instructions and Examples for the Instrument/Task List**









**The Task List should be in the form of a simple list** which shows the student’s abilities:
1. What students should know.2. What students should be able to do.3. Statements that make this learning clear for students and their instructors, and describe the level of expectation.The Task List is a simple and clear description of what students will be able to do on completion of the study using the materials provided. The Task List describes the expectations of an expert student. It is a description of the level of achievement the student should expect of himself/herself.


**A typical Task List contains 25-30 items, with one learning objective per line.** In addition, the Task List should include sub-goals that describe the subsections of the unit. For example:

- List 1: Assessment of current health

- List 2: Self-efficacy for healthy behaviors

- List 3: Social support for healthy activities

- List 4: Healthy dietary changes

- List 5: Relaxation and stress management

- List 6: Health problems that can be addressed with positive behavior changes"

38,"[/INST] This is a single, rather long, review article with multiple summaries (each summary is a paragraph) that has a general overview and specifics to each study (see the individual summaries for specifics).

This summary is based on the findings of the 3 primary studies.
Comments: The summary contains no insights from the reader. There is significant detail and, unfortunately, the reader is completely dependent on the summary to understand what happened in each of the studies.

A number of errors have occurred during the extraction of data from the text of the included studies (e.g., some of the data contained in the summary has no mention in the included studies).


# Conclusion:?[SOLVENDOT]
The reader can reach their own conclusions about whether preemptive analgesia is beneficial.

The reader of  is able to understand the studies, reach their own conclusions, and make suggestions for new studies. I would suggest that the title of the study be changed to ""The Effectiveness of Preoperative Analgesia in the Decrease of Postextraction Pain"" since the studies did not include other oral or preoperative procedures. Also, the conclusion should be worded something like ""The preliminary investigations do not reveal that preemptive administration of an analgesic prior to oral or preoperative procedures decreases the level of pain associated with postoperative procedures in children.""

The authors did a fantastic job of noting the limitations of the study at the end of the article.

Study 7 should be in an Endnote format.

Study #6: Comparison of the analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and placebo administration on postextraction pain in children.. This randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy of the preoperative administration of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and placebo administered 1 hour before and 6 hours after unilateral upper second premolar extraction in reducing postextraction pain in pediatric patients. Sixty patients aged 5 to 12 years were selected to participate in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 pretreatment drug groups.

43,"[/INST] I found myself constantly switching between reading the papers and writing in the notebook. This is mainly due to the fact that the papers often included a section called “discuss this” or something similar; I would then find myself taking notes of the points that I thought were important and then switching back to the original paper to read it all again.
            I have organized this summary into two sections; one which looks at all aspects of the trial and one which looks at the findings of the research. I did not use the notebook in the first instance to organise the trial into sections, as all of them followed roughly the same pattern and I did not find them particularly helpful. It was more useful to concentrate on the actual details from each paper. I have tried to give a good summary of the study but to be honest it is difficult when the detail was sometimes somewhat lacking in many areas.
       I would like to make one last note before I leave this summary. Throughout my training I have experienced that writing research summaries is a valuable tool. It improves my research skills such as being able to critically appraise data or, as I experienced when summarising my own research results, being able to compare and contrast different studies. It is a skill that should be taught to all healthcare students, from undergraduate students or junior doctors but should not be limited to trainee doctors. Instead it should be seen as a lifelong skill that enables a critical view on all literature on a particular topic. If you need assistance with your writing, come and see me!!! I am happy to offer assistance and guidance.

 Pleiotropic Effects of Lrp5 on Post-Natal Growth and Dentition.
The skeletal patterning signaling via the LR(low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) receptor and the Wnt canonical signaling pathway is one of the major pathways controlling mesoderm differentiation and body pattern formation during early embryogenesis. Previous work has shown that LRP5, the ligand-binding subunit of the LR receptor plays an indispensable role in the proper development of the skull. To examine the role of Lrp5 in post-natal growth and dentition, we performed inhibitory protein knockdown experiments in vivo using LRP5-antagomirs. In these experiments, we evaluated the effects of suppressed expression of Lrp5 on body and dental development. We found that administration to Lrp5 antagomirs at post-natal period in mice induced reduction in the weight gain accompanied with a decrease in mandible size and the amount of the dentin along the amelodentinal junction. In addition, mice receiving Lrp5 antagomirs exhibited delayed tooth replacement in the mandible and excess elongation of incisors. Molecular analysis using a luciferase reporter assay showed that Lrp5 expression in dental mesenchymal cells increased the sensitivity of these cells to the Wnt signal"

### Summary of Findings

 2. [INTEGR] Analyze, identify themes and synthesize the key findings of each paper into a single summary. This is an integrative summary; a high-level summary. If you wish, make an oral summary of the findings from these papers as you would for a patient.

 1. 2. 3. 4.

 2. [PURPOSE] After conducting the analyses and synthesis, compare the key findings of the studies in the summary boxes. Are the study findings consistent across the studies?

    - Do at least two studies support each major conclusion?
    - Is there any evidence in the data or reporting of the study that indicates that some conclusions should be questioned?
    - If so, consider why the author reached a particular conclusion. Could the study method have been better? The results not reported?
        The paper could be a summary with selective reporting that is only reporting major findings.

51,"[/INST] Over a period of 7 years, we collected data on 191 patients. 157 eyes were treated with a patch and 34 without. We used a multivariate regression model to analyze the combined effects of factors (e.g., type of wound, patching) on the rate of healing. Our findings indicate the following conclusions:
                • There is no significant difference in speed of healing between nonpatched corneas and patched corneas.
                • There is no difference between nonpatched and patched corneas in the percentage of patients requiring pain medication during the first 24 hours.
                • There is no significant difference in the speed of healing between simple dendritic corneal injuries and superficial corneal lacerations.
                • There is no significant difference in the speed of healing between simple stab corneal lacerations and corneal lacerations with a foreign body.
                • Corneal defects associated with corneal foreign bodies are more likely to heal by first day.
                • Corneal laceration size is not a significant predictor as to the rate of healing.
                By combining information from more than 100 corneal lacerations, we were able to come to more reliable and statistically significant conclusions than were possible using data acquired from a single patient, group of patients, or a pilot study. This method is of particular importance in clinical research when it is not possible to examine the outcomes of each patient individually.

                                The findings of the aforementioned study of epithelial healing are contradicted by a prospective randomized clinical trial published by Vargas et al in 2003 in the Archives of Ophthalmology.  These investigators evaluated 52 patients with corneal abrasions that were randomly assigned to either the patch or no-patch group. Patched patients wore the patch for the first 24 hours postinjury. Both groups were compared with regard to pain, discomfort, patient activity, number of pain medications needed, and number of hours needed to achieve 95% reepithelialization. The results revealed that the no-patch"

Study #1: [/OPEN]{S1}Transcutaneous oxygen pressure as predictive parameter for ulcer healing in endstage vascular patients treated with spinal cord stimulation. [/INST]Abstract A randomized-controlled study with one year follow-up was made in 86 Fontaine stage IV patients with endstage peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) undergoing 21 day intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy for nonhealing ulcers.
                All patients had arteriosclerosis, 13 also diabetes mellitus. Entry criteria included: non-reconstructible PAOD as proven by intra-arterial angiography or patient condition, ankle systolic pressure < 50 mmHg, severe rest pain despite analgetic medication, and presence of nonhealing foot ulcers or dry gangrene. One week after the start of PGE1 therapy, patients were randomized into receiving SCS plus PGE1 (n = 45 patients), or just PGE1 (n = 41 patients). Follow-up examinations were done at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. BASELINE: There were no significant differences between both groups in the following: age, sex distribution, ischemic skin lesions, risk factors and several key group mean physiological values including ankle systolic pressure, ankle/brachial ratio (ABI) and foot TcPO2. The SCS group had more prior vascular leg surgeries (1.77 vs 1.58 per patient).

54,"[/INST] The results of the studies described in the manuscript provide a snapshot into the current level of evidence-based decision-making among physicians. While a single trial was designed to measure if healthcare providers would use systematic reviews to inform their clinical decision-making, several other trials were conducted to determine if knowledge-brokering methods or the dissemination of systematic reviews would enable physicians to provide care based on rigorous evidence in their clinical settings. These trials were conducted in a variety of medical settings, but the outcome results were the same, none of these interventions could be shown to change the provider’s practice.

We conclude that knowledge-brokering may be essential in improving clinical decisions and subsequently quality of patient care in the future. However, more research is needed to find out what aspects of knowledge brokering are more effective and how to implement these concepts with varying healthcare settings.

# Results: [/INST] As described in the Methods section, ten trials were identified with a range of medical specialties being represented. In all studies, the trials followed a pre-post test design, thus there was no randomization of subjects to control group and intervention arms. The clinical outcomes explored were quite diverse. The trials were evaluated based on a combination of the methods that were developed by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Medical Research Council (see Appendix D).

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the impact of two dimensional echocardiographic and left ventricular myocardial performance index (LV-MPI) on determining the severity of heart failure and prognosis value.



METHODS
Two hundred fifty patients with heart failure were divided into NYHA I (60 cases), NYHA II (59 cases), NYHA III (63 cases) and NYHA IV (28 cases) groups according to their NYHA cardiac function level. And 79 normal people were chosen as the normal control group. In order to assess their cardiac function of patients in heart failure, two dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler tissue (DTI) were conducted. And the impacts of LV-MPI on determining the severity of heart failure and prognosis value were analyzed.

##### CURRICULUM VITAE MARK SCHULZE



After completing my PhD and finishing my postdoctoral study, I started to work with Professor Dr. J. Peter de Jager at the School of Dentistry, Aston University.

My main interest was to find the underlying cause of pain in tooth-colored restorative materials, more specifically silorane-based composite materials and polyacid-modified resin composites.

I investigated this with two different sets of experiments — with different types of dental bacteria and with patients.

Before leaving Aston to take my current position at the Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam (ACTA), I decided to take advantage of the opportunities offered at this university and started my career as a university teacher.

From 2007 until 2010, I have been a full-time teacher and head of a course in Operative Dentistry at the Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam.

In 2010, I became a guest lecturer at the Academic Center"

Study #5: Headaches in tension-type headache are modulated by EMG biofeedback.

Study #1: Increased heart rate variability and decreased blood pressure in patients with tension-type headache during biofeedback training.

Laboratory-based randomized controlled studies investigating the effectiveness of EMG biofeedback in the treatment of tension-type headache are limited. We sought to determine whether changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure (BP) can be used as biological markers in studies of pain control associated with EMG biofeedback training..

A double-blinded, single-center, randomized, controlled study was conducted. Twenty-three female patients with tension-type headache and 21 healthy controls were evaluated in a quiet experimental room between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. with the subjects sitting after 30 minutes of rest. During the experiment, HRV was collected in the intervention (biofeedback) and control groups and in the control group, blood pressure was measured. A total of 10-minute resting periods were followed by a 5-minute run-in training for all of the subjects in the control and intervention groups. The intervention group received EMG biofeedback, and HRV was evaluated. The controls received no feedback training. The data were statistically analyzed..

There was a significant increase in HRV in the intervention group (P = .02), while there was no significant change in HRV in the controls (P = .82). Between-group comparisons revealed significant differences among the groups in terms of root mean square of successive differences in R-R intervals ("

-[3] Does it present the results clearly and explain them? Include how the methods were used, and how the results where reached
-[4] Is it clear that all sources of bias have not been eliminated (i.e. whether the results have an alternative cause)
-[5] Does the paper use the most scientific methods? (Does it use the most appropriate analysis method? For example, do statistics have been used where appropriate and have the other methods been checked to see what they showed in terms of data.)
-[6] Does the paper use appropriate controls or experiments to support its conclusions?
-[7] Does the paper consider the strength of its results? Is it backed by enough evidence?
-[8] Does the paper present and discuss all its results in terms of possible causality or the limitations presented in the results?
-[9] Does the study provide a clear conclusion which indicates the direction the results are taking?
-[10] Was the paper written well for the reader to understand in the end?
-[11] Does the paper contain valuable and useful information for research?
-[12] Is this paper a significant publication?
-[13] Does the paper help to create a new or novel body of knowledge? What is its importance in"

65,"[/INST] There are 8 studies in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. There is conflicting data on the effectiveness of ACTH in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.  (1) ACTH had a good effect even in children that had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome with normal cognition.  Another study found that it did not make a significant difference in the children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.

The EEG in children with these types of seizures may look a lot different from  one another.  Some are hypsarrhythmia, whereas others are generalized slowing with sharp waves, or they can be focal slowing.  All of these EEGs would be defined as Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome .   The typical patient presents with drop attacks, atonic seizures, and epileptic sleep or atypical absences.  Diseases that commonly present with drop attacks include Lafora's disease, EPM1, Lafora-like disease as well as others.  Drop attacks are seen in Lafora's disease and EPM1 because of the hypersynchronous neuronal death in the thalamus.  The drop attacks seen in these conditions of hypersynchronous thalamic neurodegeneration is similar to those seen in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and thus often poses a big diagnostic/therapeutic dilemma.  When a child is diagnosed as Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome , Lafora's disease or EPM1 then the next question is about which intervention. Disease intervention for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and the like includes therapy directed at reducing the epileptic tendency and preventing tau pathology.  Pharmacotherapy for EPM1 and Lafora's disease is aimed at slowing the progression of thalamic as well as neurodegeneration.

Through its properties such as low friction, low fracture resistance, high yield strength and ductility, nickel titanium has found wide use in the orthodontics. Super-elastic alloys are one of the groups of innovative materials that are finding promising applications in the field of dentistry. They can be manufactured as wires, bands, springs, brackets, and superelastic titanium, nickel titanium, and titanium alloys. The elastic properties of nickel titanium are based on the phenomenon of the reverse phase transformation (from martensite to austenite). The superelasticity is very close to that of austenite. In the superelastic phase titanium 80 percent and nickel titanium, 20 percent. For the super-elastic phase the austenite has been found in the superelastic archwire titanium 75 percent and nickel titanium, 25 percent. Due to the chemical properties of the super-elastic wires the body has found low tensile strength in the super-elastic alloy. The alloys (15%, 20%, and 25%) have the same properties such as low deformation temperature and high yield. The nickel titanium alloys have three dimensional.

Elevated Plasma Levels of IL-18 and IL-6 in Patients With Severe Sepsis and Their Influence on TNF-α Secretion and Prognosis
Despite recent clinical advancements in therapies for severe sepsis, prognosis still remains limited. Biological markers for in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis have not been clearly defined. Previously, we showed that high plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-18 are correlated with the mortality of patients with severe sepsis. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the correlations among IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α in these patients, and to clarify the role of these cytokines in the development of severe sepsis. We examined the plasma levels of IL-6, IL-18, and C-reactive protein as an index of infection, and compared the plasma levels of each of these cytokines between survivors and non-survivors (n = 44). Using these cytokine levels, we then calculated the ratios of the levels of IL-6 : IL-18, IL-18 : TNF-α, and IL-6 : TNF-α in all patients; for each cytokine pairs, we calculated the ratios in survivors, and examined the relationships between clinical variables and ratios. We found that plasma levels of IL-6 : IL-18 was 15.17 ±"

1. The number of daily applications required for a toothpaste and dental chewing gum to maintain a plasma fluoride level sufficient for the prevention of dental caries is the same.
2. An ingestion of 1.6 mg fluoride is necessary for the prevention of dental caries, 1 mg is sufficient for caries prevention during the first years of life.
3. To prevent dental caries, it is necessary to ingest a small amount of fluoride every day (3-5 mg F/kg/day) and additional applications are needed periodically.
4. A toothpaste and a dental chewing gum containing an equimolar concentration of fluoride maintaining an equivalent plasma fluoride level is more suitable for daily use than one using a different concentration of fluoride.
5. The recommended fluoride concentration in a toothpaste to prevent dental caries is 1,000 ppm F, and the daily application should be at least twice a day in order to increase the plasma fluoride level to a level of 5.0 /tmol/1.
6. The recommended fluoride concentration in a dental chewing gum is 1,000 ppm F. Gum chewing lasting over a half hour can be considered a single application.. nan.

- The highest effect was stated at proximal surfaces.
- Three-year studies demonstrated that a single treatment of Duraphat did not reduce caries occurrence after 1 or 2 years, but that repeated treatment with Durapath on a regular basis resulted in a significant and clinically important reduction of caries incidence even after 24 months.. A meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials by Pollick and Cochran showed that dental sealants reduce caries incidence and prevalence by 60-70% during the first 4 years, but the efficacy of sealants after this period is unclear.
        The aim of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the effect of sealants on the incidence of caries beyond the first 4 years.
          Two reviewers performed a systematic search and assessed studies for eligibility. Inclusion of studies in the analysis was based on predetermined criteria for randomised clinical trials (RCTs), comparative cohort studies (CCS), split-mouth and cross-over designs. Three RCTs and four CCS studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of the outcome measures were obtained using random-effects modelling. Pooled and weighted event rates of all groups were compared using risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
        The analysis showed that in studies applying sealants on all four first permanent molars (FPMs), the overall RD for decayed, missing and filled (DMF) surfaces was 0.43 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.60), 0.48 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.91) for DMFT and 0.27 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.45) for DMFS after 4 years. The effect was somewhat smaller when the sealants were applied on fissured only surfaces, with a RD of 0.01 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.43), for DMFT, 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.41) for DMFT and a RD of -0.06 (95%"

[/SUMMARY]
 Role of the immune system along the different stages of atherosclerosis development and the clinical implications
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. In the endothelial lining of large arteries, the blood components including oxide‐LDL, antiphospholipid antibodies, activated platelets, C‐reactive protein, antiphospholipid antibodies, monocytes, and lymphocytes, all trigger inflammation, and accelerate the pathological process. The activation of all types of immune cells (T cells, monocyte–macrophages, dendritic cells) and cytokine production (TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, TGF‐β) are also involved. The accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the intima with their deposition and oxidation gives rise to the release of fatty acids, a well‐known TLR4 ligands, that trigger the expression and secretion of TNF‐α by adipose tissue macrophages and adipocytes. This leads to a vicious circle. It is well appreciated that during vascular inflammation or atherosclerosis, all arms of the immune system participate. There is much less known about how T lymphocytes, mainly the CD4+ and the CD8+ subsets, play a role in atherosclerosis development. However, the presence of specific T lymphocytes subpopulations in the atherosclerosis tissues suggests their potential pathological involvement. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the immune pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is of utmost importance to define novel drugs. Finally, the potential role of the immune system along the different stages of atherosclerosis development is also of crucial importance. J. Cell. Physiol. 208: 99–110, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

[INST] Previous studies have demonstrated that adherence to antiretroviral drugs is difficult, and methods to increase adherence are needed. We tested the impact of supportive telephone calls in an adherence substudy of a treatment trial. Subjects initiating antiretroviral therapy received supportive telephone calls or usual adherence support during the first 96 weeks of therapy. During the first period of the main clinical trial participants were receiving one of 4 antiretroviral treatment regimens (3-drug vs 4-drug vs 3-drug + nelfinavir). We compared 45 subjects in the experimental group and 44 in the control group.

1. Results demonstrated that overall, >72% of subjects reported > or =95% self-adherence. 1. Supportive telephone calls had no significant effect on decreasing the risk for virologic failure or raising adherence (P values for the difference in the rate of failure between the study groups ranged from .49 to .98, P values for differences in adherence <.27.) 1. Independent predictors of higher rates of virologic failure at week 24 were <95% self-adherence, receiving a 3-drug regimen or the 4-drug regimen + nelfinavir, and being female. 1. Independent predictors of increased adherence at week 24 were being older, receiving a 3-drug regimen, reporting fewer stressors, reporting fewer barriers to care, and completing > or =75% of all telephone calls. 1. Additional research should clarify how telephone calls may improve other antiretroviral outcomes (CD4 cell count, HIV reservoir) and explore how the most beneficial telephone intervention might be targeted for HIV seropositives with particular barriers to care. 1. Results suggest that supportive telephone calls may mitigate the effect of lower adherence and virologic failure. 1. It is unknown if greater benefit would have occurred if the calls had begun from the time of HIV diagnosis. 1. It is also unknown how important it may be to tailor this intervention"

- Most patients benefit from metformin treatment in terms of insulin resistance.

# Strength:
- Systematic research of patients receiving metformin improves insulin resistance.

# Cons - Metformin is not superior to placebo because of the non-placebo controlled study design.

# Strength:
Conclusion: Patients with PCOS are less insulin resistant than those without PCOS.
- Patients with PCOS suffer from a higher insulin resistance than those without PCOS.
- Metformin is the first choice treatment in non-obese women with PCOS and hyper-insulinemia.

# Strength:
Conclusion: PCOS as a heterogenous disorder not only needs personalized treatment but also personalized treatment strategies.

# Analysis
- PCOS is heterogeneity with a wide range of different pathogenic factors.
- Phenotype has to be defined in each patient with PCOS.
- Clinically each patient will need an individual management strategy.
- Individualized treatment strategies should cover the phenotypes of each patient..

# Limitation
- Pooled meta-analysis from selected trials is weak.
- Only few patients underwent intragonadal treatment.
- Metformin treatment was not in all patients compared to patients not treated with metformin. The meta-analysis of these 9 studies was not possible.

As the researcher, I wish to investigate how well the support group would work for nonsmokers, smokers, and people struggling with severe mental health conditions who are willing to support their loved ones. For this purpose, I shall utilize the framework to address three research questions posed by the existing research. It shall also incorporate two hypotheses with reference to the interconnectedness among the studied individuals. The research questions relate to whether an individual is associated with other individuals that smoke or with non-smokers based on the support provided to the patient. The second hypothesis asserts that the social support from the patient's loved ones does not contribute to smoking cessation. The hypothesis of this study would be supported by proving that the patients who received the intervention showed little or no increase in smoking cessation rates when compared to those who did not receive support.

Besides, the researcher shall establish the relationship between the support from smoking or non-smokers and the patients' success in smoking cessation, and how well the smokers are associated with one another.

The study's goals are to understand the factors that influence the smoking rates of people with severe mental health conditions and the ways in which mental health factors impact the ability of the smokers from the public health care system's outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. The study shall incorporate social network data, clinically relevant smoking cessation, as well as mental health data.

94,"[/INST] The key findings from the provided study abstracts can be summarized as follows.
EMLA appears to increase the number of ulcers for which a complete clean would be possible with fewer cleansing sessions, as well as reducing pain from cleansing. Use of EMLA is equally beneficial, however, this is not always true. Further research is needed to help elucidate why this isn't the case at other times.
Analgesics are known to lower the level of granulation tissue, and can also delay wound healing. In EMLAs patients, no significant reduction in granulation tissue growth was seen while a significant reduction of granulation tissue is observed in placebo patients. This suggests, that while EMLA reduces pain associated with cleansing, the use of EMLA during the cleansing process does not interfere with healing or granulation tissue growth.
EMLA appears to be safe and the same effect of pain reduction during cleansing is seen from one treatment session to another.
The effect of EMLA on the number of days before EMLA is no longer necessary to be reapplied should be analyzed for each ulcer site, as it's clear that EMLA is not needed for prolonged periods of time in some cases. In some cases, the need for EMLA may be related to location, and this is something that should be included as well.
It appears, from the reviewed study abstracts, that use of EMLA can lead to a more complete cleansing of the wounds with fewer cleansing sessions (less than those needed in the placebo patients), less pain associated with each cleansing session, as well as a reduced need for anesthesia during cleansing, all the while having no noticeable effect on the growth of granulation tissue or the cleansing of wounds.
Pain during cleaning of the wounds was noted in every patient, suggesting the pain may be caused by the cleansing agent or the ulcer itself. The pain can be caused by the cleansing agent or the ulcer itself.

 A comparison of two procedures for assessing the effect of noise on visual perception.
One of the most serious problems in assessing perceptual impairment is caused by background noise, but only two objective methods are available. A study was undertaken to investigate the suitabilities of these methods on three samples of people (children, adults, the visually impaired). The study involved the comparison of an existing method, an adaptation of the Snellen chart, and a novel technique using a touch-sensitive computer monitor and a laser pointer. The results show that the touch-sensitive method provided the greatest standard deviation and a lower mean and minimum distance of perception. The Snellen method was found to cause a less-than-optimal procedure of assessment.

After reading the four study abstracts, create a cohesive synthesis of the four studies:
              - Be clear, concise and use good grammar.
              - Don't copy the original abstracts.
              - Don't describe the findings, as if they are your own.
              - Combine the key findings from each study - rather than listing them separately.
              - Integrate the findings so there is coherence between the findings of each study. - Your summary should only be the summary. - Do not try to explain your summary.

Study Abstract #1: In patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who require disease-modifying therapy, interferon beta alone or in combination with simvastatin may be considered.
                Simvastatin as add-on therapy to interferon β-1a for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (SIMCOMBIN study): a placebo-controlled randomised phase IV trial
                Simvastatin 80 mg/day compared with placebo as add-on therapy to interferon beta 1a in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for 1-3 years.
                Randomised, controlled, multicentre, double-blind, parallelgroup
                Safety and effectiveness in patients with diagnosis of CIS; and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis without clinical evidence of progression. Participants were required to meet disease criteria, use approved doses of interferon beta, and be willing to use interferon beta for three additional years.
                Patient age was 18-50 years; mean age was 36 years, SD 8.5 years.
                Primary outcome measure was annual rate of documented relapses in patients on simvastatin plus interferon beta compared with placebo plus interferon beta. Annual relapse rate was established based on patient data on documented relapses. Time to first documented relapse was established using Kaplan-Mayer analysis with 20th percentile and median (95% CI) time.

104,"[/INST] MVA was an alternative that is well suited for use as a clinical procedure, which could have advantages both for the patient and the  health care system. In order to compare conventional VA and MVA in a Swedish setting, a randomized study was undertaken.
                Two hundred women requesting abortion in early pregnancy, gestational age less than 56 days, and choosing surgical termination, were randomized to VA or MVA. Main study outcome was frequency of complete abortion but also other variables were recorded.
                There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding background characteristics. Altogether 91 MVA and 88 VA operations were performed. There was no significant difference in frequency of complete abortion; two patients in each group subsequently needed re-curettage because of incomplete evacuation. No case of ongoing pregnancy occurred. Two patients in each group received treatment for endometritis. No other complications were recorded.
                This study indicates that MVA is effective in emptying the uterine cavity, on par with the standard vacuum aspiration. The rate of complications with MVA was on the same low level as with conventional VA..
 Comorbidity burden and treatment patterns in US veterans with multiple sclerosis
Background: The comorbidity burden of US veterans with multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been examined. In this single-center, retrospective, matched-cohort study, we examined differences in the comorbidity burden and treatment patterns between veterans with MS versus non-veteran MS patients. Methods: The study database was derived from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical records and included veteran MS patients and non-veteran MS patients. Demographics, comorbidities, comorbidity indices (Charlson, Elixhauser), diagnoses, and outcomes were extracted for up to 4 years of follow-up. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes between the veteran and non-veteran cohorts. Results: In total, 276 veteran MS patients and 2,816 non-veteran MS patients were included. After propensity score matching, 20 veteran MS patients and 296 non-v"

 Reactive Oxygen/Nitrogen Species and Their Roles in Plant Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Stress Resistance Engineering.
Plants have evolved several mechanisms for coping with oxidative stress caused by oxidative burst or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging signals. Under adverse environmental conditions, such as high light intensity, low temperature, drought, salt, high osmotic stress, mechanical damages or heavy metals, multiple pathways of plant resistance are triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species along with oxidative burst. As a highly destructive oxidant, hydrogen peroxide can cause irreversible DNA damage and protein denaturation, resulting in cell apoptosis or cell death. However, ROS are needed within strict levels to regulate programmed cell death for plant normal growth and stress tolerance. ROS are vital signaling molecules in the antagonistic regulation of auxin and cytokinin. Furthermore, a series of pathways are activated to counteract the oxidative damage caused by ROS, including antioxidant enzyme systems, ROS detoxifying ROS metabolism, ROS-related gene regulations as well as osmolyte accumulations. This review focuses on research progress of plant ROS production, signaling and scavenging in plant abiotic stress response. Bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease

## #01 - Introduction: Review of evidence and challenges of inpatient psychiatry
Inpatient psychiatry involves the treatment of patients with acute psychiatric emergencies often resulting from self-harm and suicide or from a major exacerbation of their illnesses. In addition to medications and psychotherapeutic interventions, treatments may include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and sleep deprivation. Patients often require hospitalization if they are physically dangerous to themselves or others, if they cannot get adequate help to care for themselves in the community, or if they do not have a safe place to sleep. In most parts of the world, general hospital emergency departments and general medical and surgical wards are responsible for patients requiring psychiatric care because there are no other specialized facilities. Patients admitted for other reasons may also be unintentionally exposed to the adverse effects of psychiatric medications, or may develop psychiatric illness during an inpatient stay, which might be exacerbated by stress or other factors. Affected patients might remain on hospital wards for months or years. These patients may be admitted to a psychiatric ward, in a mental health institution, or in general medical or surgical w"

No significant differences were found in olanzapine-treated patients compared with controls. Increases in weight were observed among risperidone and olanzapine groups.


## Conclusions and key findings: [inst]
The two systematic reviews and two clinical trials were useful studies to understand psychosis and behavior in persons with Alzheimer's disease. The systematic reviews were informative of existing psychopharmacological treatment options for the alleviation of psychosis and behavior in this population. The controlled trials provided information about the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic drugs for the target population.

## Implications: [inst]
In summary, the two systematic reviews demonstrated that the use of antipsychotic was supported by weak evidence. The results of the clinical trials could aid providers in determining the proper treatment for patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease. The potential use of antipsychotics should be carefully evaluated by clinicians and providers. The treatment plan must take into account the potential harm that will likely result from side effects associated with the use of anti-psychotics.

## Recommendations: [inst]
Psychotic features are not a primary feature of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, use of antipsychotics has relatively little benefit to patients. This is exemplified by several controlled trials showing that antipsychotics result in little to no improvement of psychosis and behavior associated with Alzheimer's disease. The presence of psychosis and behavior may be the result of comorbid conditions. Therefore, identifying and treating factors that may lead to the exacerbation of psychosis and behavior is appropriate for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This could include the use of antidepressants, benzodiazpeines, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, these classes of medications are also subject to side effects. Therefore, providers and clinicians should consider other nonpharmacological interventions when available. Other interventions that may be important considerations include:"

Study Abstracts: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and the Role of Free Radicals and Antioxidants. 

In a double-blind, cross-over trial, 10 patients with clinically confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were assigned either to 12 weeks of a 10 mg/day dose of deprenyl (Eldepryl) with 12 weeks of placebo treatment, and vice versa. One patient received a placebo from the beginning of the trial. Deprenyl treatment did not improve symptomatic or functional status on average, however, the 66/66 and the Basso/Bettie-Brewer scores of muscle strength during deprenyl treatment were 12% and 8% higher than the corresponding scores during placebo period. Mean platelet MAO-B activity and the concentration of homovanilic acid (an index of free radical damage to dopamine) in the plasma samples decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during deprenyl treatment, and rose significantly during the placebo phase (p < 0.05). It is concluded that deprenyl is not beneficial to ALS patients as a whole. However, deprenyl treatment slows the disease progression in individual ALS patients, but not in a statistically significant way, and improves both muscle strength and functional status as evidenced by some patients. The present study suggests the role of oxidative damage in ALS pathogenesis, and suggests also a possible role for deprenyl in ALS patients who respond in an individualized way.

### Overall Study Summary: [/EMPH/]

> > >

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a progestin and a GnRH agonist as treatment options for various forms of hirsutism. A variety of factors may influence the efficacy and safety of hirsutism treatments.

> > > <H3>Treatments may interact or be affected by variations in the dosage and duration. GnRH agonists were used as a short-acting contraceptive for all patients, and long-acting reversible contraceptives. Treatments were chosen to help reduce unwanted hormones and maintain the patients. To determine the effectiveness of hirsutism, the severity of hirsutism was measured.

The 55 of the 94 patients were randomly given a gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and the other 39 randomly given cyproterone acetate (CPA) as well as ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl E2 (Ovynon). There treatment courses were 3 months for both treatment groups.

> > >

The average Ferriman-Gallwey hair score (FGS) was 10.69 in the first GnRHa group and 10.07 in the second treatment group. FGS decreased dramatically and statistically significantly in both groups. The results were similar for both treatment groups.

> > >

The treatment did not have any adverse effects for the patients in the treatment courses for both groups. Both treatment courses did not have any adverse-effects. No patients discontinued treatment because of adverse-effect in both treatment groups.

The lack of supportive function and pain relief found with the use of semi-rigid orthoses in metatarsalgia and rheumatoid arthritis (13 trials total), compared with wearing unmodified shoe inserts or bare feet, is very promising, and is likely the result of the arch support that is provided by this orthosis when worn with supportive footwear.

# Key Conclusion:
Active management of labor is associated with substantial reductions in cesarean section rates relative to more traditional labor management or conventional care.

# Discussion

After reviewing the article I think the study can be divided into the following sections. Please note also the article cited during the above text discussing the role of amniotomy was found to be incorrect and was therefore removed to the above text in which the article should have been cited.

### Section 2:
Active management of labor: does it make a difference?
To evaluate whether active management of labor lowers cesarean section rates, shortens the length of labor, and overcomes any negative effects of epidural analgesia on nulliparous patients.
Patients who were undergoing active management of labor were diagnosed as being in labor on the basis of having painful palpable contractions accompanied by 80% cervical effacement, underwent early amniotomy, and were treated with high-dose oxytocin for failure to progress adequately in labor.
Active management of labor is associated with shorter labors and a reduced likelihood of cesarean delivery. A significant benefit can persist despite the use of postlabor epidural analgesia.
Summary: [/INST] Overall: active management of labor is associated with substantial reductions in cesarean section rates relative to more traditional labor management or conventional care.

In this case study, you will be writing a summary of the insights from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial. Your task is to synthesize the key findings from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary.[/PASI]
When you perform a critical summary that focuses only on the results of the trial and ignores the research question or objective of the study, what is it called? [/CAPS]
Certain summary types are most effective when structured into the following parts: [/PAPS]




For example, a structured paragraph summary could be organized as follows: Introduction (or preamble); Background (why the study was conducted); Methods (the study population and its profile, design); Results and Discussion (summary of salient results, comparison to previous research, and significance of the results); Conclusions (clinical relevance of the findings); and Limitations (of the study). [/PAPS]
Critical summaries are often presented as a table or flowchart due to limited space. Avoid creating a summary longer than 4-6 short paragraphs. It is important to synthesize the material to include the points that the author wanted to communicate. [/PAPS]
It is important to have an understanding of the elements within articles to help you to summarize. [/PAPS]
Some authors will simply note the major findings of the research in an abstract; however, other authors will note only the most significant or important results. You should be sure to identify both the major and minor findings in your summary. [/PAPS]
Each row within a table should represent a distinct and clearly labeled section of the paper, and the rows should be arranged in a logical order to present the content in a chronological fashion. [/PAPS]
A graphical abstract is a type of critical summary. These are often designed with a box or bar with short text for the title. [/PAPS]

This collection of studies and results represent some of the best data available at the time to make suggestions within the following key areas.

## Interpretation of data from 589 publications (from in-press to 2015-Jan-01, from PubMed search with the keywords 'dysthymic disorder', or 'dysthymia'):
Studies on treatments for dysthymia have relied on RCTs with antidepressants. However, the clinical evidence reviewed supports SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, duloxetine) and SNRIs (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine; sertraline, paroxetine, and venlafaxine may also be efficacious) as first-line medications for dysthymia. A major limitation is that the evidence for first line medications is mostly extrapolated from clinical trials for MDD. Thus, the efficacy of antidepressants is only supported by evidence from clinical trials with antidepressants administered in a flexible dose range (typical dosing recommendations of SSRI=20 mg/day; SNRI=150 mg/day) and up to 12 weeks (typical dosing recommendations of SSRI=40 mg/day for up to 12 weeks). It is uncertain whether the dosage of SSRIs or SNRIs in clinical trials can extend to a duration longer than 12 weeks. It is also uncertain whether the dosage in clinical trials can extend to a duration longer than 12 weeks, especially for patients with chronic dysthymia and major psychiatric comorbidity. In terms of side effect profile; compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine or sertraline may induce sexual dysfunction; desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine may cause cardiovascular side effects which is also an important consideration for patients with chronic and treatment-resistant dysthymia. It also appears that desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine demonstrate an important advantage over other drug classes, such as SSRIs, by inducing significant reductions"

 Antigenic Determinants of Fowl Adrenocortical Cytosolic Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I: Molecular Cloning, Sequencing, and Expression of Cytosolic Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I in Nonpoultry Species
The cytosolic carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), in addition to its well known biochemical activity, acts as the major membrane carboxyl terminus of intracellular carnitine transport system in steroidogenic tissues such as adrenal cortex. By use of an affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against chick adrenocortical CPT I, we investigated the distribution of CPT I in chicken peripheral tissues and tissues from various nonpoultry species. In chicken peripheral tissues, high levels and the same molecular mass of immunodetectable CPT I were observed in adrenal cortex, oviduct, ovary, and testis. The enzyme levels were significantly less in lung and in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, and no significant amount of CPT I was detectable in liver. In rabbit and mouse peripheral tissues, a high level of enzymatic activity was detected only in liver. The enzymatic activity was negligible in other tissues. In humans, significant amounts of CPT I were detectable in liver and in placenta. In pigs, immunodetectable CPT I was found mainly in liver and in"

We have presented a case study of the effectiveness of the meta-analysis method for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment regimes from a meta-analysis of clinical trials to provide guidelines for treating a patient. Our examples also introduce the medical practitioner to the methodology of the clinical trial and meta analysis.


# Introduction

Natural selection favors genetic variation, since only a few of these variants may prove adaptive. A gene in this role is referred to as a genetic polymorphism. A few gene variants can alter the structure and function of the protein encoded by the gene sequence. These polymorphisms can cause variation in susceptibility to disease; for example, in the sickle-cell anemia patient, an abnormal hemoglobin is less able to carry oxygen than normal hemoglobin. For many genetic polymorphisms, however, it is not clear which individuals harboring the variant alleles are more prone to disease. Thus, although the polymorphism itself is not associated with disease, many polymorphisms appear to have small effects on the risk of disease.

To evaluate the effectiveness of therapies for treating a disease, evidence is compiled from clinical trials where a group of subjects is randomly assigned to receive the test intervention or the control treatment. The test treatment can be a drug or an established treatment protocol. Clinical trial results represent the best available estimates of effectiveness of treatment. The effectiveness of a treatment relative to a control treatment is a measure of how much the mean outcome for the treatment group differs from the mean outcome for the control group. A measure that represents the overall efficacy of a treatment is the odds ratio, OR. The OR is the odds that a subject in the treatment group is more likely to be in the better outcome group than the odds that a subject in the untreated group is. Odds (and odds ratios) can be interpreted in the following terms: If there are n patients in each group, the odds of a subject in the treatment group being in the group of better outcome, relative to a subject in the group of worse outcome, is OR = n1/n2. If OR = 1.2, OR > 1, and OR < 1, then treatment is beneficial, harmful, or protective"

    1.1.1. Warfarin compared to direct oral anticoagulants in the primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism
- Warfarin's comparatives are NOACs, and they are better than warfarin due to fewer drug interactions, lack of over-anticoagulation, and less bleeding and mortality. It's still good because we have to balance bleeding complications and stroke risk.

 Pleiotropic Roles and Transcriptional Regulation of Carbonic Anhydrase Isoforms in Plant Response to Stress

Plant carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are widely present in plant cytosol, mitochondria, vacuoles, secretory pathway, chloroplasts, and extracellular spaces. Many CAs have a critical role in pH and bicarbonate balance in plant cells and are involved in important cellular processes under both normal and stress conditions.

[/URL] (6) Heroin dependency and withdrawal symptoms: a brief synthesis

The opioid antagonist naltrexone is sometimes used to treat symptoms of heroin dependence. In this article, I consider how naltrexone might affect withdrawal symptoms in users. The narcotic antagonists have been used in Russia and elsewhere for many years to treat withdrawal symptoms experienced as a result of physical dependence on the illicit drug heroin. The main withdrawal issues considered are craving and dysphoria.
There appears to be consensus of opinion about how naloxone (a pure opioid antagonist) effectively treats and prevents withdrawal from heroin; naltrexone's influence over withdrawal symptoms of heroin.
As the main naltrexone preparation used is 4,000 mg and is taken orally; it is reasonable to compare the two-hourly 50-mg intravenous doses of naloxone and naltrexone's effect on withdrawal. The short half-life of naltrexone 50 mg is about 600000mg 00 of heroin the naltre 36 hours the in heroin withdrawal symptoms the symptoms of heroin symptoms heroin analysis is not naltreports for treating symptomso and a analysis of the ous data on the drug doses’ effects of naltreasons found that 2,012 drug effects in 3 of the main symptoms (not for 33 and drug, it was an overdrug: There were not the dosage washeroin drug: The 506 the naltrexindependent heroin the effects and for an assess and withdrawal opioin nalt1gave opio use heroin use of the use of the withdrawal withdrawal heroin. 3 and the analysis has many studies as you opioinform the program of use: the study to analyze the following heroin/analysis oral program opiate heroin 4 young to 4 to maintaining an opio in you and 5"

  Table 1: Summary of Key Clinical Trial Findings for Study Question #4  
 Comparison of aerosolized and sprayed didecyldimethylammonium chloride treatment for biocontrol of aflatoxigenic fungi on naturally contaminated groundnut kernels in the field.
Three field experiments were conducted to compare the efficacy of aerosolized with sprayed didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDA; 10 g/liter of water) in controlling aflatoxigenic fungi on groundnut kernels under rainfed conditions at the University of Georgia's Tifton Research Farm, in Georgia, in 2010 and 2011, and at Kiboga, in Uganda, in 2012. Sprayed DDA (10 g/liter of water) reduced aflatoxin B(1) at harvest by >50% in all three trials. Results of three experiments demonstrated an overall 91.6% reduction in aflatoxin levels as compared with the control. For years, the reduction with the aerosol method was 88.7%, whereas the reduction in 2011 was only 81.9%. This difference was attributed to a difference in rainfall amount between years. Aerosol application was more uniformly coated on kernels, and as a result, aflatoxin reduction with aerosol was higher than with spray method. High-performance liquid column chromatography was used to confirm aflatoxin levels by measuring individual aflatoxin B(1) and total aflatoxins: B(1), G(1), B(2), G(2), and aflatoxin M(1) residues. All aflatoxin measurements were conducted at two locations-Kewaula Mycotoxin Research Facility and the University of Florida at Gainesville. In conclusion, aerosolized DDA application of this active ingredient should be included in integrated pest management (IPM) and control programs of aflatoxin"

It has been claimed that zalcitabine can cause severe hepatitis. Our analysis would suggest against this. As such, zidovudine with zalcitabine may be a good alternative to zidovudine monotherapy for patient with CD4 count 250 cells per milliliter or greater. Zidovudine with didanosine will lead to better outcome as it has been documented.

[Historical Summary] [/INST]
Zidovudine and zalcitabine have a synergistic action, with 10 mg plus 10 mg daily showing similar results to zidovudine alone with the dosage of 600 mg twice daily. Zidovudine with didanosine is also synergistic. Drug-drug interactions should be considered.

We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 2761 participants from four trials (3489 participants randomised; mean age 35 years) comparing antiretroviral drug monotherapy with combination antiretroviral drug therapy in HIV-infected adults. Two randomized trials that enrolled 359 participants showed comparative efficacy between zidovudine plus ddl and zidovudine monotherapy, the other two studies showed no difference. None of the four randomized trials showed any difference in toxicity. None of the four trials showed any difference in mortality between antiretroviral drug monotherapy and combination antiretroviral drug therapy. On basis of indirect comparison for viral suppression there was no demonstrable difference between zidovudine and zidovudine plus ddl. Patients randomized to a combination of zidovudine plus didanosine had significantly"

Retinol is an anti-oxidant that the cell uses in the repair of damaged DNA and also helps modulate apoptosis and cell differentiation (i.e. turning cells ON and OFF)
Retinamides are pro-drugs of retinamide that is converted into either Retinal or Retinoyl Palmitate inside the cells. While all are anti-oxidants, the Retinoyl Palmitate will not convert into Retinol as easily as Retinamide since it cannot be absorbed through the skin.
In the study by Kung et al, patients received 1.0% or 0.05% 4-HPR and showed greater than 50% improvement of basal cell hyperplasia when compared with the controls. However, no comparison between the effects of 0.1% or 0.25% was documented.
In summary, the ideal would be a topical retinamide that converted to Retinol while also being water soluble to allow better penetration and absorption through the cell wall barriers.


# Discussion
Retinoids are a group of chemically similar, naturally occurring compounds found widely in the plant kingdom, which have properties analogous to vitamin A. Retinoids appear to have the same physiological effects as retinoic acid, acting as morphogens in early development and helping to maintain epithelial tissue differentiation. Retinoids play a central role in many vital processes, including the maintenance of normal homeostasis of the skin, epithelium, and many other tissues. Retinoids are synthesized via a series of steps, beginning with biosynthesis and continuing through absorption, transport, metabolism, and effects on target tissues (1).
Retinol and the retinamides have long been associated with cellular differentiation and regression of preneoplastic and neoplastic tissue in the treatment of carcinogenesis. In the skin, the retinoids act to stimulate the differentiation of keratinocytes and to modify the keratin profile. Furthermore, they are anti-inflammatory agents, have profound effects on immune system function, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of melanoblasts-cells that ultimately form melanocy"

[Summary: Your summary should be two or three short sentences, synthesizing the relevant information from each abstract. Place any numbers or statistics after the information, and provide the reference at the end, if necessary. The summary should be complete, as much as possible. It should not simply explain in your own words what has already been said in the abstract, but it should be an authentic and informative summary of the information that helps understand what you did..



# Introduction
BACKGROUND.
[Introduction: The Introduction should synthesize the information provided in the articles with your findings. The introduction should explain to the reader what background information was already known about your topic, and why you are presenting the summary. Provide a one-sentence or two sentence conclusion for the articles that you summarize, indicating in what way your findings help expand that topic. Your background/introduction should be in first-person, and the information from the articles should be in third-person. You may not simply explain in your own words what has already been said in the abstract; this is a requirement of the review. However, you should provide relevant background and explain why the studies were performed (what had already been done in that particular area) and what was known about the subjects that were being studied.

CONTEXT.
[Context: When synthesizing the studies, you may add the context as it helps readers contextualize the studies if one knows that they had been performed. The context should be short and should indicate the relevance of the information. If the information is already obvious, you do not need to include the details. For example, if the studies were in adult males, you may include 'These studies reported that X and Y were associated with Z' instead of saying 'The study found that X was associated with Y' (This information is too obvious, since you are doing a summary of the study). If the studies are older than 5 years, you could mention that..

CONCLUSIVE STATEMENT/QUESTION.
[Conclusive statement/Question: You should not write a two-sentence synthesis of the studies you have read. Your statement should be, as much as possible, authentic to the information that has already been published. It should be the same format as in the original abstract. If you summarize your own words rather than the information included in the papers, you cannot claim that it is a summary"

Reviewer's Comments:
Institute for Health Research (IMIER): Summary (April 14)

Reviewer 3: As I mentioned in my earlier report, I thought the initial response was encouraging, but a revised version would be useful. In the revised report, the authors have added additional references. What appears to have been missed is some discussion of why the new method would be superior to the use of telephone advice without triage. The fact that many patients are asked ""is your problem urgent?"" (and perhaps are being asked it twice) would seem to point out a problem with the proposal.
Secondly, as I mentioned in my prior report, the idea of ""managing by omission"" can have implications. While it sounds as if nurse triage is the answer to this dilemma, it isn't clear to me how that is going to work. Would all telephone calls be managed by nurses? Is the idea that general practitioners would then call in to ""overrule"" the nurses' assessments? If this is the plan, how will that work?
Thirdly, it seems to me that a general statement like ""nurse triage is as effective as other services"" should be treated with more caution than the authors are implying. The references provided by the authors don't back up their statement (the only two reference I haven't yet checked is the one by Davenport from 1987).
If this revised version is accepted, I would want the authors to tone down the conclusions (without implying that they are untrue). In particular, I would want a stronger caveat than ""telephone triage can help address the problem of 'too many people seeking to access services urgently during the evening and weekends'."".

Reviewer 1: Further information on how the nurse triage system compares with other services. The authors say ""However, the study is based on a limited number of studies, all of which are small."" -why were they included but only listed in , were they looked at after looking at the abstracts for other articles? The references from the Dodd paper don't show that her paper is included. If this is the case, I would question the adequacy of the literature search. It sounds as"

### 1: Summary: [/INT]



### 8: Rationale: [/INT]
There is an assumption that increasing circulating folate levels could decrease the risk of folate-related health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, CVD, neural tube defects, cognitive impairment, and neuropathy. It is less clear that increasing circulating folate levels would decrease the risk of cognitive impairment, seizures, neuropathy, NTDs, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neural tube defects.
There is a need for consistent and reliable information on all health outcomes related to folates and folate fortification. Existing data on the association between folates and colorectal cancer and neural tube defects are particularly important. Some data on mental health outcomes, cognitive impairment, seizures, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and neural tube defects are also important. More data on all other outcomes are required.
Folate-status results in folate-sufficient individuals are not expected to change because of fortification. The effect of fortification on folate status in folate-sufficient individuals has not yet been evaluated. Data on folate-status in folate-deficient individuals are required to demonstrate whether fortification is needed to increase biochemically and clinically meaningful folate levels. It is necessary to assess the effect on folate status in folate-sufficient and folate-deficient individuals and to make comparisons to the levels achieved by supplementation and intake (intake of food folate, dietary fortification, and supplementation).
Fortification may negatively affect the acceptability of food sources of folate. The fortification of other vitamins (as occurred previously) has been associated with decreased acceptability, taste, and consumption of fortified foods. Increases in biochemical folate levels have only been shown to increase acceptability when the changes were in the micronutrient ranges or above. These findings may not apply to an increased folate status from food fortification.
Food sources of folate that have been evaluated through fortification include flour, corn masa,"

# Problem analysis
Aim and problem: [INST] We were challenged to create a visual summary that included key concepts found within selected study abstracts and integrated the findings into a cohesive statement. Our challenge extended beyond developing a visual text output but also required us to evaluate the impact of the key findings of the studies and their collective significance. We learned how to perform a task while critically reflecting on our approach and process throughout the analysis phase.
Pre-existing Knowledge: [INST] IUD Use has been shown to promote pelvic infection. There is some evidence that lower risk is associated with using doxycycline as a prophylactic. The data suggests that the overall incidence on febrile complications following prophylactic use is low.

Data Sources: [INST] Study Abstracts, The Internet, PubMed, Google, New York Times, Nature

Search Strategies: [INST] I searched by title, author and keyword. The following keywords were used: prophylaxis, infection, fever, pelvic inflammatory disease, IUD Contraception, prevention, randomized controlled trial, doxycycline, prevalence.

Inclusion Criteria: [INST] All IUD related abstracts that met all criteria were included for analysis.

Exclusion criteria: [INST] All non-IUD abstracts; data not based on an abstract (full text paper, book); non-English language.

165,"[/INST] Summary: These findings suggest  that evening primrose oil may be useful in relieving the symptoms of childhood atopic dermatitis by increasing the synthesis of anti-inflammatory gamma-linolenic acid. There may, however, be a need for a longer time period between doses of EPO for clinical response and more research is required to confirm the efficacy and safety of longer term daily treatment with EPO and to assess which patients are most likely to respond to the oil.
        It is important to remember that clinical symptoms might be present despite normal IgE immune markers and may not represent the true prevalence and sensitivity of IgE allergy in atopic dermatitis. Further investigations into the relationship between IgE abnormalities and symptom response to a diheta treatment might help to identify subgroups of patients who respond to diheta therapy.
        The fact that only eight of the 17 children in this study were able to stop using topical steroids during this short-term clinical trial, while 10 were still using it at trial completion after 12 weeks of treatment. The majority of patients were able to switch to less potent steroid creams after the 20 week trial period.

Study #13 Abstract: Treatment with dihomogamma-linolenic and gamma-linolenic acids in patients with eczema has been examined with a long-term, open, controlled pilot trial on 18 patients with atopic eczema (involving children and adults). The patients were treated with an oral liquid preparation of evening primrose oil rich in gamma-linolenic acid (260 mg/d) for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the treatment was continued using a capsule preparation three times daily for 17 weeks containing the same quantity of dihomogamma-"

We report a case of a 68‐year‐old woman with an extensive papulo‐nodular and ulcerative skin lesion localized on the left thigh, which had lasted for 8 years and which had failed to respond to topical therapy with potassium iodide. Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate that was positive by direct immunofluorescent staining for Leishman‐Donovan bodies. Culture on Novy‐MacNeal‐Nicolle (NNN) medium using in vitro cultivation revealed a growth of promastigotes of Leishmania, in addition, Leishmania species DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear rRNA genes. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). She was treated with intravenous sodium stibogluconate and had a long‐lasting clinical improvement. Masked hypertension in the elderly: a real entity?
Hypertension is a major risk factor for all-cause mortality, vascular disease and cardiovascular mortality.1

Many studies have confirmed that patients with masked hypertension (MHT), who are normotensive in the clinic but have high blood pressure (BP) at home and/or ambulatory monitoring, have a similar risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity to that of systolic blood pressure (SBP)-diastolic blood pressure (DBP)-matched patients with sustained hypertension and of patients with sustained hypertension who are treated with antihypertensive agents.2–5 There is, therefore, a strong rationale for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy in MHT after the exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension, a normal physical examination, renal and endocrine tests are normal with epididymal adiposity at least 1.5 times that of the normal body mass index range and with normal left ventricular (L"

171,"[/INST] In my opinion, in addition to summarizing the key research question, the body of research papers that is reviewed need to demonstrate at least some form of integration and synthesis with key findings to demonstrate that the reviewed evidence is useful for advancing the clinical trial related research question at hand. The first 2 summaries in this instance did not do a complete job. The authors have the chance to make the integration and synthesis explicit in the body of research papers, but instead this information is hidden in the abstract where the reader needs to look at each piece of evidence in isolation.
In other words, the summaries need to be organized in a way to guide interpretation for the purposes of a clinical trial.
For instance, in [/INST] study #4, where the author states (I'm paraphrasing), ""PEP was a better treatment, where we have [PEP], we got a better clinical trial."" For the purposes of an in-progress clinical trial to evaluate a novel device to clear excess viscid mucus secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis, the statement ""PEP was a better treatment"" is misleading because the outcome of interest would be the effectiveness of a device based on the proposed mechanism. The authors cannot compare the efficacy of a physical mechanism with an engineering-based approach.
[/DISCUSSION] The first two papers provide clear summaries of the studies but neither study actually provides a full summary and integration with other papers. The authors also did not address the impact of positive expiratory pressure breathing, alone and in combination with coughing, on mucus transport over the whole lung and in a peripheral lung region. This is important, because the clinical value of chest physiotherapy was related to its ability to enhance mucus clearance. Therefore, the reader needs to have a good understanding of the whole lung clearance (which requires consideration of the timing required to get to peripheral regions and the impact of positive pressure on lung clearance) in order to evaluate the impact of the experimental device that is being investigated. Another reason that a full description of the PEP breathing and its impact is important is to be able to properly describe when the device is used and how that use affects the outcome of interest. PEP in particular can change lung volumes, which would have a big impact on the clinical trial because a full description"

# Experimental results

## 7

Results of Study #9 indicate that CBT and psychoeducation reduce the probability of bipolar patients experiencing a depressive relapse, but not a manic relapse.

## 8

Results of Study #10 indicate that, compared to medication alone, CBT and medication are the most efficacious treatment approach to relieving the depression and mania symptoms.

## 9
The results suggest that psychoeducation for bipolar disorders reduces risk of recurrence, increases the probability that the patients will survive the 5-year follow-up and increases the duration of time to the next recurrence over the 5-year follow-up period.

## 10
Results of Study #11 indicate that people treated with psychoeducation experience improvements in anxiety levels, social functioning, employment, and satisfaction with general care.

## 11
Results of Study #12 show that psychoeducation helps to reduce the number of mood episodes and hospitalizations and the costs required to manage bipolar disorders.

# Conclusion

From these studies, we can conclude:

* 1. The 2008 systematic review of CBT for Bipolar Disorders revealed that CBT was shown to reduce depressive and manic symptoms and hospitalizations, and improve functioning and quality of life. CBT was also shown to reduce the risk of early relapse and improve recovery outcomes, social functioning, and anxiety. 2. Based upon the outcomes of these studies, it is reasonable to assume that CBT and psychoeducation may be equally efficacious in reducing the risk of relapse in individuals with Bipolar Disorders. However, Psychoeducation may be a more viable modality for Bipolar Disorder patients as evidenced by the reductions in mood episodes and hospitalizations.

## 3.
Psychoeducation may be the solution to prevent Bipolar Disorder's high recurrence rate. Given that patients with recurrent episodes of bipolar disorders may require more services and cost more, psychoeducation may"

However, the 40 patients enrolled in the randomized phase of the study represented a distinct subset of those who enrolled in the overall study. Therefore, only the results of the 40 patients who received G-CSF or placebo are reported here. The study found that the use of G-CSF significantly reduced total costs, duration of hospitalization, and number of febrile episodes and was most beneficial in patients who had lower systemic exposure to G-CSF upon initiation of G-CSF use. The use of G-CSF in patients with lower systemic exposure to G-CSF also correlated with a lower risk of relapse and improved overall EFS, although the study was not large enough to detect significant differences between the two randomized groups of patients. Unfortunately, these results did not persist during the long-term follow-up (mean, 5.5 years).
Results of a cost-effectiveness analyses of G-CSF treatment are presented. A sensitivity analysis is performed for parameters that have wide ranges in the estimates. Sensitivity is estimated considering the impact of the treatment parameter values to EFS, costs, and relapse-free survival in G-CSF patients:
EFS: 35% to 94%, Sensitivity to EFS in G-CSF patients of 0.1550 and 0.7125, resulting in minimum and maximum costs of $7131 (37,234) and -1022 (-7771) for each treated patient, maximum value of EFS was 0.94;
Total duration of hospitalization: 2 to 17, 2 to 108
Days of G-CSF treatment: <8 to >21, 1 to >19
Cost of G-CSF treatment: 33%, 14,894%
Sensitivity to EFS: 46% to 592%

Dose of G-CSF: 2.5 microgr/kg/d to 10 microgr/kg/d

174,"[/INST] Directionless and Non-Irrotational Lissajous Motion of a Tethered Microswimmer in a Viscous Fluid.
A wide range of biological and engineered swimmers have been studied for their movement in Newtonian fluids. However, the non-Newtonian effects on their motion as commonly present in soft biological tissues and synthetic polymers have not been systematically investigated, limiting our ability to build the fundamental knowledge base of biological swimmers. Here, we explore the dynamics of a soft microswimmer (30 μm × 30 μm) driven by a rotating magnetic field outside the inertial regime, for which we propose a modified version of the hydrodynamic model. In a weakly viscous Newtonian fluid, we describe analytically the swimming locomotion on lissajous-curves in 3 D space, characterized by unbounded swimming speeds, without being locked-in for either direction or periodically oscillating. These features reflect the distinctive features of soft-swimmers, such as the compliant structure, in comparison to traditional designs like a circular disk that require a periodic motion in order to be propelled. In a more viscous fluid closer to the elasticity length scale, we show that this trajectory may be modified into a sinusoidal mode resembling the behavior of rigid-shaped designs. Taken together, we show that, in soft microswimmers, the motion outside the inertial regime is more complex and unbounded than previously discussed. In addition, our results provide a basis for soft-swimmer engineering by revealing the effect of viscosity on non-Newtonian fluids. Identification of a novel antihistamine component in an effervescent mixture of an H1-agonist and an antihistamine drug.
An effervescent mixture had been reported to cause a contact lens case staining. Further investigation revealed the cause of the problem to be due to a unique chemical interaction between an H1-agonist and an antihistamine. At the same time, a novel antihistamine component was identified and developed by a bioisostere strategy to the contact lens case staining and the antihistamine drug. The newly developed antih"

Study Summary:
      The computer program provides the learner with a comprehensive array of information and skills related to the prevention of pregnancy, STDs, and HIV. One might call it a ""virtual STD/HIV clinic"" since the student, in effect, sits in front of a computer terminal in a private room for between forty and fifty minutes and interacts with the program through various on-screen activities - a highly interactive and ""real"" experience.
      In one activity, students learn about the transmission of STDs and the risk of acquiring them at different types of occasions. When students read a list of common activities, they rate the risk of acquiring STDs by using a five-point scale with a slider to indicate the risk. For those items rated relatively high on the five-point scale, students are taken to that item's ""focused"" page which provides a listing of the relevant STD(s), what to look for, what to tell a partner, what to tell a doctor, and what to do if infected. For those items rated relatively low, they are given a list of prevention recommendations, an example of the prevention practice, and an invitation to ""think about your experience"" where they are encouraged to ""think of a situation when I would be at risk of being infected (or infecting someone else)."" This is followed by two ""yes/no"" questions to ascertain whether they have ""ever been in this situation before"" and, if so, ""what I did in this situation"" and ""what prevention step(s) I took.""

1. You found a very large number of abstracts on Google Scholar. I presume that your institution provides resources to help you access and organize publications. If so, go for it. If not, use a list of publications and their citation information to track your research.

2. You want to select a small number of studies that align with your research question. In case something did not come up in the electronic search, review the studies selected by the authors.

3. A meta-analysis is more convincing than a literature review. But a randomized controlled trial is much better than a pooled meta analysis. The level of study provides a very objective source of comparison.

4. Be sure to have a complete understanding of the study design chosen to perform a review of reviews. To summarize and interpret existing research, a Cochrane review was chosen. It required a protocol, search, selection, data extraction, and analysis. The Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions is an excellent reference.

5. Avoid bias. It is easy and common to interpret the results you see. However, it is very difficult to see the biases in your work (unless you have a co-author check every step). And even when you avoid bias, the rest of the world, using meta-analyses, will be trying to do the same thing.

6. Your search yielded 23,000 articles. The only way to sift through that many is to first make sure that you are performing the search and that these results are appropriate.

## Your task is to summarize the results of the studies selected.
How well are you at the following actions? Rank: 1 (Best) to 7 (Worst).

# Discussion questions:
What does this person see that is missing from the description that you provided (see previous discussion)?
Provide constructive feedback to the person who provided the abstract description. If your answer is based on personal experience, say so.

## Conclusion

You found a lot of abstracts to analyze. It was a challenge to discern whether or not to include a study. A good summary of the meta-analysis is an essential step to performing a review of reviews.
The task of writing a summary from what you have performed is a great and important learning experience. A key step in"
182,"[/INST]The clinical task is to reconstruct the bone and soft tissue damaged by removing a tooth. The current gold standard in immediate implant placement is to use deproteinized bone mineral to replace the lost bone volume.[/DATA] In one systematic review, 3 prospective, randomized comparative clinical trials were identified that compared guided bone regeneration techniques in conjunction with immediate implant placement, which was always performed with a resorbable membrane. Although the review found no statistically significant differences between the submerged and non-submerged techniques investigated, it highlighted the need for further long-term comparative trials that used different regeneration strategies and implant designs.[/DATA] Clinical protocols require treatment to have a positive effect on the esthetic of the region. The goal of this prospective clinical trial was to evaluate the ability of simultaneous guided bone regeneration to optimize the results of immediate implant placement in the anterior maxillary region. Twenty-nine patients with at least 1 buccal bone defect (debt >2mm) were treated. The maxillary defect was filled with Bio-Oss with a resorbable collagen membrane. Bone and gingival levels were measured from the crest of the alveolar process. These values were compared 1–2 days and 9–12 months after insertion and rehabilitation.
Results:
Patients who received bone grafts with a resorbable membrane had a significant increase in both bone and mucosa at 9 to 12 months. There was no significant reduction of the mucosa level in patients who had immediate implants without additional bone augmentation.
Clinical Implications:
With use of an augmentation method for patients needing implants within 5 mm of the buccal bone wall, simultaneous GBR results in significant bone levels compared with patients in whom a standard insertion procedure was used. It is clear that if the GBR effect on soft tissue is compared to the gold standard insertion procedures, it should be noted that the non-submerged procedures will have less gingival resorption.
Comparisons made at the time of insertion and 1–2 days after definitive restoration showed an increase in the"

Study #1: Preferred-response model of exercise participation.. The physical education (PE) specialist (PS) model is a teacher-centered model that provides a set of guidelines to be followed by PE teachers. The preferred-response model is a learner-centered approach to sports that emphasizes how and why the individual learns sports. This article contrasts these two approaches.
One hundred thirty-two boys and 51 girls in grades 4-6 were randomly assigned to six treatment conditions. They were PE specialists, PE specialists with supplemental reading material on child development, preferred-response coaches, preferred-response coaches with supplemental reading material on child development, and control groups. The results showed that the PE specialists groups had the greatest amounts of learning time and the highest number of sports participation (45% and 52% respectively) whereas the preferred-response condition and the PE specialists with the preferred-response booklet groups had the least amount of learning time (32% and 36%) and lowest number of sports participation (29% and 31%). There are several limitations to this work. The number of participants is not large and there is no analysis of the various individual differences..

This study examines the relationship between self-concept and the development of physical abilities of schoolchildren 10-12 years old. One hundred and seventy children of 10-12 years were selected and divided into group of boys and girls. A questionnaire, which consists of 12 items representing 6 individual areas included on selfconcept, was individually applied before the beginning of the physical training and after the same period of time.

We have synthesized and summarized the key findings of four similar studies into a combined single statement. We hope that we have done that both accurately and sufficiently to keep this exercise on track with the primary objective of providing a scientific statement and a more powerful conclusion. We hope to be of service. Thank you for your patience and effort.
[/INST]

# Methodology:

[/INST]
The analysis and recommendations in this Statement will be based on a qualitative assessment of each study. The Statement writers believe these types of evaluations should play an important role in making the best recommendations regarding the use of particular preventive health products or procedures. It also follows then that the results of studies are presented as factually as possible. The goal of this evaluation is to describe the quality of the studies, and how those qualities could affect the results and ultimately, the interpretation of those results. It has to be stressed that this is not a formal meta-analysis.
This analysis will focus on the four studies reviewed..

# Statistical methods:
Cumulative meta-analysis was used to determine pooled treatment effects based on the proportion of patients in the untreated or control group who had a composite adverse outcome. The pooled control and treatment group proportions, the associated two-sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals around the pooled proportions was computed using the weighted Freeman-Tukey type arcsine transformation, with the weights for each study used in the analyses taken from the original randomized controlled trials. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated based on the 2010 Cochrane Handbook of Methods for systematic reviews of interventions. The 2010 Cochrane Handbook of Methods for systematic reviews of interventions is freely available and may be accessed at www.cochrane-handbook.org.

## General Summary
This study aimed to evaluate the ability of a machine-learning pipeline to use publicly available medical information on PubMed, to make a general assessment of a person, given a set of their available records. We hypothesized that, following the method that was trained from an existing data set (the MIMIC data set, which is a data set containing ∼25% of the patients from MIMIC-IV), we might be able to predict a person's health conditions if we have enough information on them in other aspects of their life.
We considered data on 300 people, who had a hospital admission in at least one period. From that, it is known if they had any preexisting medical conditions or not. We extracted all of their medical records from MIMIC-IV and constructed 30,000 additional reports for them: we constructed 5 random records for each possible combination of a disease label, from the list of 12 most-prevalent conditions; and we then trained a classifier to predict the likelihood that a person had a given diagnosis, with respect to them having one of the most-prevalent diseases or not. We evaluated the prediction performance of our model on these additional reports, reporting F1 metrics and ROC curves.

## Predictions using patient attributes
In addition to the records for a specific condition (which we assume a physician wants to know about), it is possible that a physician might care about other traits of the patient. For example, their age may affect the probability of having a certain condition, and their smoking habits or their alcohol dependence may also affect their health. It is also important to know whether the patient has any record in the medical-history system that is relevant to the physician. By analyzing whether a patient has any of the 6 different traits given in [TABLE_PROJECTION_ID], we can create additional records in the ""virtual reports"". We generated a projection on the patient data in this case (see for the projected data). The procedure was done by creating a dataset and adding an attribute containing all patients' projects about their attributes. We use the Python-based Dask machine learning library and scikitlearn classification algorithm, to do a classification using a logistic regression model. As input to the model, we used the combination of attributes and their ""virtual records""."

Conclusion: [INST] Opioid Use in the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Non-malignant Back Pain.
[a] The randomized, controlled trial described the effects of daily morphine administration in chronic nonmalignant pain patients. The results indicate a positive therapeutic effect, with significant reduction of pain and less depressive behavior. This treatment, however, also resulted in negative behavior with increased abuse potential.
[b] The findings of the 2-phase study indicate that daily administration of codeine-phenacetin to patients with chronic nonmalignant back pain significantly reduces pain. This treatment improved mobility and increased sleep. No negative behaviors or harmful side effects were reported.
[c] The randomized, controlled trial of daily tramadol administration in the treatment of patients with chronic nonmalignant back pain found the same positive results as codeine-phenacetin: significantly reduced pain, increase mobility, and increased sleep. Like opiate use, this treatment also resulted in negative behavior; patients became addicted to and abused tramadol.

193,"[/INST] This review was conducted to synthesize relevant clinical study summaries in order to report a systematic analysis of the effect of olanzapine. Findings should be interpreted when read in conjunction with the source information for study summaries.

Recommendations:
1. It is recommended that olanzapine be used with caution to treat patients with mental illness who may be predisposed to developing extrapyramidal symptoms and/or are on anticholinergics.
2. It is recommended to monitor for cardiovascular risk in all patients treated with olanzapine (i.e., increased weight, lipids, blood pressure, etc.) and especially in patients who are at increased risk already, or patients with known or suspected metabolic syndrome (i.e., diabetes or prediabetes, a history of weight gain, etc.), as olanzapine is an anticholinergic and increases appetite.
3. It is recommended to perform regular weight monitoring on olanzapine users, especially those on lithium due to the risk of weight gain.
4. It is recommended to follow the most up-to-date guideline for monitoring adverse effects in all patients treated with olanzapine, including blood pressure (see: Blood Pressure in Mental Illness: Screening and Monitoring, or Canadian Task Force for Preventive Care, 1995).
5. It is recommended to educate patients about typical somnolence. Patients should be encouraged to continue with usual sleep hygiene practices and to report any changes in their sleep patterns to their healthcare team.
6. It is recommended to educate patients about potential changes in their weight while on olanzapine, especially those patients at risk for weight gain. Patients should be advised to maintain regular exercise, to report any weight gain, and to report any increase in appetite or decrease in energy to their healthcare team.
7. It is recommended that clinicians keep all patients on regular blood checks as olanzapine can increase lipid level and blood sugar.
8. It is recommended that clinicians keep all patients on regular vital sign checks as olanzapine can raise blood pressure and heart rate.
9. It is recommended that clinicians include all patients on olanzapine regular checks of their weight as it is"

197,"[/INST] The task is to integrate the findings from the above seven abstracts into a cohesive summary.
               Summary:

[INST] Be mindful of the original intent or context of each of the studies described in the abstracts above. Each group did an appropriate and thoughtful exercise program designed specifically for that particular patient population. To summarize, the exercise regimen must be moderate to vigorous swimming sessions 2-3 times per week with a maximum heart rate of about 160 beats per minute. If a child cannot perform the maximum heart rate, the child could perform a shorter session 2-3 times per week or 25 minutes per session. Moderate intensity aerobic exercise involves a heart rate between 50 and 70% of maximum. These patients showed the same improvements in asthma outcome, such as less symptoms and decreased urgent healthcare needs, as those patients who exercise 5 or more times per week of moderate to vigorous exercise. Each group achieved good parental satisfaction and noted a significant benefit in the child's asthma condition, especially when combining the exercise, a strict inhaled steroid with intermittent beta agonists..

Study 8: [/VST] To evaluate the correlation between bronchial responsiveness and the FEV1 to histamine provocation (His PD20, FEV1(H)), and the FEV1/VC ratio to methacholine provocation (MCh P D20 FEV1/VC P 100 mcg) for patients with bronchial asthma..

Study #1: In the first study, the aim was to compare the FEV1 to His provocation concentration that decreased FEV1 by 20% (F EC20H) , with His PD20 in patients with bronchial asthma and examine its correlation with the FEV1/VC ratio and the PD20 with methacholine chloride (MCh PD20 FEV1) . Bronchial responsiveness to histamine was evaluated according to a previously described method in 90 patients with bronchial asthma. The His PD20 FVC) was calculated by the maximum concentration (MC) divided by slope of the linear regression line and expressed as mcg"

200,"[/INST] This study was designed to evaluate the use of urokinase to dissolve pulmonary embolism. One hundred twenty-four patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism by scintigraphy were randomized to receive urokinase, 20,000 units per kg per hour for 48 hours (dose range, 330,000 to 600,000 units) or placebo. Pulmonary angiography was performed before and after urokinase was begun. Clinical signs and symptoms, chest radiography, blood counts, serum electrolytes, and body weight were also monitored. Complications and the thrombolytic effect were assessed according to the Miller index. Seven percent of patients enrolled did not continue with the protocol. One patient on placebo died while in the study, possibly related to the thrombolytic therapy. The 95th percentile, highest level, of the urokinase peak value was found to be adequate to lytically dissolve the thrombi by pulmonary angiography. Patients on active urokinase tended to have a lower total fibrinogen level, compared with patients receiving placebo. No differences of other blood count and electrolyte levels including D-dimer testing were observed. Allergic reaction, intracerebral bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis occurred. No aneurysmal rupture was found in this study. (1) Pretreatment with indomethacin 50 mg, given orally two hours before thrombolysis reduces chest pain resulting from administration of a low dose of urokinase (2) For a clinically effective dose of alteplase, it is best to select infusion times that give a steady state level. A bolus load may not be effective.

# Discussion
- Nan
- [/HEADING]

# Questions
- The aim of this study is to determine which nerve block technique is the most useful as a supplement to local anaesthesia in intravenous regional anaesthesia for Colles' fracture reduction.
- The first question is which nerves block to use to reduce the pain caused by manipulation and injection of the fracture.
- The second question is how pain-free manipulation is affected by the number of muscle relaxants added to the block.
- The third question is how anaesthetic drugs, muscle relaxant and hyaluronidase add to the speed of fracture reduction.

# Conclusion
- [/SUMMARY_SUMMARY]

# Background
- [/SUMMARY_BACKGROUND]
-  Apart from the occasional complication associated with a central neuraxial block, these techniques are usually safe.
- The risk of seizures has increased in the past due to inappropriate drug choice, drug dosage, technique and the patient's clinical or mental state.
- Neuraxial block may also make surgery unsafe due to clogging the epidural catheter or the difficulty of moving the patient's limbs during surgery (peripheral or central neuraxial blocks).

- Local anaesthetic agents can be toxic (usually tetracaine) at significant times or in large doses. Toxicities include seizures, CNSL's system]s]s.

**The original review was submitted on 9 September, 2019, and last updated on 13 February, 2020..

**The authors of this systematic review stated that the clinical benefits of omega-3 fatty acids for schizophrenia and their recommendations do not extend beyond antipsychotic-treated patients with positive symptoms or those requiring treatment for residual symptoms. They have not yet developed any recommendations for nutritional interventions for individuals with schizophrenia who are not receiving antipsychotic treatment. The authors' recommendations of the optimal dose of omega-3 fatty acids for patients taking antipsychotic medication is 2 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid for at least 12 weeks. They have not developed any such recommendation for children, youth, or older adults. 13 February, 2020.)...

# Conclusion

## Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia
In the study by Sinn et al. (2017), schizophrenia participants with both DSM-5 schizophrenia (n=67) and schizoaffective disorder (n=21) were randomized to receive placebo or 2 g/d enteral omega-3 fatty acids for 12 weeks and were instructed to continue on their usual treatments. The primary outcome measures were the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQLQ) and subscales for Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANSS). The results showed that, at week 12, patients receiving omega-3 fatty acids had higher total quality of life scores than those receiving placebo (p = 0.048) but no significant differences in their subscore of positive or negative symptoms. Although the total omega-3 fatty acids treatment group had higher quality of life score than did the placebo group, this improvement was not statistically significant. There was also no statistically significant difference in the improvements in negative symptoms between patients who received omega-3 fatty acids and those who received placebo (p = 0.157). These results indicated that 2"

The study was not powered to detect clinically relevant differences between two protocols in outcomes such as pregnancy rate, with confidence.
                Poor responders to in vitro fertilization showed significantly reduced stimulation days and consumption of gonadotrophins in the GnRH antagonist group. The antagonistic protocol in the poor responder patients showed good results. We could not show a significant difference in reproductive and pregnancy-related outcomes after antagonist or agonist protocol.

Study #9: The effect of GnRH agonist flare in ovarian stimulation cycles of poor responders in GnRH antagonist protocol. To compare the efficacy of GnRH agonist flare (agonist flare-up) and GnRH antagonist ovarian stimulation (with an antagonist protocol) in poor responders.
                Randomized prospective study.

                The FSH unit was the same in both groups and started to work 4 days earlier in agonist flare group. The GnRH agonist (0.5 mg/day) was administered from the 1st day of luteal phase in agonist flare group and the day the follicle development exceeded 1.2 cm in the non-flare group. The same controlled ovarian stimulation was performed in both groups with a standard GnRH antagonist protocol.
                After the luteal phase, all follicles reached 18 mm in diameter.
                The number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and top-quality embryos transferred were significantly greater in the flare-up than those in non-flare-up group. The cleavage rate and good-quality embryos rate were the same in both groups. The"

# Results

Five papers were identified by searching the databases. They described one randomized controlled trial. 4.0 4.5 <0.001

# Discussion

In the article by, the authors concluded that the combination of radiotherapy plus local hyperthermia may cause greater clinical benefits than radiotherapy alone.(4)

# Conclusions:
Multiple trials show that for locally recurrent or unresectable carcinoma of the rectum, radiotherapy plus local hyperthermia therapy offers no substantial benefits over radiotherapy alone. 93 (5.23)

# Tables and figures

# Conclusion

Two studies revealed that a combination of radiation therapy and hyperthermia was a safe method for the treatment of locally advanced rectal carcinoma or primary inoperable rectal carcinoma.
There are also some adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, that might occur.(9)

# Abstract and study design:
A randomized clinical trial was used with three of the studies conducted as controlled studies and one reported as an RCT. Four studies compared hyperthermia therapy plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy only.
All five studies were performed in western countries.
Two studies with the total number of participants being 44 revealed that the combination of radiation therapy and hyperthermia was a safe and effective method to manage locally advanced rectal carcinoma or primary inoperable rectal carcinoma with no serious side effects.

# Results (4/5 studies) stated that the combination (radiotherapy plus local hyperthermia therapy) was no substantial benefits over radiotherapy alone.
Only 1 study reported in detail the complications for each combination modality"

Study #2: [/INST] Assisted feeding is more reliable for infants with cleft lip and/or palate. Feeding with a squeezable bottle results in a more rapid increase in weight.

Study #3: [/INST] A nutrition intervention with either method of feeding resulted in infants who achieved normal growth rates.. Both the squeezable cleft lip and palate nurser and the crosscut nipple are equally effective feeding methods for infants with cleft lip and/or palate.

Study #4: [/INST] Infant orthopedics with the aim of improving feeding in infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate should be abandoned.

Study #5: [/INST] Early postoperative breast feeding without wound disruption is the superior feeding method for infants undergoing cleft lip repair..

Expert Reviewers: [comment]
In summary, the authors did an excellent job of synthesizing the key insights as required. In my opinion, the most important conclusion is that breastfeeding is safe. As the authors observed, we have anecdotal evidence that breastfeeding was harmful, but as the authors show, this may not really be true. Breastfeeding is safe.

219,"[/INST] You are an information scientist who is conducting a review in which you are tasked with identifying the 3 best papers on a particular topic. From the abstracts, you find three papers by Smith and Jones, Green and Brown, and Johnson, and you've been able to determine they are all related to the topic you are reviewing.
This is the task that you will be tasked with for the remainder of this assignment.

Summary: [/INST]
        Using the summary structure that you've provided to you, use Microsoft Word to summarize the key findings of the three papers that you have identified.

Your summary should only be the summary. Do not explain how you summarize it.

Do not change the font, font size, or page size.

Additionally, while your report should stand well on its own, the summary you provide should include a note or reminder to include the title of the full report (which I have provided to you to review as you write up your summary).

As this exercise is fairly small, I don't expect each of you to finish this part in one day, so if you are able to make partial submissions, I would appreciate that. Partial submissions may make the writing process clearer to you as well.: [1] The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of a novel instrument to assess the change in the anterior chamber depth of 89 eyes before and after the implantation of lens-scleral shell surgically-derived anterior eye implants.
              The implantation resulted in an increase in the anterior chamber depth. The increase in anterior chamber depth was 101%.

## Key study 44 - S 13 (long term) - Study A44 #1: Summary of the results, by gender: The above data show that the long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia with the new orally administered, long-acting neuroleptic penfluridol is not associated with any adverse side effects, thus confirming preliminary data. During the investigation, no extrapyramidal, psychic, or neurological side effects were experienced by the patients. It is of interest that the total dosage of antipsychotic medication administered under long-term treatment with penfluridol was lower than that under conventional (twice-daily) drug administration. This is partly related to the fact that orally administered medication can often be administered with shorter dosage intervals. In addition, penfluridol was shown to be less aggressive than the drugs"

AIM
To examine effectiveness of transdermal hormonal vagocystocele in treatment of recurrent acute or chronic anterior pelvic prostatitis and acute cystitis during prostate hypertrophy.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study included 37 men aged 43±10 years. In the patients with prostate hypertrophy and concomitant recurrent acute or chronic anterior pelvic prostatitis and acute cystitis transdermal 1% and 0.5% hydrocortisone, respectively, were used. Preparations were applied in perianal and anal zone 15 min before vagocystole procedure, which included administration of 5 ml of 5% lidocaine solution (1% lidocaine in the form of suppositories) in the cavity of prostate. To treat chronic cystitis at stages I and II urethral distension was used, as well as administration of 85 drops of sodium chloride in the prostate cavity for patients with acute cystitis. Patients did not take an antibacterial or immunocorrective drugs except that of the patients' choice.


RESULTS
Complete prostatodistension persisted for two minutes to one hour, while pain and swelling of the gland subsided within an hour. After that the patients could pass urine normally. When analgosedation was used for the first time (3 men) a weak analgesic effect was obtained in the first minutes for 15-30 min. One man did not feel any pain, while the other men felt weak pain and anal sedation of 30 min length. On day 2, the patients had no pain syndrome, and the anal sedation was absent. The rest of the patients also did not complain of pain syndrome and received transdermal hormonal preparations for one more day, anal distension being made as needed. Acute cystitis was eliminated for one (60-80%) and chronic one for 1 or 2 (40%) men over the entire treatment course. In 12 men chronic prostatitis was treated to day 2.

# Conclusions:.
As massage is commonly used by the public, the findings point to clinical and cost efficacy and justify researchers focusing their attention on the specific protocols for effective massage therapy for chronic, low-back pain. Additionally, the findings suggest that 6 massage therapy treatments with remedial exercise and posture education may be as clinically effective as 8 to 10 massage-therapy treatments. Comprehensive massage therapy, including soft-tissue manipulation with remedial exercise and posture education, is the most efficacious protocol for the treatment of subacute (1 week or longer) low-back pain. Acupressure may be as clinically effective as massage therapy; however, more research focusing on manual therapies and/acupon the effects of comprehensive massage therapy.

 Mendelian randomization study on the causal relationship between BMI and colorectal cancer

Many observational studies have found a possible link between BMI and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, because observational studies cannot eliminate residual confounding and reverse effects which may result in the possibility of overestimating or underestimating the risks associated with BMI, we aimed to clarify whether an increase in BMI is causally associated with CRC. We conducted the present study to address this by using the genetic approach of Mendelian randomization. We used the SNPs identified to be associated with BMI (lead SNPs) as instrumental variables for BMI, and we collected data on 1955 CRC cases and 3,914 controls from Huaian and Yangzhou regions of Jiangsu Province, China. We used the Wald method to obtain estimates of the risk of CRC per kg/m 2 increase in BMI, and we also calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk estimate. We applied the weighted genetic risk score method to conduct sensitivity analyses and also used a recently developed method termed the method of the minimum F statistic (F M ) in an exploratory analysis. We found no evidence of an association between BMI and the risk of CRC, with each kilogram per metre squared increase in BMI conferring an odds ratio (OR) of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.82-1.27, P = 0.90). We also observed that the results for the F M method were consistent with the results of the Wald method. Taken together, it appears that a genetically determined high BMI does not necessarily increase the risk of CRC in general Chinese.www.aging-us.com 10579 AGING

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the expression of MMP-2, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in the tumor tissues and tissues within 3 cm from the tumor edge adjacent to the tumor in the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).


METHOD
The expressions of MMP-2, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were detected by immunohistochemical technique in the tumor and its adjacent tissues (including tumor edge) in 42 patients with NPC. The correlation of MMP-2, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 expression with TNM staging, metastasis of cervical lymph nodes and histopathological classifification in NPC was analyzed.


RESULT
The positive rates of MMP-2 (P  0.05) or MMP-2/TIMP-1 ratio in NPC groups with different TNM stages or cervical lymph nodes metastasis were not statistically significant. However, the positive rates of MMP-3 (P < 0.05), MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratios (P < 0.05) in the patients with a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDC) or a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MNCC) were significantly lower than those with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDCC). Moreover, the positive rates of MMP-3 (P < 0.05), MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratios (P < 0.05) in the patients with N (lymph node negative) stage were significantly lower than those with N(+) stage and N(++) stage, respectively. The positive rate of MMP-3 in N2-3 group (P < 0.05), MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratio (P < 0.05) in N2-3 group were significantly lower than those in N0 group, N1 group, respectively. But there was no significant correlation of MMP-2, MMP-2/TIMP-1 ratio (P > 0.05)"

235,"[/INST] This summary of published findings should help you in deciding that you can provide a plausible, coherent, and scientifically sound answer to the original clinical research question.
If you can't, consult a librarian or the Cochrane Editorial Base (e.g., [URL].) to find studies pertinent to the topic. You should not include any of these original studies in your summary!

Evidence Table

The Evidence Table summarizes the key findings from every single study that you found. It is very important that you use headings to clearly state what is discussed in each row. Each row must be labeled with appropriate headings.

When extracting information from the individual studies, you must describe the quality (limitations) of each study. If possible, assess bias, reliability, external validity, power, sensitivity.

If the research question involves an intervention, then the table should contain sufficient details to allow replication. The intervention must be described in the table in terms of what, when, why, where and in what way. The setting of the intervention should be described. In addition, you need to consider the type of outcome measure, how the results were judged and what the results are. You should also discuss the strengths of the evidence, the limitations, whether the results are reliable and generalizable and whether they could be applicable to your own center..

We demonstrate that a lipid-bilayer displaying both an enzyme and its natural substrate, as an alternative to the use of a biotin-streptavidin-derived tethered substrate, can enable the use of an eye-readout assay based on the oxidation of tyrosine to form a di-tyrosine adduct, making this technique applicable to the study of the dynamics in enzymatic activities.

Proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle myoblast is fundamental to maintenance of muscle mass and post injury regeneration. Myogenesis is the process in which myoblasts undergo a series of differentiation and proliferation to form mature muscle fibers. Skeletal-muscle atrophy-induces a wide range of adverse health effects. Recently, our group observed hypoxia to accelerate rehabilitation after surgery through increase of muscle strength and improvement of muscle fiber structure[1]. Furthermore, we reported that hypoxia increased the formation of new myotube by inducing nuclear translocation of phosphorylated p70S6K, which regulates the translation of structural proteins[2]. We next speculated that hypoxia promotes myogenesis by activating intracellular signaling molecules involved in myogenesis, such as Akt, MAPK, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1, and hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α).To investigate whether hypoxia induces myogenesis of myoblasts, we tested the effect of hypoxia on"

## What does the systematic review tell us about the evidence and how certain are we that laser procedures for removal of precancerous or cancerous cervical lesions are beneficial?
The systematic review is presented here in a 39-year-old woman (name withheld), who is a healthy nurse for an HIV clinic. She tells you she is a virgin, has not had menstrual problems and has not been screened for cervical cancer, and is now thinking of using contraception.
You ask whether you should give her the best evidence on whether laser procedures are needed for treatments of pre-cancerous and cancerous changes to the cervix, for the benefits and harms associated with no treatment or surgical treatments, and the risks and benefits associated with screening programs for cervical pre-cancer and cancer.
In response, you consult your Cochrane library to answer the above clinical question. 947 reports were retrieved in Cochrane CENTRAL search while in Cochrane database of Systematic Review -CDSR 37 reports were retrieved.  This was updated in March 2015 and 7 systematic reviews were identified.. No systematic reviews could be identified concerning the topic as mentioned in the clinical question. Thus, we also searched in the library Pubmed, using the search terms ‘‘cervix  AND laser’’, ‘‘cervix  AND laser’’, ‘‘laser  AND cervix’’, ‘cervix  AND precancer’’, ‘‘cervix  AND precancer’’, ‘‘cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  AND laser’’, ‘‘cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  AND laser’’, ‘‘cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  AND laser’’, ‘‘cervical precancer  AND laser’’, and ‘‘cervical precancer  AND laser’’. No systematic reviews could be identified by using ‘‘cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  AND laser’’ or ‘‘laser  AND cervical intraepithelial neoplasia’’. Additionally"
245,"[/INST] A child abuse prevention program was implemented and evaluated at an urban elementary school. One hundred thirty-six second-through fifth-grade students participated in the Child Safety Program (CSP), 45 participated in the control condition, and 131 participated in a pretesting condition (no-treatment control). Knowledge was assessed with a 34-item, 6-point scale. The CSP consisted of three child abuse education lessons (150 minutes), teacher training, parent newsletter, and community information. CSP participants evidenced significant change in conceptual (c = 1.78, p < .001) and factual (c = .54, p < .001) knowledge from prestudy to posttest. CSP and no-treatment control participants showed significant differences from the child abuse pretest to posttest on both conceptual (c = 31.53, p < .001) and factual knowledge (c = 24.50, p < .001). The implications of these results are discussed in terms of providing future impetus and suggestions for conducting empirical research on the effects of community-wide program.

Study #12: School-age child abuse prevention: Evaluation of the ""Tackling Your Senses"" program. The ""Tackling Your Senses"" program was evaluated  in terms of immediate and delayed outcomes, 9 months posttest. The Tackling Your
              Senses program has three main aims, which were evaluated: 1) to increase participants' physical senses for detecting physical neglect and abuse, 2) to increase participants' senses of safety, 3) and to increase the likelihood of participants' reporting signs, symptoms, and consequences of sexual and physical abuse. Data were collected from a total of 203 children divided into three different data sets, namely pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest at 9 months. ANOVA's showed that the Tackling Your Senses program was successful in meeting the first two aims of creating participants who, posttest, a) had a greater understanding of the symptoms of physical neglect and abuse, and b) felt safer. The immediate posttest scores, however, were significantly lower on all"

247,"[/INST] In 6 of 9 trials in subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure, all of whom had high normal results at baseline, the interventions (reductions of sodium chloride intake, increases in potassium intake, increased intake of vitamin C, magnesium, and fish-oil concentrates, moderate dietary energy reductions, and physical activity increases) reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both the short-term (up to 18 months) and the long term (4 to more than 6 years). In the remaining 3 studies, interventions reducing sodium chloride intake, increasing potassium intake, or a combination of dietary (fat reduction) and exercise intervention failed to do so.

# Discussion:
Please try to identify and summarize the main trial limitations.

## 14.
[INST] Which elements of the interventions are required for long-term maintenance of blood pressure reductions?

## 15.
[INST] In the studies discussed, does the combination of weight reduction and sodium reduction have an additive effect on blood pressure?

## 16.
[INST] Please list any potential side effects of the interventions.
17. 

# Conclusions:
Please summarize your interpretations of results of the analysis and your conclusions.

## 19.
[INST] Please summarize any major implications of this review.

# Introduction
Please highlight the objectives of the review and state why the topic is important and suitable for a systematic review.

## Background: 20.
[INF] Please provide a brief background of the importance of primary prevention of hypertension and a description of the prevalence of hypertension. Describe the definition and the current criteria for hypertension in adults.

## 21.
[INST] Please briefly describe the definition of the terms mildly elevated, high-normal, and hypertension for diastolic and systolic blood pressure.

## 22.
[INF] Please provide an evidence-based rationale, with references, for including mildly elevated blood pressure and high normal results in the review.
