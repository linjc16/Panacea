0,"[/INST] These studies tested the efficacy and safety of different drugs and doses to treat occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). There are several medications under investigation, including alfimeprase, r-UK, alteplase, UK and r-TpA. The results of the studies vary, but all of them showed a superior efficacy in restoring the patency of occluded CVAD in one or two instillations compared to the control group. The side effects of these drugs are minimal and no serious adverse events have been reported in any of these studies. Alfimeprase showed to be the most effective drug in restoring the patency when used alone or in combination with another drug compared to other fibrinolytic agents which can be used as safe alternatives."
