0,"[/INST] These studies tested the efficacy and safety of different drugs and doses to treat occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). There are several medications under investigation, including alfimeprase, r-UK, alteplase, UK and r-TpA. The results of the studies vary, but all of them showed a superior efficacy in restoring the patency of occluded CVAD in one or two instillations compared to the control group. The side effects of these drugs are minimal and no serious adverse events have been reported in any of these studies. Alfimeprase showed to be the most effective drug in restoring the patency when used alone or in combination with another drug compared to other fibrinolytic agents which can be used as safe alternatives."
1,"[/INST] Two RCTs from the University of Heidelberg, with sample sizes of 197 and 70, respectively, concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the overall peristomal wound infection rate. Another RCT from the University Hospital of Giessen in Germany, with a sample size of 119, stated that a single dose regimen of Cefazolin or Cefotaxime antibiotics reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection from 29.4% to 21%. These two trials are similar in design, excluding the effect of antibiotic in reducing the overall peristomal wound infection rate and in evaluating the effect of different antibiotic regimens. The study from Heidelberg was more critical in controlling extraneous factors such as gastric tube type, insertion method and handlers. The trial from Giessen was more critical in controlling the study population, excluding the possibility of confounding factors from other studies. The results are inconsistent. For decision-makers, there is insufficient evidence to adopt or reject the intervention. For trial sponsors, the evidence is more in favour of doing more high quality, well designed RCTs."
