Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Low Back Pain Patient Education Evaluation\n\n\nSummary: Back pain is one of the most common of all symptoms. It is also a great cause of days lost from work and visits to health care providers. This study will develop and evaluate an approach to low back pain that allows subjects to talk with each other and with health professionals via an Internet discussion group. Results we will look at include health behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care use, such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Anyone 18 years old or older who lives in the United States and has ongoing Internet access can take part in the study. All subjects must have back pain and meet the eligibility criteria listed below.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMust live in the United States\nMust understand and write English\nMust have access to a computer with e-mail and expect to have this access for at least 3 years\nMust be 18 years old\nMust have seen a doctor for back pain at least once in the past year\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's go through the patient note and the inclusion criteria step by step.\n\n1. Must live in the United States: The patient note doesn't mention the patient's address, but it doesn't explicitly state that they don't live in the United States either. So, I'll give this a neutral assessment.\n\n2. Must understand and write English: The patient note is written in English, and there's no indication that the patient doesn't understand or write English. So, I'll give this a neutral assessment.\n\n3. Must have access to a computer with e-mail and expect to have this access for at least 3 years: The patient note doesn't mention the patient's access to a computer or email. However, the patient is presenting to the ER, which suggests that they may have access to a computer or phone to communicate with healthcare providers. I'll give this a 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.\n\n4. Must be 18 years old: The patient is 58 years old, which is above the age requirement. So, I'll give this a 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\n5. Must have seen a doctor for back pain at least once in the past year: The patient note doesn't mention the patient's previous medical history or visits to doctors. However, the patient is presenting to the ER with chest pain, which is not related to back pain. So, I'll give this a 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's review the assessment:\n\n1. Must live in the United States: Neutral assessment\n2. Must understand and write English: Neutral assessment\n3. Must have access to a computer with e-mail and expect to have this access for at least 3 years: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation\n4. Must be 18 years old: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial\n5. Must have seen a doctor for back pain at least once in the past year: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial\n\nSince the patient is not eligible due to age and lack of previous doctor's visit for back pain, the overall trial-level eligibility is:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThat's correct! The patient is not eligible for the clinical trial due to their age and lack of previous doctor's visit for back pain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's move on to the next patient note and clinical trial. Please provide the next patient note and clinical trial, and I'll assess the patient's eligibility for the trial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPlease go ahead and provide the next patient note and clinical trial.
