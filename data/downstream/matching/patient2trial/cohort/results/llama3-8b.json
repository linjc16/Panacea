However, the patient note mentions that the patient is reluctant to see a nutritionist and is not compliant with her diabetes medication or exercise, which suggests that the patient may have type 2 diabetes. The inclusion criteria include patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, so this factor does not disqualify the patient.\n4. Previous therapy: The patient is not taking their diabetes medication as prescribed, which may indicate that they are not under their previous therapy. However, the inclusion criteria do not specify that patients must be under their previous therapy, only that they must have insufficiently controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus under their previous therapy. So, this factor does not disqualify the patient.\n5. Skin lesion: The patient has a painful skin lesion on the left lower leg, which is not related to the inclusion criteria. So, this factor does not disqualify the patient.\n\nBased on the above assessment, I would say that the patient is eligible for the clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.<|eot_id|>",
