This would ordinarily be associated with minimal systemic disease burden.\n   - Accessible for treatment and follow-up.\n   - Patient is infertile or is aware of the risk of becoming pregnant or fathering children and will use adequate contraception.\n   - Written informed consent.\n\nComparing the patient note to the inclusion criteria:\n- The patient has a left lung mass and a solitary mass in the right frontal lobe, which meets the inclusion criteria of a single presumed brain metastasis.\n- The patient's age (58 years) meets the inclusion criteria.\n- The patient's performance status is not explicitly stated, but the note mentions that the patient is otherwise asymptomatic, which suggests a good performance status.\n- The patient's systemic cancer is not mentioned, so it is unclear if the patient meets this inclusion criterion.\n- The patient's ability to undergo treatment and follow-up is not explicitly stated, so it is unclear if the patient meets this inclusion criterion.\n- The patient's fertility status and use of contraception are not mentioned, so it is unclear if the patient meets this inclusion criterion.\n- The patient's written informed consent is not mentioned, so it is unclear if the patient meets this inclusion criterion.\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient appears to meet some of the inclusion criteria, but there is not enough information to determine if the patient meets all of the criteria.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",
