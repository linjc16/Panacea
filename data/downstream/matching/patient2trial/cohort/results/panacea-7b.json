The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life.

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Pharmacodynamic Study of Carvedilol Versus Metoprolol in Heart Failure\n\n\nSummary: Metoprolol succinate is a beta1-selective beta-blocker, becoming non-selective at higher doses, while carvedilol is non-selective. We examined whether metoprolol remained beta1-selective compared to carvedilol during dose up-titration in Class C heart failure (HF) Beta-blocker na\u00efve patients.~METHODS: Twenty-five NYHA FC II-III HF patients were randomized to carvedilol or metoprolol. Patients were studied at baseline and after 2 weeks of up-titration (metoprolol at 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg daily; carvedilol IR at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg and 50mg twice daily). Beta2- blockade was determined by an infusion of terbutaline at 6 mg/kg over 1 hour. Glucose and potassium levels were serially measured at baseline, every 15 minutes for the 1st hour and 30 minutes for 2nd hour post-infusion. The median area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and potassium changes were calculated.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients eligible for the study had objective evidence of systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%), were >18 years of age, and were on stable optimal medical heart failure therapy excluding the use of beta-blockers within the previous 30 days.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

They are assessed by clinical history including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT calcium scoring (CTCS) is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, citation 1) proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain who have low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). They recommend that patients with low likelihood (10-30%) have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.~At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the traditional assessment. We also plan to follow-up these patients for any myocardial infarction and death from any cause.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nnon-acute chest pain\nthose who underwent CT calcium scoring\navailability of all relevant risk factor information\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life.

Various pain assessment tools, (such as NRS) have been developed and validated to objectively monitor and treat pain. There are certain patient populations, in whom, the current pain assessment tools cannot be used effectively due to communication problems such as cognitively impaired patients. In the US, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has made it mandatory to monitor and treat pain. In the absence of reliable pain assessment tools that would objectively measure pain, there is also risk of under treatment and overtreatment of pain that may lead to negative outcomes. Therefore, a monitor that is able to predict pain levels objectively, will help to achieve above goals. The investigators are using Skin Conductance Algesimeter (SCA) to measure pain by analyzing changes in skin conductance.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients undergoing unilateral THR and TKR who are between the ages of 18 and 85 regardless of the anesthesia and postoperative analgesia type.\nPatients participating in other studies may participate in this study as well\nPatients with Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) Score of 3 and 4\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right femoral artery earlier in the morning.
