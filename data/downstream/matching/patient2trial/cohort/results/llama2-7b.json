His past medical history is notable for heavy smoking, spinal stenosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and mild psoriasis. He also has a family history of early onset dementia. His symptoms began about a week prior to his admission, with productive cough, purulent sputum, and difficulty breathing, requiring him to use his home oxygen for the past 24 hours. He denies fever. On examination, he is cyanotic, tachypneic, with a barrel-shaped chest, and diffuse rales over his lungs. A chest X-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Continuous Infusion Piperacillin-tazobactam for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis\n\nSummary: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder leading to chronic pulmonary inflammation and infection. A majority of people with cystic fibrosis have large quantities of bacteria residing in their lungs. One of the most common and harmful bacteria is called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with cystic fibrosis require frequent therapy with intravenous (I.V.) antibiotics to treat lung infections thought to be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the antibiotics frequently used to treat this bacteria is piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam is thought to be the most effective when there is a constant level of drug in the body. The standard way to administer piperacillin-tazobactam is to give several grams 4 times each day as a 30-minute infusion. An alternative way to give piperacillin-tazobactam is by a continuous infusion; a continuous infusion will make it more likely that drug will remain at a constant level in the body. The objective of this study is to determine if administering piperacillin-tazobactam as a continuous infusion is more effective at treating people having a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis than a standard 30-minute infusion, 4 times a day.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis\n* 8 years of age or greater\n* Chronic or intermittent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as defined by the Leeds Criteria\n* Pulmonary exacerbation as defined by Fuchs et al.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis\n* Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment\n* Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

        "output": "Patient Note:\n\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: A Cluster Randomized Trial to Assess the Impact of Opinion Leader Endorsed Evidence Summaries on Improving Quality of Prescribing for Patients With Chronic Cardiovascular Disease\n\nSummary: BACKGROUND: Although much has been written about the influence of local opinion leaders on clinical practice, there have been few controlled studies of their effect, and almost none have attempted to change prescribing in the community for chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or ischemic heart disease (IHD). These two conditions are common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality - and very good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have demonstrated that about half of eligible CHF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (and fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently needed.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: An intervention that consists of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries, generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, will be able to change prescribing practices of community-based primary care physicians.\n\nDESIGN: A single centre randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader intervention to usual care. Based on random allocation of all physicians in one large Canadian health region, patients with CHF or IHD (not receiving ACE inhibitors or statins, respectively) recruited from community pharmacies will be allocated to intervention or usual care. The primary outcome is improvement in prescription of proven efficacious therapies for CHF (ACE inhibitors) or IHD (statins) within 6 months of the intervention.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients with HF or IHD who are not currently taking the study medications of interest (ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers for HF or statins for IHD) and whose primary care physicians are part of the study population.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Neuroimaging studies show moderately advanced cerebral atrophy. A cortical biopsy shows diffuse vacuolar changes of the gray matter with reactive astrocytosis but no inflammatory infiltration.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Vaginal Testosterone Cream For Atrophic Vaginitis in Women Taking Aromatase Inhibitors for Breast Cancer.\n\nSummary: Atrophic vaginitis is a condition in which the skin lining of the vagina and labia becomes thin and symptoms develop including vaginal itching, vaginal discomfort, and dyspareunia. These can significantly affect women's comfort, sexuality, and quality of life. Treatment for this condition includes estrogen given in pill form, commonly known as hormone replacement therapy, and local estrogen treatments, such as vaginal estrogen creams and topical vaginal lubricants. Unfortunately, systemic estrogen is contraindicated in many women with breast cancer. Some providers also feel that women who are taking aromatase inhibitors for their breast cancer should also not use local estrogens, as several small studies suggest that these treatments might affect estrogen levels and thus change how effective the aromatase inhibitors are. If these women choose not to use any form of estrogen therapy, their symptoms may not be well controlled with other treatments. The investigators hypothesize that a vaginal testosterone cream might be a safe and effective alternative treatment for these women. This small study is intended to test the hypothesis that testosterone cream will not increase estrogen levels and that it will improve the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, including vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and pain with intercourse. The investigators will enroll women in the trial who are taking an aromatase inhibitor and have the symptoms mentioned above. They will receive a testosterone cream, which will be applied vaginally once a day for 28 days. If good results are found with a prespecified dose of testosterone, a lower dose will be tested in the next group of women enrolled.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer (any stage)\n* Currently using an aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole, exemestane, or letrozole) for primary or adjuvant breast cancer treatment\n* Must have complaints of vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, and/or dyspareunia\n* Not undergoing active chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic treatment\n* Age >18 years\n* Life expectancy of greater than 2 months\n* CALGB (ZUBROD) performance status <3\n* Post-menopausal - defined by absence of menses for at least 12 months and/or an FSH >25.

Malignant skin diseases are known to be accompanied by structural alterations. Conventional excisional biopsies and further histopathology are regarded as the reference standard for investigating these pathologies. Biopsies are invasive procedures and additionally may cause side effects. Therefore, research efforts are focused on the development of diagnostic techniques capable of providing in vivo information on the skin's structure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technical application, which allows the identification of microscopic patterns indicative for benign and malignant skin lesions. OCT is a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the micromorphology of the skin. So far, it's clinical application, as an additional diagnostic tool for malignant skin lesions has been studied in a limited extend. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of OCT, we conducted a prospective pilot study at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna. The study is in cooperation with the Center of Biomedical Engineering and Physics at the Medical University of Vienna.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Seborrheic warts\n* Nevi\n* Dermatofibroma\n* Basal cell carcinoma\n* Actinic keratosis\n* Squamous cell carcinoma\n* Bowen's disease\n* Merkel cell carcinoma\n* Malignant melanoma\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

It has been established that early administration of fresh frozen plasma decreases mortality following severe injury, replacing lost coagulation factors, improving the coagulopathy and restoring blood volume.

An increase in RBC mass is a natural feature of altitude acclimatization. Hypoxia-induced erythropoietin (EPO) secretion begins hours after ascent and stimulates bone marrow production of red blood cells, but this takes weeks to effect an increase in red cell mass . Therefore, it is feasible that EPO therapy weeks before altitude exposure decrease high altitude illness.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Chronic elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart rate and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or norepinephrine-serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are considered treatment of first choice for these patients, however a substantial portion of patients do not respond sufficiently (Zhang and Davidson 2007). Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective add-on treatment strategies for these patients. Recently, atypical neuroleptics have received considerable attention since it was shown in multiple controlled and naturalistic trials that these medications are an effective treatment option for patients with PTSD (Davis et al 2006). In chronic PTSD, the psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment have yet been inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanisms of medications used in the treatment of PTSD. Therefore, in addition to evaluating the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of paliperidone, a novel atypical neuroleptic, in the treatment of PTSD, we also aim to compare neurophysiological responses at baseline with post-treatment effects in antidepressant-refractory PTSD patients.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Patients with croup are typically visited by physicians during two peak time periods throughout the year. The first one is in the autumn, usually as a result of parainfluenza virus, and the second peak occurs in early winter, a consequence of RSV. Croup affects males more commonly than females and affects children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years. The incidence of croup peaks in children at 2 years of age; croup in older children is uncommon, and recurrent episodes are frequently observed.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Written informed consent obtained by parents/legal representative prior to any study-related procedures.\n* Male or female subject aged between 6 months and 3 years referring to ER with acute onset barky cough, stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress.\n* Children with a diagnosis of moderate croup (Westley score 3-8).\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Anaesthesia in the elderly confers a higher risk, which is related to the aging process and the diseases that accompany seniority.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis\n* Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment\n* Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

She reports no complaints and is in general good health. The results of her PAP were cytology negative, HPV positive.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: HPV Testing for Cervical Cancer Screening Study\n\nSummary: This is a randomised controlled trial of HPV testing with cytology triage for HPV positive women compared to liquid-based cervical cytology (LBC). Although LBC is not widely used for cervical cancer screening in Canada at present, the Pan-Canadian Cervical Cancer Forum has recommended its use and as it is likely to be the standard of care by the time these data are published, the trial has been designed to account for this. Further, LBC will improve the cost-effectiveness of HPV testing because the LBC medium is suitable for both HPV testing as well as cytology and thereby allows the triage testing to be undertaken from the same sample without having to recall the women.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nWomen from 25 to 65 years of age, registered with the Medical Services Plain in BC attending a collaborating healthcare provider for routine cervical screening in Metro Vancouver or Greater Victoria.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Sleeping on the back during pregnancy has recently emerged in scientific literature as a potential risk factor for SB and LBW. In fact, one of the earliest studies to demonstrate this link was conducted in Ghana by investigators on this protocol. When a woman in mid-to-late-pregnancy lies on her back, her large uterus compresses one of the major veins that delivers blood back to her heart and may completely obstruct it. This may result in less blood being returned to her heart and less blood being pumped to her developing fetus. Such changes may negatively impact the growth of her fetus and, along with some other risk factors, may contribute to the death of her baby.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* \u226518 years old\n* Low-risk singleton pregnancy\n* Entering the last trimester of pregnancy (in range 26-30 weeks of gestation)\n* Residing in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area or area served by the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital\n* Fluent in either English, Twi, or Ga.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Relevant physical exam findings include a respiratory rate of 35 and right calf pain.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Dyspnea and Biomarkers in a Prehospital Setting\n\nSummary: In patients presenting with acute dyspnea in a pre-hospital setting, the early and correct diagnosis may present a significant clinical challenge. Physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and standard biological tests often fail to accurately differentiate heart failure (HF) from pulmonary causes of dyspnea. Timely differentiation of HF from other causes of dyspnea may permit the early institution of appropriate medical therapy. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been proposed as early markers of HF and demonstrated to be useful for diagnosing and excluding HF in the emergency department. A combination of BNP or NT-proBNP testing and standard clinical assessment has been suggested to be superior to either tool used in isolation. Some previous studies have also suggested that quantitative capnometry (QC) may be useful in differentiating between cardiac and obstructive causes of respiratory distress. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that a new combination of NT-proBNP testing, standard clinical assessment, and partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) would optimize evaluation and differentiation of acute dyspnea in a pre-hospital setting.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient had to present with shortness of breath as the primary complaint (defined as either the sudden onset of dyspnea without history of chronic dyspnea or an increase in the severity of chronic dyspnea)\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",
