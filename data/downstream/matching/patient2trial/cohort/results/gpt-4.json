        "output": "Given the information provided in the patient note:\n\nA physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right femoral artery earlier in the morning. She is now complaining of a cool right foot. Upon examination she has a pulsatile mass in her right groin with loss of distal pulses, and auscultation reveals a bruit over the point at which the right femoral artery was entered.\n\nAnd the clinical trial in question:\n\nTitle: Sleep Disordered Breathing in Precapillary Pulmonary Hypertension: Effect of CPAP Treatment\n\nInclusion criteria are:\n- Minimum 18 years old\n- Diagnosed with PAH or non-operable CTEPH or operated CTEPH with persistent pulmonary hypertension\n- Diagnosis of PAH based on cardiac catheterization\n- Diagnosis of CTEPH confirmed by contrast-enhanced spiral chest CT, pulmonary angiography, and V/Q scintigraphy\n- Recent diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (polysomnography realized within 3 months before inclusion showing AHI above 15)\n- Stable clinical condition for at least 3 months before inclusion as defined by NYHA and a walking distance difference within 10% of the previous 3 months and no change in medical therapy during this 3 months\n\nThe patient in the note is not explicitly stated to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or sleep-disordered breathing. The patient's issue seems to be related to a complication from a cardiac catheterization procedure, with no mention of pulmonary hypertension or sleep disordered breathing. Thus, based on the information provided, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.\n\nTherefore, the trial-level eligibility for this patient would be:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.",
