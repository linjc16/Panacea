        "output": "Based on the patient note provided and the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, the patient does not appear to meet the specific requirements for the clinical trial that focuses on sacroiliac joint pain. The patient presents with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain, which is unrelated to sacroiliac joint pain. Furthermore, there is no mention of unilateral pain near the sacroiliac joint or positive results on sacroiliac joint provocation tests. The symptoms and history given in the patient note suggest a cardiovascular rather than musculoskeletal issue.\n\nTherefore, this patient would not be a suitable candidate for the clinical trial on the effectiveness of the compression belt for patients with sacroiliac joint pain.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.",

        "output": "Based on the patient note and the clinical trial's inclusion criteria, this patient does not appear to be a candidate for the clinical trial in question. The patient presents with symptoms potentially indicative of cardiovascular issues (chest pain, nausea, diaphoresis, and mild dyspnea), while the clinical trial is focused on patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and involves assessing intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations in relation to a specific surgical intervention (Deep Sclerectomy With Collagen Implant).\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the clinical trial specifically mention:\n- Diagnosis of POAG\n- Documented glaucomatous visual field (VF) damage\n- Progressing glaucomatous damage justifying a surgical procedure (DSCI)\n- Age \u226518 years\n- Specific requirements regarding refractive error of the study eye\n\nThe patient note does not indicate that the patient has POAG or any visual field damage. There is no mention of glaucoma or any related treatments, surgeries, or symptoms. The patient's presentation is unrelated to the diseases and conditions being studied in the trial, and there is no information to suggest that she would meet the specific requirements for refractive error, as her visual status is not discussed.\n\nTherefore, the patient would not be referred for this clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.",

        "output": "Based on the information provided in the patient note, the 58-year-old African-American woman presents with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain, hypertension, and obesity. She does not have a history of smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. Her EKG shows nonspecific changes, and there is no mention of inappropriate sinus tachycardia or any heart rate measurements.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the clinical trial on Ivabradine Versus Beta-blockers in the Treatment of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia require a diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia characterized by a heart rate (HR) greater than 100 bpm at rest on an ECG and/or a medium Holter ECG HR greater than 90 bpm, in addition to being over 18 years of age.\n\nGiven that the patient note does not provide any information on the patient's heart rate or a diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia, we cannot conclude that she meets the inclusion criteria based on the data provided. Therefore, further investigation would be needed to assess her heart rate and determine if she has inappropriate sinus tachycardia.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.",
