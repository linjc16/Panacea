Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

        "output": "Patient note:\nA 33-year-old male athlete presented to the ER with acute abdominal pain. Family member says the patient fell off his bike a week earlier and suffered blunt trauma to the left hemi-abdomen, and he has had mild abdominal pain since that day. The patient's history is negative for smoking, drugs, and alcohol. BP: 60/30 mmHg, HR: 140/min. The patient is pale, the physical examination of the abdomen revealed muscle contraction and resistance. Emergency ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen reveal extended intraperitoneal hemorrhage due to spleen rupture.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Distal Pancreatectomy With Partial Splenectomy for Pancreatic Tumors\n\nSummary:\nMost resectable tumors arising in the body or tail of the pancreas are malignancies or premalignancies which are surgically treated with distal pancreatectomy in combination with splenectomy. Retrieval of the lymph node tissue which lies along the splenic vessels is necessary to complete an oncologically sound operation. Two techniques for spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy have been described, but only a small number of lesions are amenable to spleen preserving pancreas surgery because these operation compromise oncologic principles. Removal of a normal spleen usually does not cause immediate consequences but can make patients vulnerable to life threatening infections. Asplenic patients must be vigilant for these infections and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended anytime a fever occurs. Splenectomy results in measurable changes in the cellular components of the blood. If thrombocytosis occurs as a result of splenectomy, it requires life-long antiplatelet treatment. Some childhood hematologic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis are successfully treated with partial splenectomy. The post-surgical remnant spleen has been shown to be viable and functional. Both hematologic and immunologic function of the spleen seems to be preserved in most patients. Partial splenectomy has also been successfully ly employed to treat benign and malignant lesions of the spleen. Unfortunately these indications for surgery are rare and so the experience with partial splenectomy is small. Distal pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy has not been described in the medical literature. The investigators have devised a surgical procedure combining distal pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy, in principal allowing preservation of splenic function without compromise of oncologic principles. This procedure is possible now because of new technology which allows for near bloodless transection of solid organs. These instruments are routinely used in liver, kidney and pancreas surgery. There are scattered reports of successful use of these instruments in splenic transection, but there is no large experience to date. The study intends to answer the question, is the proposed procedure, distal pancreatectomy and partial splenectomy, a viable alternative to the current standard of care, distal pancreatectomy with total splenectomy, for patients who will undergo surgical treatment of pancreas lesions arising in the body or tail of the pancreas?\n\nInclusion criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nPatients with solid or cystic neoplasms of the pancreas who are being considered for distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy to be performed in either an open, laparoscopic, or da Vinci assisted fashion.\nNo evidence of metastatic disease\nNo evidence of local invasion into surrounding organs\nECOG performance status <3\nAge 18 years or greater\nParticipants will provide written informed consent to be part of the study\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Sedation is part of the standard treatment in patients with a TBI and has been proposed as a neuroprotective intervention in head-injured patients. Sedative regimens, such as midazolam and propofol, are not standardized and it is unclear whether sedation has a significant impact on recovery and outcome. A review of propofol versus midazolam in mechanically ventilated patients shows evidence that both provide effective sedation but there is lack of data to support one sedative over the other. Cytokines are released in response to tissue injury and act to generate a variety of physiologic responses. The cytokine elevation has been correlated with the extent of tissue injury. This study will compare the cytokine distribution patterns at specific posttraumatic time points in patients with a TBI sedated with either propofol or midazolam. Additional analysis will compare the cytokine response in patients whom had elevated blood alcohol levels with those with normal levels. Neuropsychological testing will also be performed to determine the extent of brain injury and recovery.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAges 18 Years or older\nMales or Females\nPrimary diagnosis of TBI, subarachnoid hemmorhage (SAH), intracranial hemmorhage (ICH), stroke\nRequires mechanical ventilation\nRequires or is receiving continuous IV sedation\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient meets all the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, so the trial-level eligibility is 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, which may have affected his blad",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nA 21-year-old college student undergoes colonoscopy due to family history of multiple polyps in his older siblings.

Therefore, while the patient may benefit from the use of an abdominal compression elastic support (ACES) to prevent intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH), the study's inclusion criteria require a history of at least two episodes of IDH in the past month.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine, which is not a target disease for this clinical trial.

Poor dietary intake of vitamin K (mainly found in dark green leafy vegetables) is associated with bone loss and fractures. Giving supplements of the main dietary form of vitamin K (called K1) or another common form which our bodies make from K1(called MK4), to improve bone health have given mixed results. This confusion is thought to have arisen because these studies involved people who already had enough vitamin K or did not have osteoporosis. We want to test the hypothesis that treatment with bisphosphonates combined with vitamin K, in vitamin K deplete elderly women with osteoporosis, may offer additional benefit on skeletal metabolism and reduction of fracture risk. We want to test this by measuring vitamin K status in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who are on the recommended treatment with a bisphosphonate and calcium/vitamin D supplements. Those with low vitamin K will then be recruited to study the effect of supplementation with either K1 or MK4.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nInclusion in the cross-sectional part of the study which involves assessment of vitamin K status\nInformed consent to screening stage : assessment of vitamin K status\nserum vitamin K concentration < 0.35 ug/ml\nInclusion into the randomised controlled trial\n1. ambulatory post-menopausal women aged between 55-85 years 2.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nExample trial-level elig",

Appropriate management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the treatment of these cancers. While it is obvious that the positive neck must be treated, controversy has always surrounded the clinically node negative neck with respect to the ideal treatment policy. The situation is difficult with regards to early cancers of the oral cavity (T1/T2). These cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through the per-oral route. Elective neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical procedure with its associated costs, prolonged hospitalization and may be unnecessary in as high as 80% of patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. Should the neck be electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current practice is that the neck is always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to cervical metastasis or when patient follow-up is unreliable.\n\nPrimary Objective:\nTo demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to the wait and watch policy i.e. Therapeutic neck dissection (TND) in the management of the clinically No neck in early T1 /T2 cancers of the oral cavity.\n\nSecondary Objective:\nDoes Ultrasound examination have any role in the routine initial workup of a node negative patient?\nHow are patients ideally followed up - does sonography have a role or is clinical examination sufficient?\nIs assessment of tumor thickness by the surgeon at the time of initial surgery accurate - Is there a correlation?\nIdentify histological prognostic factors in the primary that may help identify a sub-set of patients at an increased risk for cervical metastasis.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nHistologically proven T1 or T2 N0 M0 (clinical) squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, lower alveolus, oral tongue and floor of mouth.\nSurgery is the preferred treatment and the primary tumor can be excised with clear margins via the per-oral route.\nNo history of a prior malignancy in the head and neck region.\nNo prior malignancy outside the head and neck region in the preceding 5 years.\nPatient will be reliable for follow-up\nAge> 18 years and < 75 years.\nNo significant co-morbid conditions - ASA grade II and I.\nUnderstands the protocol and is able to give informed consent.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's lung mass and brain tumor are not related to the clinical trial's inclusion criteria, which focus on early node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and has undergone radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, including radiation and chemotherapy.

SBRT has been in clinical use for over a decade in some institutions and the available data suggest that it can be used safely and with good results. This study will see how effective Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy is for treating tumours in the lung and how often people have side effects. Radiation therapy is usually given once a day, often for a few weeks. In this study, study participants will receive high doses of radiation treatment to tumours in the lung for 3 to 10 treatment sessions over a total of about 1 to 2 weeks. Several reports indicate that this therapy might shrink tumours and control the cancer for extended periods of time. Although specialists started to treat patients with SBRT over 10 years ago, it is still used in relatively few cancer centres.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nHistological confirmation of malignancy, unless the risks of biopsy are unacceptable and the lesion has grown on serial CT scan and/or is PET positive.\nEligible patients must have staging studies (e.g. chest radiograph, CT scan, MRI/CT Brain/Bone Scan) identifying them as:\npatients with stage I or II, non-metastatic NSCLC (T1, N0, M0; T2, N0, M0; or T3, N0, M0 chest wall primary tumors only)\npatients with a non-lung primary that is controlled and which has metastasized to the lungs alone, in whom potentially curative surgery would otherwise be an option (e.g. colorectal, breast, sarcoma\u2026etc)\nthe subset of patients with limited (low) volume metastatic NSCLC or other primary site tumors whom it is felt may derive benefit from highdose SBRT treatment to the primary or metastatic lung tumor. And in whom other sites of metastatic disease are being treated with the desire to achieve long term control.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, including radiation and chemotherapy.

While the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the Natural History of Peripheral Arterial Disease clinical trial, the presence of a history of myocardial infarction and transient ischemic attack may indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular events, which could potentially exclude the patient from other clinical trials focused on peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, it is unlikely that this patient would be highly likely to be referred to this specific clinical trial.\n\nAlternatively, for the clinical trial titled \"Natural History of Peripheral Arterial Disease,\" the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that they may be more appropriate for a clinical trial focused on the progression of peripheral arterial disease, rather than a trial focused on the natural history of the condition. Therefore, it is possible that the patient would be more likely to be referred to a different clinical trial that is better suited to their specific needs and medical condition.\n\nFor the clinical trial titled \"Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis,\" the patient's medical history does not meet the inclusion criteria, as they do not have multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is unlikely that this patient would be referred to this clinical trial.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's medical history and the inclusion criteria of the clinical trials provided, it is most likely that the patient would not be referred to the \"Natural History of Peripheral Arterial Disease\" clinical trial. However, further evaluation and consultation with a healthcare provider would be necessary to determine the most appropriate clinical trial for this patient's specific needs and medical condition.</s>",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe clinical trial is focused on falls and lower urinary tract symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis.

After having treated seven (7) patients, it was decided in April 2007 that the handling characteristics of the test device should be upgraded before continuing the trial as planned. Therefore, the study was long-term interrupted and finally terminated early. This decision was made by the sponsor in full accordance with the principal investigator. Further studies shall be conducted to show effectiveness and safety of the Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device.~_________~Primary Endpoints:~Thrombectomy with the Aspirex catheter device is associated with an immediate decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVP).~The Aspirex thrombectomy catheter does not cause perforation/dissection to treated and untreated cardiovascular structures.~Secondary Endpoints:~Thrombectomy with the Aspirex catheter device is associated with improved flow in the treated main and lobar pulmonary arteries as assessed by the angiographic Miller index.~There will be no significant mechanical haemolysis as assessed by plasma free haemoglobin levels.~In-hospital mortality will not exceed 20%.~Study Design: A prospective international multicenter non-randomized registry assessing the safety and efficacy of the Aspirex 11F mechanical thrombectomy device.~Sample Size: Maximum of 50 patients~Inclusion Criteria:~Patients with massive pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock with failed thrombolysis or at least contraindication for lysis.~Exclusion Criteria:~Systemic embolism in the presence of an arterial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.~Free floating right heart thrombi, left heart thrombi.~Life expectancy, due to underlying disease, less than one month.\n\nTrial-",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, which may affect his bladder function.

Laboratory tests reveal an elevated D-dimer.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Reperfusion of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations After Embolotherapy\n\nSummary: AVMs are abnormal collections of blood vessels which can occur in any part of the body including the lungs. These blood vessels are weakened and can rupture anytime causing bleeding which can be massive, leading to life-threatening conditions. Pulmonary AVMs occur in about 40% of patients with HHT. Each patient may have an average of 5 AVMs .Rupture of the AVM can lead to massive bleeding in the lung, stroke and infection of the brain. In order to prevent these complications, patients with HHT are routinely examined for pulmonary AVMs and treatment with embolization is recommended. Embolization is a standard medical procedure which is done to stop or prevent hemorrhage (bleeding) from an AVM. It involves blocking the artery that supplies blood to the AVM by inserting a foreign body, into the blood vessel supplying blood to the AVM. Standard devices used for embolization include coils (made of stainless steel or platinum). These devices usually have a good success rate for blocking the artery that supplies blood to the AVM. However, a few AVMs that are embolized by standard devices may reopen over time. This is called reperfusion and will require repeat embolization procedures. For embolization of pulmonary AVMs at St. Michael's Hospital, the Nester coil is used. In this study, we would like to compare the Nester coil with a new coil device called the Interlock Fibered IDC Occlusion System. Both coils are approved for use in Canada, however the cost of the IDC coil limits its use at this hospital. Compared to the Nester coil, the IDC coils are made so that they can be removed or repositioned if they are not placed correctly. The coil also allows tighter packing which helps prevent reperfusion. This study will compare the success rate of embolization between the Interlock\u2122 Fibered IDC\u2122 Occlusion System (IDC coil) and the Nester coil.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients are eligible for inclusion in the study if all the following criteria are met:\nDocumented presence of new (untreated) pulmonary AVMs requiring embolization\nDefinite clinical diagnosis of HHT or genetic diagnosis of HHT\nAge \u226518 years\nAble to provide informed consent\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient has recently undergone surgery and is experiencing shortness of breath and malaise.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is not related to the target diseases of the clinical trial.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\n\n\nPatient",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and is currently undergoing treatment for it.

She is now complaining of a cool right foot. Upon examination she has a pulsatile mass in her right groin with loss of distal pulses, and auscultation reveals a bruit over the point at which the right femoral artery was entered.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation\n\nSummary:\nIschaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood clot) can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to restore the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of people making a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices. PISTE is a randomised, controlled trial to test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improves functional outcome in patients with large artery occlusion who are given IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nClinical diagnosis of supratentorial acute ischaemic stroke\nMale or nonpregnant female \u226518 years of age\nClinically significant neurological deficit and NIHSS score \u22656.\nEligible for IV rtPA according to standard guidelines and able to be commenced on IV treatment <4.5h after symptom onset.\nEnrolment, randomisation and procedure commencement (groin puncture) possible within 90 minutes of the start of IV rtPA treatment (groin puncture maximum 5.5h after stroke onset).\nOcclusion of the main middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk, MCA bifurcation or intracranial internal carotid artery(carotidT, M1 or single proximal M2 branch) demonstrated on CTA, MRA, or DSA.\nInterventional device delivery (guide catheter placed beyond aortic arch and angio obtained) can be achieved within 6 hours of onset of the stroke.\nConsent of patient or representative.\nIndependent prior to the stroke (estimated mRS 02)\nExpected to be able to be followed up at 3 months\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is not a target disease for this clinical trial.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent Foley catheterization.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and lower extremity weakness, which are not directly related to the target diseases of the clinical trial.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS. Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Dose-dependent Effects of VAC BNO 1095 on Cyclic Mastodyn",

Surveys of school students in the United States (US) and Europe reported menorrhagia in 37% to 55% of adolescent females. Medical management of adolescent menorrhagia includes various formulations of hormonal therapy and the antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid. Oral tranexamic acid (TA), a more potent antifibrinolytic agent used as standard therapy for menorrhagia in adult women and in adolescent women in Europe and Canada, was not previously available in the US. Subsequent to US FDA approval in November 2009 of a novel oral TA formulation to treat cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding in adult women, this medication is currently included in the treatment armamentarium for adult menorrhagia. There is currently no preliminary data available in the US about the clinical use of oral TA in an exclusive adolescent population with menorrhagia. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are considered standard therapy in the management of menorrhagia in teen-aged women.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the",

She also gets tired easily, has decreased appetite, and has recently tried home remedies for her constipation. Physical examination reveals hyporeflexia with delayed relaxation of knee and ankle reflexes, and very dry skin. She moves and talks slowly.\n\nHere is an example clinical trial: \nTitle: Inhibition of Complement Activation (Eculizumab) in Guillain-Barre Syndrome Study\n\n\nSummary: Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute neuromuscular weakness in the Western World and can occur at any age. GBS is a rpadily progressive 'inflammatory' disorder of the perihperal nerves often leading to sever paresis of the limbs. Most GBS patients also have sensory disturbances (tingling or dull feeling) and pain. Some patients also have double vision or problems with swallowing. GBS mau also involve the respiratory muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. GBS pateints have a vairable prognosis; 20-30% require mechnical ventilation for a period ranging from weeks to months, 20% are unable to walk after 6 months nad 3-5% dies. Progression of weakness in GBS is usually rapid and reaches its peak within 4 weeks in the majority of patients, but many develop their maximum deficit within 2 weeks. Thereafter, the patients have a variable prognosis.\n\nGBS is a treatable disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg administered in 5 days was shown to be effective when administered within the first two weeks after onset of symptoms, and is considered the treatment of choice by most experts in the field. Although the standard treatment for GBS is a single course of IVIg (2g/kg administered in 5 days), many patients fails to recover abd remain with substantial disability. Patients with GBS and especially those with a poor prognosis potentially may benefit from more powerful abd when possible a more mechanistically rational therapy.\n\nRecent experimental evidence suggests that complement activation palys a crucial role in the development of neuromuscular weakness in GBS making complement inhibitors and regulators attracive therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that Eculizumab, with its function as a complement inhibitor, will be very effective in preventing progression of weakness in patients with GBS.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients aged >18 years diagnosed with GBS according to NINDS diagnostic criteria\nOnset of weakness due to GBS is less than 2 weeks ago\nPatients who are unable to walk unaided for >10 metres (grade >3 on GBS disability scale)\nPatients who are being considered for or already on IVIg treatment\nFirst dose of eculizumab must be started within 2 weeks from onset of weakness and any time during the IVIg treatment period\nSigned informed consent\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nReason: The patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and has undergone radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which may affect bladder function and increase the risk of falls.

Nuchal rigidity was found on physical examination.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Ondansetron for Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nSummary:\nBackground: Most patients suffering from mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) present persistent symptoms at one week post injury. A systematic review showed a paucity of studies for short term outcomes following mTBI. Among potential treatments for mTBI, ondansetron has shown promising results based on clinical experience and a single retrospective study.\n\nObjectives:\nThe primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of ondansetron to decrease post concussion symptoms at one week following mTBI in children. More specifically, this pilot study will evaluate the proportion of participants who complete assessment at one week following intervention.\n\nMethod:\nThis will be a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial performed among children aged between 8 and 17 years old who sustained a mTBI in the previous 24 hours. Participants visiting the emergency department will be randomized to receive one dose of either ondansetron or placebo. The primary outcome of interest is defined as an increase from pre-concussion baseline of at least 3 symptoms from the Post Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) one week following trauma. Secondary outcomes will include time to full recovery, mean PCSI score, and outcomes at one month following head trauma. The primary analysis will compare the proportion of participants with persistence of symptoms at one week in both groups. The full study sample size was calculated to have 90% power to detect a decrease in the proportion of persistence of symptoms from 50% to 30% with an alpha value of 0.05. Approximately 126 patients will therefore be recruited in each arm. The investigators plan to recruit 30 participants (10% of the final population) for the pilot study.\n\nExpected results:\nThis pilot study should confirm the feasibility of the randomized controlled trial by showing that 90% of the recruited participants provide data on the primary outcome at one week following intervention. On the long term, the investigator expect that ondansetron will decrease the proportion of patients sustaining persistent symptoms of concussion from 50% to lower than 30%.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nChildren aged between 8 and 17 years old. This will be limited to this small spectrum of age to insure better homogeneity in the evaluation of the participants and streamlining of outcome measures.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and lower extremity weakness, which are not included in the target diseases of this clinical trial.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nPatient note:\nA 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with complaints of progressively worsening dysphagia, drooling, fever and vocal changes.

The parents deny the possibility of foreign body ingestion or trauma, and they report that they are delaying some of his vaccines.\n\nClinical trial: Title: Effect of Surface Electrical Stimulation on Movement of the Larynx\n\nSummary: This study will examine whether surface electrical stimulation on the skin of the throat will: 1) move the larynx (voice box); 2) move the vocal folds in the larynx; and 3) cause less movement of the larynx when applied during swallowing. It is important that the larynx moves up and forward while swallowing so that food does not go into the airway. A device called VitalStim\u00ae (Registered Trademark), which provides electrical stimulation to the skin on the neck and under the chin, is widely used to treat people who have problems swallowing. This study will determine if VitalStim can move the voice box or the vocal folds in the larynx. This information is important for patients who have long-term problems raising or closing their larynxes when they swallow.\n\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nThe Healthy volunteers will be without cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, otolaryngological, psychiatric or speech, swallowing and hearing problems as determined by medical history and examination by a physician.\n\nExclusion criteria:\nHistory of Rheumatic fever, mitral valve prolapse, or cardiac arrhythmias as determined by medical history, physical and EKG. A physician will auscultate for cardiac murmurs prior to any study to exclude volunteers who might be at risk for endocarditis. Subjects will have an EKG as part of the screening for participation in the study.\n\nPregnancy will exclude women from participation because the study involves radiation exposure.\n\nNone of the Healthy volunteers will have a reduction in the range of vocal fold movement during the nasoendoscopy that might suggest laryngeal paralysis or paresis, joint abnormality or neoplasm.\n\nHealthy Volunteers who have a cardiac demand pacemaker, dementia, exhibit non-stop vocalization, significant reflux due to use of a feeding tube, or drug toxicity will not be included for VitalStim, as these are contraindications to use of the device.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nIn this example, both patients are not eligible for the clinical trials based on the given inclusion criteria. The first patient's tumor is located in the spine and is unresectable, which does not meet the inclusion criteria for the first clinical trial. The second patient has a history of delaying some vaccines, which is not specified as an exclusion criterion for the second clinical trial, but the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that they may have a medical condition that would exclude them from participating in the study.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is a type of brain tumor.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine, which is not a target disease for this clinical trial.

This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\n\nExample clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is not a target disease for this clinical trial.

Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. This study will evaluate the efficacy in prevention of persistent HPV-16 or HPV-18 cervical infection lasting at least 6 months, the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix TM ) over 24 months in Japanese adult women aged 20 - 25 years of age at study start.

Two low-cost molecular tests for human HPV, the HPV E6 Test and the careHPV test, have been developed to detect cervical cancer by testing for HPV DNA. These tests take between 2 and 3 hours to run and may provide point-of-care (diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care) testing for HPV. Researchers are interested in evaluating both tests to determine the best strategy for HPV testing of women who live in rural or underserved areas that have a high prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses.\n\nObjectives:~- To evaluate the clinical performance of the HPV E6 Test and careHPV in detecting cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.\n~- To evaluate the best low-cost test or combination of tests for women who have been referred for cervical cancer screening or treatment.\n~- To compare the clinical performance of self-collected specimens versus clinician-collected specimens in detecting cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.\n\nEligibility:~- Women between 25 and 65 years of age who live in rural China.\n~- Design:~This study involves an initial testing visit and a 1-year followup visit for a high-risk subgroup.\n~- Participants will have the HPV E6 test, careHPV, and a visual inspection test for cervical cancer. For comparison, participants will also have the standard HPV test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n~- Participants who test positive for HPV on any of the above tests will also have colposcopy to collect samples of cervical tissue for further study.\n~- A random sample of women who test negative for HPV will also have colposcopy. Participants may also have biopsies if there is visual evidence of cervical abnormalities.\n~- At the 1-year followup visit, participants in the high-risk subgroup will have the same tests as in the previous visit.\n\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nhave not been previously diagnosed with cervical cancer\nhave a cervix\nare not pregnant\nare physically able to undergo routine cervical cancer screening\nare able to provide informed consent\n\nWe will not exclude women if they have had previous cervical cancer screening because we assume that even if a few women have been screened for cervical cancer, the quality of cytology screening was very poor.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n1) are not married AND report never having had sexual intercourse\n2) have had a total hysterectomy\n3) have a history of cervical cancer\n4) are physically or mentally unable to undergo routine cervical cancer screening or unable to provide informed consent.\n5) are pregnant or have been pregnant in the last month\n-Women who are currently menstruating at the time of enrollment will be deferred from participating, and will become eligible to participate 7-14 days after menstruation has ended. The menstruating women will be advised to return for the screening 7 to 14 days after their menstrual period has concluded.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and lower urinary tract symptoms due to anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine.

Significant physical exam findings include bibasilar lung crackles, pitting ankle edema and jugular venous distension.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Resynchronization Therapy in Young Patients With and Without CHD\n\nSummary:\nPacemakers can be attached to one or more than one of the heart chambers. After watching pacemakers work over time, doctors have found that the pacemakers that stimulate only one chamber of the heart sometimes lead to problems later. These problems may be changes in the size and shape of the heart. The heart cannot work as well when some of these changes happen. We need to learn more about these changes and how to prevent them. There has not been an easy way to do this. A new treatment called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is associated with biventricular pacing where two chambers of the heart are stimulated simultaneously. Tissue Doppler Imaging,Tissue Synchronization Imaging and 3 dimensional echocardiography are new forms of technology that look at the heart while it works. They are similar to a moving x-ray that can watch the heart muscles moving. The movement can be measured. Doctors will check for changes that happen over time. This has not been studied in children before because this kind of is new to this group of patients. This technology is noninvasive which means it can be done from the outside of the body and is painless.\n\nThe hearts of children grow fast. It is important to be able to know if the pacemaker or problems from dilated cardiomyopathy are causing any changes in the heart that might cause problems. We expect to be able to use information we learn from this study to improve how we use pacemakers in the future to avoid problems that can happen over time.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nDiagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy\nnormal heart anatomy or those with repaired congenital defects that have a 4 chambered heart\nreferred for a Biventricular pacemaker implantation or upgrade with the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy or for an echocardiogram due to the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy without pacemaker\nsigned informed consent\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets all the inclusion criteria, so the trial-level eligibility is 2, which means the patient is highly likely to be referred to the clinical trial.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and lower extremity weakness, which are not included in the target diseases of the clinical trial.

The investigators hypothesized that HIIT modality will lead to a larger improvement in physical fitness (i.e. VO2peak), cardiovascular parameters (cardiac output and stroke volume) and cognitive performance at rest and during submaximal exercise. The primary endpoint will be the improvement in cognitive performance.\n\nInclusion criteria: Elderly healthy subjects : with no MetS and no-documented CHD, both males and females, aged>60 years will be included in the study, should they provide written informed consent and have a sufficient initial physical and intellectual capacities allowing an independent daily living.\nPatients with metabolic syndrome and no-documented CHD, both males and females, aged > 18 years will be included in the study, should they provide written informed consent and have a sufficient initial physical and intellectual capacities allowing an independent daily living.

The effect is dose-dependent. Nevertheless, dosages are suboptimal. European Guidelines 2012 recommend close monitoring and up-titration of drugs by HF nurses. Trials are needed to evaluate their effectiveness and safety. Objective: To compare doses achieved by patients of BB, ACEI, ARB II and MRA in 4 months ( % relative to target doses) in the intervention group (HF nurse) and in the control group ( cardiologist), adverse events, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), New York Heart Association (NYHA), 6 min. walking test, quality of life, Nt-proBNP, readmissions and mortality. Hypothesis: Non-inferiority. Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. New (de novo) HF patients with LVEF \u2264 40%, NYHA II-III, without contraindications to BB of 17 Spanish hospitals will be included. Intervention: The cardiologist prescribes drugs and, driven by protocol, the HF nurse implements the up-titration. In the control group doses are decided by the cardiologist clinical support and education being provided by nurses. Variables: age, sex, education, psycho-social level, Cardio Vascular Risk Factors (CVRF), NYHA, LVEF, ischemic cardiopathy., N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP), 6min. walking test, Creatinine/Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), Potassium (K), haemoglobin, Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR), mg./drug, European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale (EHFScBS), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ), European Quality of life Scale (EQ-5D). Expected Results: If our hypothesis were confirmed, evidence would be provided on the effectiveness of this healthcare management, that could be economically evaluated in future studies. A qualitative study also will be undertaken to explore barriers and facilitators to implementation\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatient with de novo heart Failure and LVEF <= 40% admitted in hospital, without contraindications for BB prescription with cardiologist up-titration prescription and without having achieved BB target dose previous discharge and signing informed consent.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

However, some concerns remain about using systemic steroids for all patients with acute exacerbation. Their short-term advantages may be outweighed by the occurrence of adverse side effects such as hyperglycemia, which is difficult to manage on an outpatient basis. In this context, the possibility of treating patients with COPD exacerbation with inhaled steroids having less systemic adverse effects is interesting. The objectives are to compare relapse rate, lung function, the severity of dyspnea and, systemic and sputum inflammatory markers in outpatients with acute COPD exacerbations treated with fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair\u00ae) or oral prednisone for 10 days. The hypothesis is that Advair\u00ae is as effective as prednisone in treatment of outpatients with COPD exacerbation. The primary endpoint is to determine if the relapse rate at one month is equivalent for both treatments. The secondary endpoints are to compare lung function and dyspnea score and, systemic and sputum inflammatory markers modulation after 10 days of both treatments. We will recruit 30 outpatients in each group from our COPD clinic. Patients will receive prednisone (40mg/day) with placebo diskus or Advair\u00ae 50/500ug 2 inhalations bid (twice the regular dose) with placebo pills for 10 days. All patients will receive antibiotics and short-acting bronchodilators as needed. We expect to demonstrate that the improvement of lung function, dyspnea, inflammatory markers and relapse rate are equivalent in both treatments suggesting that Advair\u00ae could be a good alternative to prednisone for patients with steroid-induced hyperglycemia.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\ndiagnosis of COPD\nhistory of 15 pack-years or more of cigarette smoking\nevidence of irreversible obstruction (FEV1<70% of predicted value, ratio FEV1/FVC<70%, and improvement of FEV1of less than 20% after bronchodilator in previous respiratory tests done when they were stable)\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nReason: The patient has a history of urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, which may affect the results of the study as it is not related to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).\n```\n\nIn",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and is currently undergoing treatment for it.

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and lower extremity weakness, which are not included in the target diseases of the clinical trial. Additionally, the patient's Expanded Disability Status Scale score is not between 1 and 6.5, which is an inclusion criterion for the clinical trial.\n```\n\n```\nPatient note:\nA 66yo female with significant",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

Frequently, trastuzumab is being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However, since therapy with trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC, the optimal treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression, chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further line therapies are performed according to the physician's discretion.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

Theoretically, CMV-specific cell-mediate immune response before and after bone marrow transplantation will further categorize the patients into high or low risk of CMV development after bone marrow transplantation. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in bone marrow transplant candidates to predict the development of CMV infection after transplantation.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nage 16 or more\nagree with written informed consent\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient is on immunosuppressive medications, including prednisone, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections such as CMV. However, the patient already has evidence of CMV infection based on the owl's eye inclusion bodies found in BAL fluid. Therefore, it is unlikely that this patient would benefit from participating in a clinical trial aimed at predicting CMV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients. The trial-level eligibility is 0, indicating that the patient would not be referred for this clinical trial.</s>",

The annual incidence of HT worldwide is estimated to be 0.8 - 3.5 cases per 1000 persons. The thyroid gland attacked by a variety of cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes. Various auto-antibodies may be present against TPO and Tg, and ADCC is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of HT. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-cells is central to thyrocyte destruction. Recent studies showed higher pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum of patients with HT, and suggested HT is associated with regulatory T-cells dysfunction, imbalance of ratio of Th1 cell and Th2 cell, overexpression of Th17 cells.\n\nSeveral studies suggested that pregnant women with HT, even at euthyroid state had higher risk of spontaneous miscarriage, more frequent post-partum depression and higher depressive, anger, and total mood disturbance risk compared to those without HT. Presence of thyroid auto-antibodies is also associated with negative pregnant outcomes including gestational hypertension, late abortion, fetal death, premature delivery and neonatal respiratory distress. Neonates from mothers with ATD have higher rate of transient hypothyroidism. Children of mothers with ATD had higher risk of positive serum thyroid auto-antibodies and development of goiter and thyroid dysfunction. However, there is no suggested treatment for subjects with HT who have normal thyroid function. Low-iodine diet and regularly follow-up were suggested.\n\nPlaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is an anti-malarial agent, and has been used to treat several autoimmune diseases, including lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis for more than a century. It reduced lymphocytes, production of auto-antibodies, cytokines, and immune mediators, NK cell activity, and inhibits antigens presenting to CD4 T-cells of B cells, dendritic cells and monocytes.\n\nThis study focuses on the effect of Plaquenil on thyroid auto-antibodies, inflammatory markers, cytokines, and goiter size in euthyroid women with HT.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n- Newly diagnosed (within 1 year) Hashimoto's thyroiditis by positive serum anti-TPO antibody or anti-thyroglobulin antibody\n- Euthyroid state by serum free T4 and TSH level within normal limit\n\nExclusion criteria:\n- Pregnant, planning pregnant within 1 year, or lactating women\n- Renal insufficiency, abnormal liver function test\n- Hematologic diseases: anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia\n- G6PD deficiency, porphyria cutanea tarda\n- Allergy to 4-aminoquinoline compounds\n- Known retinopathy or visual field defect disorders\n- Already receive immunosuppression therapy\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent Foley catheterization.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone radiation therapy and chemotherapy for anaplastic astrocytoma, which may have affected his blad",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nReason: The patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and has undergone radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which may have an impact on bladder function and increase the risk of falls.

She denies difficulty sleeping and sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. She also notes hair loss, a change in her voice and weight gain during the previous 6 months. She complains of cold intolerance. On examination she has a prominent, soft, uniform anterior cervical mass at the midline.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: The GlasVEGAS Study (Glasgow Visceral & Ectopic Fat With Weight Gain in South AsianS)\n\nSummary:\nSouth Asians have a much higher risk of diabetes compared to Europeans and investigators don't know why this is. Investigators think that South Asians' capacity to store fat safely under the skin is lower than Europeans, so they start to store fat around internal organs and in liver and muscle, and at lower body weights than Europeans. These increased levels of internal fat storage are thought to increase risk of diabetes.\n\nThe purpose of the study therefore is to investigate whether there are differences with weight gain and weight loss in fat storage, fat cell function and metabolic risk factors, in South Asians compared with Europeans. Investigators will compare South Asian and European men at the start of the study, after they have gained about 7% body weight, and again after they have lost 7-15% body weight (from peak weight) to see how gaining and losing weight affects fat storage within the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also assess the effect of weight gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nParticipants will be men of European (self-report of both parents of white European origin) or South Asian (self-report of both parents of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Sri Lankan origin) with BMI <25 kg.m-2, who have been weight stable (\u00b1 2 kg) for >6 months.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient's BMI is below the inclusion criteria of 25 kg.m-2, and she has not reported any difficulty sleeping or significant weight loss, which could indicate metabolic disorders. However, the prominent anterior cervical mass could be a sign of an underlying condition that may exclude her from the study. The trial's focus on weight gain and weight loss in South Asians and Europeans does not seem to directly relate to the patient's presentation. Nevertheless, based on her BMI and weight stability, she appears to meet the inclusion criteria and could potentially benefit from the study's findings on fat storage and metabolic risk factors.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and underwent a Foley catheter.

This study provides a unique opportunity for comparison of daily and intermittent therapy for HIV patients with pulmonary TB looking into multiple dimensions of HIV-TB treatment namely efficacy, drug resistance, toxicity , drug interaction and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The primary outcome of the study is to compare the efficacy of three anti-TB regimens in a) reducing bacteriological failures and b) decreasing the emergence of Acquired Rifampicin Resistance (ARR).

Hematological patients are the most affected group. IA has a very high morbimortality due to its rapid progression and because it is very difficult to be early diagnosed. Diagnosis is used to be done too late or even post-mortem.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, which may affect his bladder function and increase his risk of falls",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and has undergone multiple treatments for his anaplastic astrocytoma, which could potentially affect his bladder function and increase",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of urinary retention and lower urinary tract symptoms, but the clinical trial is specifically looking for people with multiple sclerosis and lower urinary tract symptoms.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExample:\nThe patient's history of anaplastic astrocytoma and severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention, as well as the presence of urinary incontinence, would make him inel",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe patient's history of anaplastic astrocytoma and the use of CPT-11 and Avastin may affect the severity of LUTSs and increase the risk of falls, making the patient ineligible for this clinical trial.\n```\n\n```\nExample",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is not a target disease for this clinical trial.

Fecal occult blood is negative.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: The Role of Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Alkaloids in E-Cigarette Use and Dependence\n\n\nSummary: The advent of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) technologies represents one of the most significant developments in the last several decades, and provides a novel and promising strategy for substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking. However, serious concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that e-cigarettes will sustain a dependency on nicotine and that they may lead to continued use of conventional cigarettes known to be extremely harmful to health. Cigarette addiction critically involves a dependence on nicotine, but it is likely that other tobacco constituents contribute to dependence as well. Recent evidence suggests that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids, or NNTAs (including anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine, and myosmine) may play a role in tobacco dependence. These alkaloids have been shown to augment the reinforcing effects of nicotine in animal models and to affect cravings in human smokers. E-cigarettes contain variable quantities of nicotine and NNTAs, but there is virtually no information available concerning the role of e-cigarette nicotine or NNTA content in influencing the concurrent use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, when smokers attempt to switch from conventional combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Additionally, it is not known whether the presence of nicotine and NNTAs in e-cigarettes may sustain dependence, making it difficult to relinquish these products. The proposed project will assess the acceptability, extent of switching behavior, and degree of dependence maintained when smokers are provided with e-cigarettes containing nicotine and NNTAs.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHave no known serious medical conditions;\nAre 21-65 years old;\nSmoke an average of at least 10 cigarettes per day;\nHave smoked at least one cumulative year;\nHave an expired air CO reading of at least 10ppm;\nAre able to read and understand English. Potential subjects must agree to use acceptable contraception during their participation in this study. Potential subjects must agree to avoid the following during their participation in this study:\nParticipation in any other nicotine-related modification strategy outside of this protocol;\nUse of tobacco products other than cigarettes, including pipe tobacco, cigars, snuff, and chewing tobacco;\nUse of e-cigarettes other than the ones provided during the study;\nUse of experimental (investigational) drugs or devices;\nUse of illegal drugs.\n\nBased on the inclusion criteria, the patient's trial-level eligibility is: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n```</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not",

Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as a specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the severity of LUTSs and the risk of falling in PwMS. Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patients were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturitions by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical tests with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between the severity of LUTSs and the occurrence of falls during the past three months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence). The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between the severity of LUTSs and the occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\n\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\n\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, which is not an inclusion criterion for the clinical trial.
