Based on this cancer incidence and survival data, the most promising current strategy for improving outcome is screening and early detection. It is suggested that if lesions are discovered at an earlier stage of disease, they will have a higher likelihood of being treatable and therefore, survival will be improved. CT detection of growing small lung nodules, many of which are non-cancerous (benign), raises the possibility of lung cancer and thus causes anxiety in patients and referring clinicians. Unfortunately, confident separation of benign from malignant small lung nodules cannot be reliably achieved using CT or PET criteria. Pathologic diagnosis using needle or excision biopsy is usually required.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* All newly diagnosed patients with small lung nodules < 1cm that require excision with no history of prior ipsilateral thoracotomy.\n* The nodules must be located in parts of the lung that are amenable to thoracoscopic wedge excision of the nodules.\n* The external surface of the lesion must be at least 2 cm from the major pulmonary arteries, veins, and main bronchi to allow safe and adequate thoracoscopic excision of the lesion.\n* Patients must be mentally competent to give written, informed consent\n* Patients must be capable of independently completing standard English-language QOL instruments.\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\nBased on the patient note and clinical trial information, the trial-level eligibility for this patient would be:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

The elevated D-dimer on laboratory tests also supports this diagnosis. However, the patient's recent surgery and current bedridden status may make it difficult to accurately assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using bedside ultrasound. Additionally, the patient's age (56 years old) and the fact that she is on the 20th day post-left mastectomy surgery may not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, which requires patients to be at least 18 years old and have a suspected DVT.

She denies trauma. On examination she is pale and in moderate discomfort, as well as tachypneic and tachycardic. Her body temperature is normal and her blood pressure is 80/60. Her right arm has no discoloration or movement limitation.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: HEAVy HAT-HEAlthy Volunteers Heart to Arm Time. Haemorrhage Simulation Protocol in Healthy Volunteers\n\nSummary: In prehospital settings, hypovolemic shock diagnosis is based on Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) shock classification. The most often used clinical signs are heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, neurologic status, diuresis, skin colour and temperature. However, some of these signs, such as hypotension and tachycardia, lack specificity and sensitivity and do not occur early enough. Even with an early preload reduction, blood pressure can remain constant due to compensatory mechanisms, such as vasoconstriction and positive chronotropism. Tachycardia occurs earlier, but has poor specificity and sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of 25,287 trauma patients showed that among 489 patients presenting with systolic BP < 90 mmHg, only 65% had tachycardia (HR > 90 bpm), while 39% of patients with systolic BP > 120 mmHg were tachycardic, probably resulting from other stimuli influencing heart rate, such as pain, fear, circulating hormones and endogenous enkephalins. Therefore, it could be very useful to have an index that identifies initial volume variation, when physiological regulatory mechanisms are still effectively maintaining normal BP.\n\nPulse transit time (PTT) is the sum of pre-ejection period (PEP; the time interval between the onset of ventricular depolarization and ventricular ejection) and vascular transit time (VTT; the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel from the aortic valve to peripheral arteries). PEP and VTT variations depend on preload variation, and PTT increases with PEP, showing a linear correlation (R2 = 0.96). Chan et al. subjected 11 healthy volunteers to the head-up tilt test, and demonstrated that PEP increased and VTT decreased for increasing tilt angles from 0\u00b0 to 80\u00b0, corresponding to light-moderate bleeding. They also observed early sympathetic activation, expressed by decreases of both RR interval (RR) and VTT, dampening the PTT increase, since PTT is influenced by both continuous PEP increase and progressive VTT decrease occurring during hypovolaemia.\n\nHere the investigators describe a new index, called indexed Heart to Arm Time (iHAT). iHAT is the mPTT/RR ratio, where mPTT is a modified PTT, measured from the onset of ventricular depolarization (the 'R' wave of the ECG trace) to the systolic peak of the photoplethysmographic pulse oxymetry (PPG) waveform. mPTT is indexed to RR interval on ECG to counteract sympathetic activation that would dampen PEP increase and enhance VTT reduction, by means of positive inotropism and peripheral vasoconstriction, respectively. iHAT therefore increases during haemorrhage because of preload reduction and the consequent PEP increase and RR interval decrease. iHAT is expressed as the time percentage of the interbeat interval (RR) it takes to the PPG waveform to travel to peripheral arteries. In this study iHAT has been calculated as the average of beat-to-beat mPTT/RR ratios over 30 heart beats (corresponding to at least 2 breathing cycles) in order to minimize the effect of spontaneous breathing on preload, and thus on PEP and PTT.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 30 healthy volunteers with no assumption of coffee or",
