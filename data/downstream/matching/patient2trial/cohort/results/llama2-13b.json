Admission to the ICCU with ACS (non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome or 24 hours after ST elevation myocardial infarction): The patient is admitted to the ICCU with ACS, so this criterion is met.\n3. Presence of ischemic symptoms (\u22655 minutes) during hospitalization: The patient presents with ischemic symptoms (episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain) that have been present for at least 5 minutes, so this criterion is met.\n4. Pain assessment of 3 out of 10 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 1 or dynamic ECG findings (ST segment deviation \u22650.05 mV or T wave inversion \u2265 0.3 mV): The patient's pain assessment is not specified in the patient note, so we cannot determine if this criterion is met.\n5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent according to the regulations of the Ministry of Health and the Helsinki committee instructions: The patient's willingness and ability to provide informed consent are not specified in the patient note, so we cannot determine if this criterion is met.\n\nBased on the above assessment, the patient does not meet all of the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.

The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n\nBased on the patient note, we can see that the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and obesity, and she is presenting with new-onset anterior chest pain. This would not make her eligible for the clinical trial, as the trial is focused on patients with coronary artery disease, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. Therefore, I would rate the patient's eligibility as 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nNow, let's review the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Effect of Amlodipine on Anti-platelet Drug Effect in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease\n\nSummary: Clopidogrel can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting platelet aggregation. It is metabolized to an active drug by a liver enzyme. Its efficacy may be measured by blood sampling for platelet activity, analyzed by VerifyNow device. Calcium Channel blocker (CCB) is also commonly used for blood pressure and anginal control in these patients. Dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker (e.g. amlodipine) inhibits this enzyme. There are observational studies reporting dihydropyridine CCB reducing clopidogrel effect, but the clinical implication is unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that there is no significant effect of dihydropyridines CCB on clopidogrel response compared with control.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Ischemic heart disease patient\n* Given loading or maintenance dose of clopidogrel and in need of it for 1 or more month\n* In need of additional drug for optimal BP control (aim blood pressure <130/90) or angina control.\n\nBased on the patient note, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. The patient does not have ischemic heart disease, and she is not currently taking clopidogrel or any other medications for blood pressure or angina control. Therefore, I would rate the patient's eligibility as 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nHowever, if the patient were to be diagnosed with ischemic heart disease and prescribed clopidogrel for treatment, and she were to meet the other inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, her eligibility rating would be 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

She is currently not taking any medications.\n\nNow, let's review the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Study to Assess Efficacy of Nicorandil+Atenolol vs Atenolol in Treatment of Chronic Stable Angina.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients of chronic stable angina with abnormal Exercise Myocardial Perfusion Spect Scan with reversible and partially reversible ischemic changes.\n* Male and female\n* Age 25 to 65 years\n* Patient must understand and be willing, able, and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions and comprehends the diary cards.\n* Patient must be able to give voluntary written informed consent.\n\nNow, let's assess the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial based on the inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patient has a history of episodic chest pain, which is a symptom of chronic stable angina.\n2. The patient has abnormal Exercise Myocardial Perfusion Spect Scan with reversible and partially reversible ischemic changes, which meets the inclusion criterion of having abnormal scan results.\n3. The patient is within the age range of 25 to 65 years.\n4. The patient is a male or female.\n5. The patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures and restrictions and comprehends the diary cards.\n6. The patient is able to give voluntary written informed consent.\n\nBased on the above assessment, I would rate the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial as:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe patient meets all the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, and there are no exclusion criteria that would preclude the patient from participating. Therefore, it is highly likely that the patient would be eligible to participate in the clinical trial.</s>",

This increases risk of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.~LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance are present.~Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform non-invasive tests to measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.~This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Aged 18 years or over\n* Participant willing and able to give informed consent.\n* Documented Ischaemic Heart Disease: either angio-graphically documented coronary artery disease or a previous history of myocardial infarction/angina.\n* Screening echocardiography based diagnosis of LVH (LV mass indexed to height to the allometric power of 1.7; males > 81g/h1.7, females >60g/h1.7)\n* Fasting insulin resistance index \u2265 2.7 AND/OR HbA1c >5.6 and less than 6.5 at screening\n* Blood pressure < 140/85 mm Hg or 24hr BP <135/85 daytime average in screening\n* Able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements.\n\nNow, let's assess the trial-level eligibility for the patient:\n\nBased on the patient's history of episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain, radiating to the back, and accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, and mild dyspnea, this patient may have angina or myocardial infarction, which meets the inclusion criterion of documented ischaemic heart disease.

Clinical Trial:\n\nThe clinical trial is titled \"Stenting Versus Best Medical Treatment of Asymptomatic High Grade Carotid Artery Stenosis.\"\n\n3. Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the clinical trial are:\n\n* Atherosclerosis is the underlying disease\n* Patients with an asymptomatic stenosis >80% (NASCET) with a documented progression of the degree of stenosis to >80% within 6 months with a very tight stenosis \u226590% at initial presentation with a >80% stenosis plus silent ipsilateral ischemia documented by CCT or MRI with ipsilateral >80% stenosis plus contralateral >80% stenosis or occlusion with >80% stenosis plus planned major surgery\n* Neurologist's explicit consent to potentially perform CAS\n\n4. Assessment of Eligibility:\n\nBased on the patient note and clinical trial information, I would assess the patient's eligibility as follows:\n\n* The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of cardiac catheterization and a current complaint of a cool right foot, which may be related to the recent procedure.\n* The patient has a pulsatile mass in the right groin and loss of distal pulses, which suggests the presence of a stenosis or occlusion in the right femoral artery.\n* The patient's symptoms are not specifically related to carotid artery stenosis, but rather to the recent cardiac catheterization procedure.\n* The patient's age (67 years old) and the presence of a pulsatile mass in the right groin are both inclusion criteria for the clinical trial.\n* However, the patient's symptoms are not silent ischemia, and the patient has not been diagnosed with atherosclerosis, which are both requirements for inclusion in the clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, as they do not have silent ischemia and have not been diagnosed with atherosclerosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not related to carotid artery stenosis, but rather to the recent cardiac catheterization procedure.</s>",
