In case of unknown time of symptom onset: time between last seen in healthy condition and first CCT \u2264 12 hours.\n- Therapy receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKA)\n- International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2265 2\n- Signed informed consent form, or signed informed consent by a legal representative, judicial consent in cases where no legal representative is available in time, or consent of an independent physician familiar with the indication in cases where the first three possibilities can not be realized.\n\n3) Compare the patient note and inclusion criteria:\n\n- The patient's age (85 years) is outside the typical age range for clinical trials, which may be a concern for the trial investigators.\n- The patient's symptoms do not mention ICH, SDH, or a diagnosis by CT scanning.\n- The patient's history of a car accident does not necessarily indicate VKA therapy or an elevated INR.\n- The patient's normal head CT result from 3 weeks prior does not provide information about the current INR or the presence of ICH or SDH.\n\n4) Trial-level eligibility:",

She also has normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, a positive ANA and anti-dsDNA, and positive urine for protein and RBC casts.
