Patients who have undergone an emergency cesarian section will be randomly allocated to either the brief computerized intervention or usual care within the first 6 hours following the operation. Participants will be followed up at one week and one month.

On examination he is in respiratory distress and has bronchial respiratory sounds on the left. A chest x-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates.\n\nTitle: Transmission and the Respiratory Tract in Cryptosporidiosis\n\nSummary:\nCryptosporidium is an intestinal parasite that causes diarrhea in children and adults. In addition to infection of the stomach, this parasite can infect the respiratory system causing a cough and/or problems breathing. This study will enroll 480 children between the ages of 9 and 36 months who come to Mulago Hospital for treatment of diarrhea. Researchers believe a large number of children with diarrhea and cough will have the parasite present in their sputum (mucus coughed up). Researchers also believe that children who have respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis may have a cough, increased number of breaths per minute, and/or a lower oxygen level. Blood, stool, saliva, and sputum samples will be collected from all children in the study and tested for Cryptosporidium. Children too young to provide a sputum sample will have a tube placed to collect a mucus sample from the lungs. Study participation may be as short as 4 hours or as long as 2 days depending on each child's health.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Male and female children aged 9-36 months at the time of enrollment\n2.

Immunosuppressive treatment requirement - The patient has a history of alopecia and a rash on the bridge of her nose and cheeks, suggesting possible cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Based on the given patient note, the following trial-level eligibility can be determined:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe clinical trial in question is a study focused on analyzing the effects of a diabetes-specific enteral formula compared to a standard formula supplemented with protein in critically ill patients in a neurological intensive care unit (ICU). The primary objective of the trial is to determine if the difference in mean blood glucose and glycemic variability between the control and intervention groups for up to 14 days while the patient is in the ICU and receiving tube feeds is significant.\n\nBased on the patient note provided, the patient appears to be a suitable candidate for the study. The patient is an 8-year-old boy who has experienced a head injury resulting in a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and impaired movement in his right upper and lower extremities. This condition is within the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, as patients with critical illness, including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, epidural/subdural bleeds, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are eligible.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's age falls within the acceptable range of 18 to 89 years old. The patient also has a GCS score of 6/15, which indicates that he is critically ill and may require tube feeds to manage his nutritional needs. \n\nHowever, it is essential to note that hyperglycemia is not an inclusion criterion in this trial. While the patient's head injury may cause hyperglycemia, it is not the primary reason for his eligibility in the study.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, the patient is highly likely to be referred to this clinical trial. Referring this patient to the study could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of diabetes-specific enteral formulas versus standard formulas in managing blood glucose levels in critical ill patients, which may contribute to",

She is otherwise asymptomatic and has a neurologic examination that is unremarkable but a CT scan of the head shows a solitary mass in the right frontal lobe.\n\nThe provided clinical trial aims to evaluate the use of thoracic US in the post-operative setting following thoracic surgery for any indication. However, the patient's lung cancer diagnosis and the need for a chest x-ray and a CT scan indicate that she is not undergoing elective, open, and thoracoscopic thoracic surgery for any indication as per the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial.\n\nTherefore, it is important to further evaluate the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial based on other criteria mentioned in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The other criteria that could be relevant in this case include the location and size of the lung mass, the patient's overall health, and any previous surgeries or treatments.\n\nIf we assume that the location and size of the lung mass are not relevant, and the patient's overall health and previous surgeries/treatments are acceptable, then the patient may be eligible for the clinical trial.

These anomalies are favored by the presence of peripheral neuropathy and plasma levels of advanced glycation end products higher than in diabetic subjects without bone abnormalities. The objectives of this research are to evaluate these anomalies quantitative and qualitative bone in the foot (calcaneus and ankle) through the use of MicroScanner. In parallel a whole body bone mineral density (BMD) and calcaneal ultrasound will be performed to measure bone mineral density as realized in clinical practice in a defined population of patients with type 1 or type 2. These bone abnormalities will be correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy and the rate of advanced glycation end products of proteins and reference to parameters of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to better understand the pathophysiology and target a population at risk. The importance of this study is paramount in the management of diabetic foot. Indeed for the moment we are dealing primarily the consequences of diabetes impact bone when bone deformities have appeared with their attendant disability and the risk of recurrent infections in areas of friction in this fragile environment. The ultimate goal is to target people with diabetes have abnormal bone subclinical and take care to avoid changes to bone deformities and find ways to treat them. \n\nInclusion criteria: \nAdult with type 1 or 2 diabetes with or without neuropath",

In any case, it is still possible that the patient received the transfusion within 12 hours of admission. Therefore, this criterion is not definitively met.\n\nStep 4: Documented HCT drop of at least 6% from baseline\nWe do not have a baseline HCT value, so we cannot determine if there has been a drop of at least 6%.

Here's the reasoning behind that decision:\n\n1. Severity of symptoms: The patient complains of severe premenstrual and menstrual pelvic pain, as well as heavy and irregular periods, which could indicate adenomyosis. While not a definitive diagnosis, the patient's symptoms are consistent with the disease.\n2. Dysmenorrhea: The patient reports experiencing dysmenorrhea, and this can be a significant symptom of adenomyosis. However, the severity of dysmenorrhea may need to be evaluated further to meet the inclusion criteria.\n3. Age: The patient is 38 years old, which fits within the age range for the trial (20-45 years old).\n4. Medical history: The patient has had two years of infertility treatment and an ectopic pregnancy at age 26, which suggests a history of reproductive issues. Adenomyosis can impact fertility, so this medical history may need to be further evaluated to meet the inclusion criteria.\n5. Imaging results: While the patient's ultrasonographic and Doppler examination have not been specifically mentioned, further imaging may be necessary to diagnose adenomyosis. Imaging is a requirement for the trial, and a diagnosis of adenomyosis based on imaging results may need to be confirmed before the patient can be included in the trial.\n6. Planning for birth spacing: The patient has not mentioned any plans for birth spacing, but a lack of contraception could make this a relevant issue for the trial.\n7. Living in a nearby area: The patient's location in relation to the trial site needs to be considered, but it's not clear from the patient note whether this is the case.\n\nOverall, while the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest adenomyosis, further evaluation may be necessary to meet the inclusion criteria for the LNG-IUS clinical trial. It's important to note that considering a patient for a trial does not guarantee their inclusion.

However, the patient's gender and age do not meet the inclusion criteria. Still, considering that MS is prevalent in women and often diagnosed in the 20s-50s, this patient could be a good fit for the trial. MS symptoms are not directly related to ankle sprains, but the underlying inflammation and pain management strategies could be beneficial for both conditions. The presence of hyporeflexia and dry skin also point towards an underlying medical condition that could be worth studying in a clinical trial.\n\nThe specific treatment being evaluated in the trial, neurocryostimulation, is a relatively new and promising method for treating MS and other neurological disorders. While there is limited evidence on the use of neurocryostimulation in the context of ankle sprains, the combination of pain management techniques could be beneficial for these patients.\n\nIn conclusion, although the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the trial specifically, the underlying medical condition and the promising nature of the treatment warrant further investigation.</s>",

However, the patient's age may be considered a factor that could affect his eligibility. As a general rule, children under the age of 5 are considered more sensitive to medication and may have fewer opportunities for research participation due to their developing bodies and the difficulties that they may have in understanding the study's requirements. Therefore, based on these factors, it can be concluded that the patient may have a lower likelihood of being referred for the clinical trial.\n\nThe patient has a history of allergic rhinitis, which is not mentioned in the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. However, the patient's history of allergies does not exclude him from participation in the study, as it is possible that allergies may contribute to the development of pulmonary vascular disease.\n\nThe patient was referred to the clinic for assessment of possible pulmonary hypertension, which meets the inclusion criteria for the study.

Significant physical exam findings include bibasilar lung crackles, pitting ankle edema, and jugular venous distension.\n\nTitle: Microvascular Blood Flow in Sickle Cell Anemia\n\nClinical Trial Summary:\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. Sickle-shaped cells can cause problems by getting stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow, and causing inflammation and injury to important body parts. There are no specific treatments that improve this condition and promote blood flow hindered by sickle cell blockages. Another big challenge in managing sickle cell disease is that there are no good measures to determine changes and improvements in blood flow. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) is a technique that is currently used to detect blood flow in the heart, muscles, and other organs.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nRegadenoson ARM:\n\n* Diagnosis of sickle cell anemia confirmed by hemoglobin analysis\n* Ages 18 to 70 years\n* Subjects must have laboratory indices as outlined by the protocol\n* Reliable IV access as determined by a physician\n\nSickle Cell Controls ARM:\n\n* Diagnosis of sickle cell anemia confirmed by hemoglobin analysis\n* Ages 18 to 70 years\n\nSickle Cell CEU ARM:\n\n* Diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, confirmed by hemoglobin analysis\n* Males and females aged 18-70 years\n\nHealthy Control ARM:\n\n* African American\n* Ages 18 to 70 years\n\nTechnique Optimization Control ARM:\n\n* Ages 18 to 70 years\n\nPatient Trial-level Eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

There is no FDA-approved treatment for children with d-IBS. There is evidence that diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome d-IBS may be caused by a mild inflammation in the intestinal lining. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate (SBI) is a medical food, believed to treat mild inflammation in the small intestine associated with some cases of d-IBS, especially those arising after acute gastroenteritis. It improved pain and diarrhea in adults with d-IBS. Our aim is to determine whether SBI improves the number of spontaneous bowel movements in children with d-IBS.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n1.
