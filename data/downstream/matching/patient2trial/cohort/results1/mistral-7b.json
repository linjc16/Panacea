Patients who have undergone an emergency cesarian section will be randomly allocated to either the brief computerized intervention or usual care within the first 6 hours following the operation. Participants will be followed up at one week and one month. It is predicted that participants given the brief computerized intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe clinical symptoms than those who are not. This will inform the potential future development of a simple computerized intervention to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic event such as an emergency cesarean section.\n\nInclusion criteria: Female, aged 18+ years, Had emergency caesarean section within the past 6 hours, Have given birth to a live baby at \u2265 37 weeks gestation.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",

On examination he is in respiratory distress and has bronchial respiratory sounds on the left. A chest x-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates.\n\nTitle: Transmission and the Respiratory Tract in Cryptosporidiosis\n\nSummary:\nCryptosporidium is an intestinal parasite that causes diarrhea in children and adults. In addition to infection of the stomach, this parasite can infect the respiratory system causing a cough and/or problems breathing. This study will enroll 480 children between the ages of 9 and 36 months who come to Mulago Hospital for treatment of diarrhea. Researchers believe a large number of children with diarrhea and cough will have the parasite present in their sputum (mucus coughed up). Researchers also believe that children who have respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis may have a cough, increased number of breaths per minute, and/or a lower oxygen level. Blood, stool, saliva, and sputum samples will be collected from all children in the study and tested for Cryptosporidium. Children too young to provide a sputum sample will have a tube placed to collect a mucus sample from the lungs. Study participation may be as short as 4 hours or as long as 2 days depending on each child's health.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Male and female children aged 9-36 months at the time of enrollment\n2.

Age requirement - The patient is only 21 years old, but the minimum age requirement for the clinical trial is 18 years or older. \n\n2. Immunosuppressive treatment requirement - The patient has a history of alopecia and a rash on the bridge of her nose and cheeks, suggesting possible cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, which is a common complication of SLE, but it does not suggest a requirement for immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the patient may not meet the requirement for immunosuppressive treatment including BENLYSTA. \n\n3. Autoantibody requirement - The patient has a positive ANA and an anti-dsDNA, which are indicative of lupus inflammation, but it is not clear if she is autoantibody-positive. \n\nTaking these factors into account, the assessment of eligibility for the patient in this trial would be: \n\n- Alopecia may indicate that the patient has cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but this can often be treated with corticosteroids which are not considered immunosuppressants. \n- The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia suggest SLE, but a negative anti-dsDNA test result may indicate that the patient does not meet the autoantibody requirement for the clinical trial. \n- The patient's history of protein and RBC casts in her urine suggests active lupus, but this alone may not qualify her for the trial, as she does not currently have active SLE. \n\nBased on this assessment, I would recommend considering this patient further for the clinical trial, and obtaining",
