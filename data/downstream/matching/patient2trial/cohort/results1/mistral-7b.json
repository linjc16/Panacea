Patients who have undergone an emergency cesarian section will be randomly allocated to either the brief computerized intervention or usual care within the first 6 hours following the operation. Participants will be followed up at one week and one month. It is predicted that participants given the brief computerized intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe clinical symptoms than those who are not. This will inform the potential future development of a simple computerized intervention to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic event such as an emergency cesarean section.\n\nInclusion criteria: Female, aged 18+ years, Had emergency caesarean section within the past 6 hours, Have given birth to a live baby at \u2265 37 weeks gestation.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",

On examination he is in respiratory distress and has bronchial respiratory sounds on the left. A chest x-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates.\n\nTitle: Transmission and the Respiratory Tract in Cryptosporidiosis\n\nSummary:\nCryptosporidium is an intestinal parasite that causes diarrhea in children and adults. In addition to infection of the stomach, this parasite can infect the respiratory system causing a cough and/or problems breathing. This study will enroll 480 children between the ages of 9 and 36 months who come to Mulago Hospital for treatment of diarrhea. Researchers believe a large number of children with diarrhea and cough will have the parasite present in their sputum (mucus coughed up). Researchers also believe that children who have respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis may have a cough, increased number of breaths per minute, and/or a lower oxygen level. Blood, stool, saliva, and sputum samples will be collected from all children in the study and tested for Cryptosporidium. Children too young to provide a sputum sample will have a tube placed to collect a mucus sample from the lungs. Study participation may be as short as 4 hours or as long as 2 days depending on each child's health.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Male and female children aged 9-36 months at the time of enrollment\n2.

Age requirement - The patient is only 21 years old, but the minimum age requirement for the clinical trial is 18 years or older. \n\n2. Immunosuppressive treatment requirement - The patient has a history of alopecia and a rash on the bridge of her nose and cheeks, suggesting possible cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, which is a common complication of SLE, but it does not suggest a requirement for immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the patient may not meet the requirement for immunosuppressive treatment including BENLYSTA. \n\n3. Autoantibody requirement - The patient has a positive ANA and an anti-dsDNA, which are indicative of lupus inflammation, but it is not clear if she is autoantibody-positive. \n\nTaking these factors into account, the assessment of eligibility for the patient in this trial would be: \n\n- Alopecia may indicate that the patient has cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but this can often be treated with corticosteroids which are not considered immunosuppressants. \n- The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia suggest SLE, but a negative anti-dsDNA test result may indicate that the patient does not meet the autoantibody requirement for the clinical trial. \n- The patient's history of protein and RBC casts in her urine suggests active lupus, but this alone may not qualify her for the trial, as she does not currently have active SLE. \n\nBased on this assessment, I would recommend considering this patient further for the clinical trial, and obtaining",

Based on the given patient note, the following trial-level eligibility can be determined:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\n\nThe clinical trial in question is a study focused on analyzing the effects of a diabetes-specific enteral formula compared to a standard formula supplemented with protein in critically ill patients in a neurological intensive care unit (ICU). The primary objective of the trial is to determine if the difference in mean blood glucose and glycemic variability between the control and intervention groups for up to 14 days while the patient is in the ICU and receiving tube feeds is significant.\n\nBased on the patient note provided, the patient appears to be a suitable candidate for the study. The patient is an 8-year-old boy who has experienced a head injury resulting in a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and impaired movement in his right upper and lower extremities. This condition is within the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, as patients with critical illness, including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, epidural/subdural bleeds, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are eligible.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's age falls within the acceptable range of 18 to 89 years old. The patient also has a GCS score of 6/15, which indicates that he is critically ill and may require tube feeds to manage his nutritional needs. \n\nHowever, it is essential to note that hyperglycemia is not an inclusion criterion in this trial. While the patient's head injury may cause hyperglycemia, it is not the primary reason for his eligibility in the study.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, the patient is highly likely to be referred to this clinical trial. Referring this patient to the study could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of diabetes-specific enteral formulas versus standard formulas in managing blood glucose levels in critical ill patients, which may contribute to",

Each group of up to 500 subjects consecutively identified from all patients who underwent colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular adenoma (Group 1-2004 to 2006, Group 2 2007-2008).\n\nInclusion Criteria: Any adenoma found on screening/surveillance colonoscopy (ICD9-211.3, Procedure code 45385 or 45380), Greater than 18 years old.\n\n* Assessment of eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

She is otherwise asymptomatic and has a neurologic examination that is unremarkable but a CT scan of the head shows a solitary mass in the right frontal lobe.\n\nThe provided clinical trial aims to evaluate the use of thoracic US in the post-operative setting following thoracic surgery for any indication. However, the patient's lung cancer diagnosis and the need for a chest x-ray and a CT scan indicate that she is not undergoing elective, open, and thoracoscopic thoracic surgery for any indication as per the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial.\n\nTherefore, it is important to further evaluate the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial based on other criteria mentioned in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The other criteria that could be relevant in this case include the location and size of the lung mass, the patient's overall health, and any previous surgeries or treatments.\n\nIf we assume that the location and size of the lung mass are not relevant, and the patient's overall health and previous surgeries/treatments are acceptable, then the patient may be eligible for the clinical trial.

These anomalies are favored by the presence of peripheral neuropathy and plasma levels of advanced glycation end products higher than in diabetic subjects without bone abnormalities. The objectives of this research are to evaluate these anomalies quantitative and qualitative bone in the foot (calcaneus and ankle) through the use of MicroScanner. In parallel a whole body bone mineral density (BMD) and calcaneal ultrasound will be performed to measure bone mineral density as realized in clinical practice in a defined population of patients with type 1 or type 2. These bone abnormalities will be correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy and the rate of advanced glycation end products of proteins and reference to parameters of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to better understand the pathophysiology and target a population at risk. The importance of this study is paramount in the management of diabetic foot. Indeed for the moment we are dealing primarily the consequences of diabetes impact bone when bone deformities have appeared with their attendant disability and the risk of recurrent infections in areas of friction in this fragile environment. The ultimate goal is to target people with diabetes have abnormal bone subclinical and take care to avoid changes to bone deformities and find ways to treat them. \n\nInclusion criteria: \nAdult with type 1 or 2 diabetes with or without neuropath",
