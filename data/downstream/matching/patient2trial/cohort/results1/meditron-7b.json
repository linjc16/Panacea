Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Invasive Haemophilus influenzae Infection in Adults\n\nBackground. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is primarily transmitted via contaminated water and is rarely acquired through person-to-person transmission. During 2016, a large outbreak of cholera was identified in a refugee camp in northern Zambia. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and outcomes of V. cholerae infection in this cohort.Methods. Surveillance of cholera cases was conducted from December 2016 through June 2017. A standard case definition of acute watery or rice-water diarrhea was used for case identification, along with a rectal swab for V. cholerae Ogawa O1 ELISA testing. Clinical and demographic data and information concerning water, sanitation, and crowding were collected in a detailed questionnaire while the patient received inpatient care.Results. Among 787 suspected cholera cases identified, 1028 rectal swabs were collected. The number of cases confirmed by ELISA during the outbreak was 138 (17.7%, 95% CI: 14.9-20.7%), among them 63 (44.9%) were children < 15 years, 42 (30.4%) were infants < 5 years (P < 0.0001), and 68 (49.3%) were male. Cholera patients were more likely to have symptoms of vomiting and dehydration than non-cases (77.6% vs 53.2%, P < 0.0001; 57.2% vs 18.1%, P < 0.0001, respectively).

Two 7-mer peptides A2 and A3 were previously identified through synthesized overlapping peptides that were bound to purified HSP60 by using monoclonal antibody. The third epitope, A1, was deduced through synthesis of truncated peptides that were bound to purified HSP60 and overlapped with two other epitope (A2 and A3). To identify epitopes and compare T cell responses between two C57bl/6 mouse strains, a T cell cloning assay was established. Murine splenocytes from C57bl/6(H-2b) and B10.D2(H-2d) mice primed with HSP60 were stimulated with different overlapping peptides mixed with antigen-presenting cells (APC). After screening cell populations for reactivity to antigens, the most frequent pattern of reactivity was to HSP60 followed by a 7-mer peptide A3. We were able to isolate T cell clones recognizing both A1 and A3 peptides. Surprisingly, we also isolated six T cell clones specific for the HSP60 itself that do not react with any HSP60-derived peptides when tested in a direct T cell proliferation assay. This ability of T cells to recognize the HSP60 and its epitopes correlated with the production of cytokines induced by the HSP60.

This trial is being conducted in a cohort with a similar disease progression so that the clinical effects of the new drug may be assessed in the homogeneous population in an early phase. The new drug is administered to patients as three times at a 28-day interval. The drug is an alkylating agent and it may produce myelosuppression. Myelosuppression is a decrease in numbers of blood cells produced by bone marrow due to the adverse effects of a drug. \n \nThis trial is a phase III trial to test a combined treatment with antidepressants for patients with major depression who failed monotherapy of antidepressant. Treatment-resistant depression, in which patients fail multiple antidepressant treatments, is severe and it affects quality of life and social functioning. This trial is being conducted in a cohort with similar clinical courses and the efficacy of the combined treatment is being assessed by using response rate and remodeling rate of the patients. The combined treatment is administered sixteen times at a 28-day interval on average. Combined treatment consists of an antidepressant and an anxiolytic.\n \nThis is a phase IV trial comparing two antihistamines for patients with allergic rhinitis. The clinical effects between two antihistamines are being assessed by determining difference in score of nasal patency and nasal symptoms. This trial is being conducted once at the last date of allergy season. Antihistamines work by inhibiting H1 receptors and blocking the production of chemical mediators of the inflammation response, such as serotonin, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.

However, a role for the BAinduced altered flux of cellular energy metabolism in affecting cellular dysfunction is unknown. Using metabolomics, it has been reported that cytosolic pyruvate is consumed in mouse cholangiocytes via a maladaptive mode of energy metabolism to supply cytosolic acetyl-CoA for BA synthesis. However, whether the reduced pyruvate availability affects energy metabolism and/or hepatic functions is unclear. A reduction in the flux of one or more glycolytic intermediates, such as pyruvate, is expected to increase pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and result in cytosolic alanine production. Here we report that the levels of the BA hydroxylation products, CA/MCA/HCA are increased in the livers and bile of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and these correlate with increased levels of alanine in the bile of these patients. To mimic these observations in experimental models, in vivo bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice upregulated PDH and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) expression and inhibited the PDHE1 phosphorylation in the livers. Using an ex vivo liver perfusion system, we found that a shortterm perfusion of BDL livers with deoxyglucose (DAGA) reduced the accumulation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and attenuated the inhibition of PDHE1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, perfusion with BAM15, a metabolic probe known to increase acetyl-CoA utilization during ketogenesis, similarly decreased the inhibition of PDHE1 phosphorylation, cytosol",

However, serum PSA level is used as a prognostic biomarker in nonurologic conditions including cardiovascular system, kidney, liver, and respiratory diseases. Method: In this study, we investigated the serum PSA level in patients with painful diabetic retinopathy (DR) (nodal painful DR with and without retinal detachment) and compared with that of patients with nonpainful DR. Results: Our present findings showed increased serum PSA in patients with painful DR (60.09 \u00b1 2.8 ng/mL) compared to the serum PSA levels of the patients with nonpainful DR (45.55 \u00b1 3.7 ng/mL). There was a statistically significant difference in the serum PSA level between these two groups (p < 0.01). Similarly, we find increased serum PSA in the patients with nodal painful DR (1.06 \u00b1 0.05 ng/mL) compared to the patients with nonpainful DR (0.66 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL) (p < 0.01).

LncRNA XIST expression in gastric cancer tissues and the paired adjacent normal tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the relationship between XIST and miR-99a. Moreover, we performed transwell assay in SGC7901 to detect whether XIST could influence cell invasion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nXIST expression levels of gastric cancer tissues were higher than that of paired non-tumor tissue. XIST expression levels were higher in gastric cancer patients with lymph node metastases than those without lymph node metastases. Moreover, XIST expression levels were also high in gastric cancer patients with lymphovascular invasion. Finally, in gastric cancer patients, higher XIST expression levels had poor prognosis. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that XIST may regulate miR-99a. In addition, we found that knockdown of XIST decreases SGC7901 cell invasion, an effect that could be reversed by knockdown of miR-99a.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLncRNA XIST was highly expressed in gastric cancer. Furthermore, high XIST expression is associated with lymph node metastases and lymphovascular invasion. Besides, in gastric cancer, XIST could promote SGC7901 cell line invasion by targeting miR-99a in vitro.<EOD> Comparison of the HAQ questionnaire to objective tests of physical function: an analysis strategy\n\nIntroduction: The 20-item Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is in almost daily use as a measure of physical function",

Amygdala neurons are known to express both NMDA\u2010 and mGluR5\u2010mediated forms of long\u2010term depression (LTD), but the interaction between NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and mGluR5s is poorly understood. We report that NMDA\u2010mediated synaptic depression in the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) exhibits a biphasic time\u2010course and can be blocked by mGluR5 antagonists and a L\u2010type calcium channel blocker. NMDA\u2010mediated short\u2010term depression involves endocytosis of AMPA receptors and requires PKC activity. In contrast, NMDAR\u2010dependent LTD requires activation of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling and involves endocytosis of presynaptic components, the dephosphorylation of GluR1/AMPA receptors, and a reduction in the size of release sites. These novel findings suggest a mechanistic relationship between NMDA\u2010mediated short\u2010term depression and long\u2010term depression that depends on activation of mGluR5s and L\u2010type calcium channels. These data suggest models of bidirectional regulation of basolateral amygdala plasticity that are related to synaptic scaling mechanisms, and may be relevant to the mechanism of fear conditioning.<EOD> A comparative study of the effects of nifedipine and 5-(N,N-diethylamino)nicotinamide-4'-sulfonamide on platelet aggregation and experimental thrombosis.\nOral administration of one of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, nifedipine, exerts inhibitory effects on both in vitro platelet aggregation and experimental thrombosis.

Two in-line diffusers were placed side by side in the centre of the room along with an air quality monitor. Samples were collected at regular time intervals over a three-day period. The results found that over the course of a three-day period, a 13-inch in-line diffuser was able to remove 86% of the particulate matter within 4 m of the diffuser, whereas the 1-inch in-line diffuser removed 60% from a distance of 3 m. The results concluded that an in-line diffuser was able to remove particulates much further into a room than current recommendations suggest.\n\n# Introduction\nIndoor air quality has a significant impact on human health and psychological development, and often times it needs to be improved as the health implications of unclean indoor air may have a greater impact on a particular population. The implications of the quality of indoor air on human health have been documented in many scientific studies showing that indoor air can, in some cases, be worse than outdoor air as it is subjected to various types of emissions and pollutions. A study was conducted in a California office building to assess how the indoor air quality compared to the outdoor air quality, and the study concluded that the indoor air quality of the office building was significantly worse than that of the outdoor air, with many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside being much higher than those of the outdoor air.\nResearch has shown that even when the outside air is clean, indoor air may include several airborne particulates and pollutants, which may have serious impacts on the",

Allergic asthma represents a significant and increasing health problem that affects 1-20% of the population, with children being the most affected. Allergic asthma is caused by airway inflammation mediated by allergens and pollutants and is associated with respiratory symptoms that progress to irreversible airflow obstruction with disease severity. Currently, immunotherapy is the only treatment capable of modifying the disease course; however, this therapeutic intervention does not induce or maintain a long-term protection against the immune response to inhalant allergens in all patients, which is an important disadvantage. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new vaccine (Sci/Glob) in a cohort of Mexican patients allergic to D. pteronyssinus. Methodology. The current study took place between July and November 2020, at the Allergy Clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Security, Toluca, Mexico. A total of 23 patients were enrolled in the study, all of whom suffered from mild and persistent asthma due to D. pteronyssinus from previous allergy tests (SPT/prick) and had a serum specific IgE (sIgE) level >0.7 KU/L using commercial tests. All patients started the treatment with the standard protocol (1 dose/week). During the treatment, there was a 40% decrease (p\u22640.001) in the number of sneezes, accompanied by the reduction of the sIgE levels over time. The treatment was well tolerated by all volunteers. No changes in lung function or in the clinical presentation of the disease were observed.",

You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to provide reliable and comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects from the patient's perspective. The adverse effect has a three-point scale: 0) No adverse effect observed; 1) Mild adverse effects that would resolve quickly with intervention; and 2) Severe adverse effects that would resolve quickly with continued intervention. You should make a trial-level assessment of adverse effects for each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of adverse effects.\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life.

Higher metastasis rate and poor prognosis were often observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact for immune cell markers in metastasis rate and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.Materials and methods: In this study, we first identified a cluster of four immune-related genes through univariate Cox regression analysis and established a risk model by combining those four genes. Then, we determined the prognosis value of our risk model in lung adenocarcinoma. To explore the correlation between our risk model and patients' clinical features, clinical correlation analysis were conducted in lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we analyzed the potential molecular signaling pathways underlying the prognostic value of four immune related genes (PD1, IL2, IRF3 and TNFSF10).Results: In total, 532 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 366) and a validation",

As part of this review data are analysed using factor scores derived from the EPI and two measures of Masculine-Feminine Orientation in addition to the two original personality scales. It is suggested that Eysenck's theory is invalidated by recent studies which show no cross-sex differences on measures of Psychoticism or the newly derived scale of Pure-Psychoticism. The theory is supported by the findings that there are very few cross-sex differences on the original Extraversion-Introversion scale and on the new factor of Social Aversiveness.

Our patient, however, complained of hearing loss after the use of hydrogen peroxide-soaked gauze for ETT suctioning. She reported that she had the same symptoms after the use of gauze soaked with other disinfectants, including chlorhexidine gluconate, povidone-iodine, and sodium hypochlorite. Furthermore, she had a complaint of tinnitus, which was resolved when she was discharged from the study ICU. Thus, the mechanism may be related to a hydroperoxidation reaction or a peroxidation of membrane proteins by hydrogen peroxide. Although it has not been reported in the literature, hydrogen peroxide is known to have damaging effects on the inner ear, particularly when an excessive amount is administered.

However, the utility of this treatment is unclear in high-risk IPMN.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in patients who underwent endoscopic pancreatic resection for IPMN from April 2016 to October 2019. S-IPMN was considered the high-risk group, and E-IPMN was considered the low-risk group.Results: Ninety-seven patients were included. The proportion of men was higher in the S-IPMN group than in the E-IPMN group with a significant difference. In all patients, 161 pancreatic juice samples (64 samples in the E-IPMN group and 97 samples in the S-IPMN group) were extracted for cytology, including brushing cytology and cell block/liquid-based cytology. The positivity rates of both cytologies were higher in the S-IPMN group than in the E-IPMN group (61/97 [pap] and 60/64 [smear], respectively), with significant differences. For high-risk IPMN, a total of 121 pancreatic juice samples were extracted. Among them, the rate of positive cytology in the S-IPMN group was 26/36 (72.2%), and that in the E-IPMN group was 5/26 (19.2%), with a significant difference.

However, the mechanisms underlying vascular MMP activation are not well defined. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2010mediated activation of MMP\u20108 and a specific MMP\u20102 activator, MMP\u201014, participate in vascular smooth muscle cell migration. Methods and results: We transfected the MMP\u201014 gene into a vascular smooth muscle cell\u2010rich human umbilical vein (HUV) endothelial cell line and then injured the transfected HUVECs with PDGF for a 2\u2010hour incubation. Compared with cells without MMP\u201014 transfection, gelatin zymography showed that MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20108 activities were significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased in MMP\u201014\u2010transfected HUVECs. Next, we treated intact HUVECs with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the superoxide anion\u2010generating compound 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis(2\u2010aminopropane) dihydrochloride, or the hydroxyl radical\u2010generating compound FeCl2/ascorbate for 2 hours. All these treatments induced MMP\u20102 activation and significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased the MMP\u20108 activity, suggesting that ROS\u2010mediated mechanisms are involved in the activation of MMP\u20108. Additionally, ROS\u2010mediated MMP\u20108 activation in intact HUVECs led to a significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased cell number migrating into the culture\u2010insert\u2010coated membranes. However, an MMP\u20108\u2010antagonizing peptide significantly (P <\u200a0.05) decreased cell migration into the culture\u2010insert\u2010coated membranes. Finally",

Background:Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and are diagnosed histologically and clinically. The Crohn\u2019s and colitis diseases are often associated with long-term adverse outcomes and are typically treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and surgery, which comes with the added effect of psychological distress. Therefore, there is an increased interest in identifying prognostic indicators in both pediatric- and adult-onset IBDs to guide personalized therapy and monitoring. Methods:We conducted a search of the MEDLINE databases to retrieve the articles published from January 1998 to June 2010 with the keywords: (1) \u201cinflammatory bowel diseases\u201d OR \u201cinflammatory bowel \u201c AND (2) \u201cbiological markers\u201d OR \u201cbiochemical markers\u201c OR \u201cdiagnostic markers\u201d OR (3) \u201cCrohn\u2019s disease\u201d OR \u201ccolitis\u201d OR (4) \u201cbiochemical parameters.\u201d We included papers published in English that investigated specific diagnostic markers of IBDs.

        "output": "Q. How do you find a group to test your system?\n\n\nA. To test your data, you could create data from previous patients or synthesize it from a variety of source in order to form an artificial population. There are a few methods that you can use to simulate such a population and generate the synthetic data required for a clinical trial:\n   1.  Random sample: In many cases, for clinical trials which are designed to be large and generalizable in terms of target population, it might be sufficient to randomly sampling from the data from the database to create a trial sample population. \n   2.  Generate synthetic data from a pre-existing, representative data set\n   3.  Generate synthetic data from a normal distribution\n   4.  Generate synthetic data from machine learning or natural language processing model results\n\n    \nAs you can see, there are many options to test your system. Generally, the first choice is random samples.\n\n---\n\nQ. How do we make the report?\n\n\nA. To write the report, you could use the command [Report](index.md#mdp_report) to run the templates, or manually create a report yourself. The template is written in YAML, which is a light-weight, human-readable data description language.\nThere are two ways to generate a report.\n\nYou could use yml2report to convert data to a yaml report. A YAML report can then be given to an editor or rendered as webpage as desired.\nPlease review [Report generation using yml2report](index.md#mdr_reportgeneration-using-command-yml2report)\n\nAlternatively, you could use template directly. You can use the command [Report Generation With Template (reportmd)](index.md#reportmd_reportgeneration-using-templates) to generate reports with data and templates.\n \n\n---\n\nQ. What tools to we need to train and evaluate the model?\n\nA.\n\nTo train and evaluate the model, we can use any machine learning learning framework and tools with tensorflow, keras, sklearns, etc.\nYou also need to use a library to visualize the results of a model. One of the most popular visualization libraries is seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas.  Please review [Visualization](",

There is currently an emerging understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human immune responses. It was reported that infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in rapid activation of proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, expansion of both innate (including NK-cells) and adaptive immune cells (including memory B-cells and antibody-producing plasmablasts), and induction of specific antibody titers. In this study, a longitudinal immunological study was conducted in 58 patients to evaluate the immunological responses during the early-stage and the late-stage of severe COVID-19. The number of lymphocyte subsets significantly decreased between hospital admission (17.6-25.2 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL) and 28 days later in the early stages of COVID-19 patients (16.1-17.0 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL). Thereafter, the lymphocyte number recovered to around 14.5-16.1 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL in the late stages of the COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses and neutralizing antibody were detected in most patients, and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM responses were low in comparison. Based on our results, it is important to prepare for the surge of COVID-19 cases in the future.\n\n# Introduction\nAt the end of 2019, a new viral infectious disease was discovered in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, causing serious pneumonia.

Chemotherapy was administered every three weeks. Thirty patients received the whole treatment, 10 received only the combination of 5-FU and folinic (10/10) or 5-FU (5/5). Forty-two percent objective responses were obtained. The response rate was 47% for gastric tumours and 63% for distant metastatic disease. The most common toxicities were vomiting, alopecia and leukopenia. The authors conclude that the combination of 5-FU with folinic acid is very effective in the treatment of locally advanced inoperative gastric carcinoma and has also significant activity against distant metastatic disease. This protocol is also well tolerated and can be used safely in an outpatients clinic setting, although 32% of the patients required supportive measures to prevent leukopenia. The authors suggest the administration of cisplatin in 3 divided doses with a minimum interval of 6 hours and at least 7 days apart.<EOD> Antimicrobial susceptibility against Staphylococcus spp. from patients at a Tanzanian children's hospital\n\nObjective: To determine the prevalence and susceptibility to selected antimicrobials of Staphylococcus spp. from patients at a Tanzanian children's hospital.

We observed that during the first several days after surgery the rats exhibited transient hyperlipidemia. However, during the last 7 to 10 days before mortality, the blood lipid levels gradually decreased and all rats showed low serum cholesterol levels just prior to death. Moreover, during the last 1 to 2 days before mortality, the serum free fatty acids level began to decrease as well. All of the above suggest that the abdominal adherence of poly(vinyl) alcohol adhesive used to occlude the common bile duct in Sprague-Dawley rats is not a factor in serum lipid alterations, or in the development or severity of hepatomegaly induced in these rats by poly(vinyl alcohol) adhesive.<EOD> The role of endogenous and exogenous substance p on gastric emptying and acid secretion.\nThe role of histamine-containing neurons in gastric mot",

Twenty-four radiographs of primary molars, obtained from digital storage phosphor plates, were digitalized. Three dentists with different academic and clinical backgrounds were selected to determine the level of agreement between themselves. To evaluate the level of agreement between the observers and expert radiologist, 145 radiographs were assessed by the dentists. After the assessments were completed, a sample of 37 randomly selected digital images were reviewed by each dentist and periapical radiologist. The inter- and intra-rater levels were calculated by means of Kappa statistics. The data were tabulated in order to evaluate the frequency values. The agreement levels for pulpal and apical pathologies between the dentists were evaluated as follows: excellent between dentists 1 and 2; very good between dentists 1 or 2 and expert radiologist; and good for dentists 3 and 4. When all of the assessments were analyzed together, the inter-rater agreement levels were moderate to good, in descending order, for dentists 3 and 4. The intra-rater agreement levels were very good to excellent for all of the observers. In conclusion, the intra-rater diagnoses were better than the inter-rater diagnoses and when the experts were compared to the dentists, a higher inter-rater agreement level was observed for the pulpal diagnosis.

Let us begin with food which has not been digested, and which cannot pass safely. Then we have meat, especially pork, and especially the flesh of sick animals; and we have the foods that cause gout, and the foods of the lower animals which are not human food; and we have food which has not been well prepared or stored; while perhaps the greatest source of indigestible matter is the drink which is the favourite beverage, and in which people are so careless of hygiene and cleanliness. These I hold to be the real causes of what they term \" bilious diarrhoea,\" and I believe, if it were possible, that the greatest number of cases of diarrhoea would be cut short were the drink and the food taken only under strict hygienic conditions.\nBut there are other things besides drink and food which may be the occasional cause of diarrhoea.\nWe find sometimes what has been called \"water-brash,\" which consists of half-digested food washing round the stomach, and then running down the intestine, which can be easily diagnosed by looking at the stools. Then we find many patients who have some sort of acute disease will have diarrhoea with their acute malady, and this usually ceases as soon as the acute symptoms cease. Then we have the \"intestinal fevers,\" such as typhoid, cholera, and so on, with the constant stool; but as this is beyond discussion I will not say anything of it further.\nThen we have the bacteria in the intestines, and we have the parasitic diseases, the worms and the round worms and the thread worms, which are not yet known to produce diarrhoea, but which may do and which give rise to it in conjunction with the other causes",

This cytokine exerts its principal activity during the early stages of leukocyte recruitment, being involved in angiogenesis and cell proliferation and migration or in inflammatory cell activation and differentiation. In these processes IL\u20108 regulates the expression of other cytokines (such as GM\u2010CSF and TGF\u2010\u03b2), chemotaxis, infiltration of the tumor masses by leukocytes, and tumor growth. Concentrations of IL\u20108 in ascitic fluid, in pleural effusions, and in plasma are elevated in patients with ovarian carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, and high concentrations of this cytokine also occur in the peritoneal fluid and in plasma of endometrium affected patients. In human tumors, the neoplastic cells may themselves secrete IL\u20108.

This may lead to an increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP, surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of the aqueous outflow.

A total of 403 Chinese adults completed questionnaires comprised primarily of the Weight Concerns Measure-Chinese version, the Weight Bias Internalization Scale, the Weight Loss Intention Scale, the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, and selected items from the Exercise Recovery and Motivation Examination.

The molecular adsorption processes of the cation and anion separately on an ideal hydrophilic surfaces as well as the mixed adsorption on hydrophilic silica surface are explored at first. A similar mechanism is adopted for the adsorption of the cation and anion separately on hydrophobic PS surfaces. Furthermore, the adsorption and mixing between hydrophilic silica surface and hydrophobic PS surfaces are also investigated. According to the mean force analysis, there are two adsorption states for cations and anions including the partially adsorbed state and the deeply adsorbed state with both cation and anion involved. The deeply adsorbed state with cation and anion simultaneously adsorbed on hydrophilic silica surfaces is the minimum energy state with a larger ads",

A total study group of 4769 patients were categorized into two age groups: under 10 years of age group (UYG) and 10 years and older (OYG). While UYG decreased from 43% of the total study group in 1990 to 6.9% in 2010, OYG increased from 57% to 93.1% during the same period. The leading etiology in all groups in 1990 was thermal (32%); it reduced to 26% (UYG) and 23.5% (OYG) in 2010. Flame burns showed 36% reduction from 20% in 1990 to 13% in 2010. Electrical burns increased from 18.5% in 1990 to 39.6% in 2010. Burn etiologies increased and were highest for house-hold chemicals and kitchen burns in India. Changing demographics in burn patients of Mumbai over a 20 year period were attributed to changes in the etiology of burns based on the cultural, social, economic factors and the improvement in socioeconomic status on the part of the patients. More females were treated over the duration of the study period. This may be related to the increasing social status of Indian women who are now seen as bread earners. Young children under 10 years also showed a decreasing trend and elderly patients showed increasing trend in number treated from 1990 to 2010.

The moment sequence is derived from the proposed distribution, a generalisation of the Gauss distribution, based on the proposed multivariate density function and the moment generating function. This sequence contains the mean and four moments of the remote sensing image in the same form as other classical moment models, which facilitates image degradation analysis. It is shown that the proposed sequence is capable of obtaining higher estimation accuracy than previously derived moment estimators, which could be used to obtain better estimation of the image degradation in terms of the geometric accuracy and texture details. The simulation and image interpretation tests are conducted to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. Sensors 2016, 16, 34 2 of 16image degradation, particularly in terms of the geometric properties. However, the classical moment models fail to directly assess the geometric and optical characteristics of remote sensing images.To address the above problem, a set of improved moments were proposed by Huang[23], Jiang [24], and Wu [25,26]to estimate the degree of geometric distortion in aerial orthophoto images. These moments are derived from the proposed multivariate distribution, with a closed-form calculation of parameters achieved by fitting an image data set. The theoretical model is very easy to implement, and can be applied to all types of remote sensing image; however, this type of model only reflects the overall trend of geometric distortion in remote sensing images, and is not easy to quantitatively describe image texture. Some new moments were proposed by Zhu[27]in order to estimate both geometric and textural characteristics in an image. To obtain an effective set of moments for image degradation assessment, Zhu utilized the theory of the moment of image degradation proposed by Jalali [28], which described the spatial structure and texture of the image. Zhu compared the modified moment sequence with the classical moment sequence in order to better estimate the degree of geometric degradation in images and further evaluate the image quality. Compared with the classical moments, the modified sequence of moments could better describe the geometric and text",

However, the relationships between the plateletto-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival of patients undergoing surgery for upper tract UC (UTUC) remains unknown. This study investigated the prognostic significance of PLR in these patients. Patients and methods: We included 123 consecutive patients with UTUC who underwent surgery after diagnosis at Fremantle Hospital and Health Service between October 2002 and November 2015. Clinicopathological characteristics of patients were reviewed. The association of preoperative PLR with other clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes was assessed. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate 5-year cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS), which were compared by using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify factors affecting the CSS and OS. Results: The cohort of 14 men and 103 women had a median age of 70 (interquartile range [IQR], 66-74). The median preoperative PLR in all patients was 186.4 (IQR, 135.7-256.2). Preoperative PLR was not associated with the disease and clinicopathological characteristics of UTUC patients except in patients with grade 3 renal function (p = 0.04). Multivariate analyses indicated preoperative PLR was an independent factor in the prediction of both CSS (p = 0.03) and OS (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The results from our study indicated an association between the higher preoperative PLR with worse outcomes in patients with UTUC. PLR was suggested to be a better predictor to evaluate the postoperative survival.\n\n# Introduction\nUpper tract uro",

All patients had elevated hepatic transaminase levels and had a histological score greater than 9 points on scale from 0 to 18. They were treated with a combination of alpha interferon and recombinant leukocyte alpha interferon. The trial aim was to evaluate safety and tolerability, and also to evaluate the dose escalation schedule. Efficacy end points were complete and partial relapse-free response, and progression of disease. The drug combination did not increase the toxicity observed with alpha interferon alone, and no deaths resulted from treatment. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled. The drug administration schedule consisted of four consecutive treatment cycles of 10 days each every 8 weeks. The alpha interferon dose was 6 MU initially, and the leukocyte alpha interferon dose was 1 MU. Dose escalation was at week 4, to 12 MU for alpha interferon and 2 MU for leukocyte alpha interferon. The mean maximal hepatic transaminase levels after treatment were normalized in half of the treated patients. Two patients achieved sustained full remission. Ten patients (34%) showed a sustained amelioration of liver disease and normalization of hepatic transaminase levels for a period of at least 3 months or longer after the last treatment. All patients had a favourable tolerance to treatment as assessed by both clinical and laboratory evaluation. The Phase I study design was adapted to the specific properties of antihepatitis C virus drugs with the aim of identifying the minimum dosage and schedule in phase II studies with an objective of minimizing toxicity while maintaining efficacy end points of the study. The authors found that the dosage schedule used in this Phase I study does not produce greater toxicity than the reference treatment with alpha interferon alone and may be applied in future phase II studies to treat hepatitis C disease.<EOD> A Flexible Biodegradable Hydrogel Dressing for Sealing Wounds\n\n [bib_ref]  Chitosan hydrogel/",

As the SCD population is one of the most commonly prescribed acetaminophen (APAP) in children, it is imperative for providers to closely follow these patients to ensure they are not experiencing liver disorders that result in a severe hepatitis from APAP. Two pediatric patients, ages 1.4 and 10.4, were seen in consultations for an emergent workup of liver disorders after APAP was discovered in their urine and blood. While both patients did not have documented liver disease or history of liver damage, APAP poisoning was not ruled out. The first patient's blood test was not indicative of APAP poisoning and was discharged, while the second patient underwent a 72-hour urine collection for APAP. Both patients were instructed to stop using the Tylenol (APAP) for 24 hours, and the result of their 72 urine collection ruled out APAP poisoning. While liver tests in healthy children are often normal, some literature has revealed that 10% of children given APAP for a few days had acute liver damage, so it is important to observe the proper amount of APAP that pediatric patients with SCD or SCT that are taking APAP are receiving and closely watch the liver function test results in these patients.Abstract:Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or sickle cell trait (SCT) have a unique disease prognosis that consists of a multitude of complications ranging from delayed bone age, avascular necrosis (AVN",

Methods: This was a retrospective study comparing findings in 40 consecutive non-pregnant women to those in 40 pregnant women and those in 35 early preterm labor patients. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed and T1-weighted images (T1WI), T2-weighted images (T2WI), fat-suppressed T2WI (FST2WI), and gadoliniumenhanced fat-suppressed T1WI (EFIGS) were analyzed and compared. Measurements on the T1WI were used to obtain canal diameter and canal length, and measurements on the PETRA image were used to measure fatty infiltration. We evaluated the distance between the posterior ligaments, lateral vertebral body, and posterior ligament to the cervical canal, which was termed the posterior height and posterior ligament, which was termed the Torg ratio. The PETRA images were used to evaluate disk height. Results: Canal diameter, canal length, and the difference in the diameter of the cervical canal were significantly greater in the pregnant group. PETRA measurements showed significantly greater canal diameter, posterior height, intracanal fat space, lateral vertebral body height, disk height, and disk height at the L4/5 and L5/S1 levels in the pregnant group.

Blood specimens were also drawn after fasting. The checklist was made up of four parts on sociodemographic data and personal history, obstetric history, obstetric examination, and clinical evaluation.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nAn evaluation of the nutritional state was done with three complemental tests: weight, height and thickness.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA previous history of perinatal disease is the major risk factor (p < 0.0001) for perinatal morbidity. Other risk factors shown are: being an adolescent or a woman aged 35 or above, living in a low socioeconomic level, not being a housewife, unscheduled delivery, non-use of antenatal care, pregnancy of more than 37 weeks, presence of urinary tract infection, fever, anemia, and a history of hypertension. When the nutritional state of the women is analyzed it is confirmed the relationship between poor nutritional state and perinatal morbidity. The relationship between parity and perinatal morbidity tends to be shown in women aged 35 and over. The presence of anemia is linked to prem",

If you have this question and this type of patient, you should think these patient note contents in the following way. For instance, you can think as follows: \n- This patient's age is 66. The inclusion criteria of the clinical trial require the inclusion within 6 months of age, but not within 6 months and 6 month of age. Thus, this patient's age is not consistent with the clinical trial's inclusion criteria. Therefore, this patient may not be referred to this clinical trial. Note that whether you agree with the assessment of eligibility in this trial is your decision. \n- This patient has been diagnosed with cardiac artery thrombosis. The inclusion criteria of the clinical trial require patients (including children and infants) with a thrombosis, but this one does not specify which area of the body thrombosis is. Thus, this patient's thrombosis area is not consistent with the inclusion criteria of the trial. Moreover, in another clinical trial, it is required that one is diagnosed with a systemic thrombus. The patient's thrombus is limited to the femoral artery, so the patient is highly likely to be referred to that trial.\n\nAfter you have checked this problem in the `Note`, let\\s think other questions.

For instance, you can think so: \n - This patient's diagnosis is cardiac artery thrombosis, not systemic thrombosis. Therefore, it's highly likely to be referred to this trial. \n - A bruit indicates an arterial thrombosis. This patient's thrombosis is arterial, so it's highly likely to be referred to this trial.\n - If doctors know the reason for the thrombosis, they will find out whether the therapy has a thrombosis area.

Some patients had a history of smoking. The clinical symptoms were non-specific and lack of typical manifestation. The physical examination and laboratory examination were normal. B-ultrasonography and chest X-ray were not so useful in the diagnosis of this disease. Bronchoscopy observation did not appear any specific pathological characteristics. Pathological diagnosis was required after obtaining biopsies for histology examination and immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis of LELC should be according to at least the following the conditions: (1) the tumor cells showed a nest-like architectural arrangement; (2) the tumor cells were closely arranged and showed lymphocytic infiltration. And immunohistochemistry had to showed cytoplasmic CD56 expression, and negative of CD20 and CD3 in the tumor cells. (3) no in situ lesions and other primary tumor were found. There were some differences in clinical manifestation and pathological features, even with same immunophenotype, between epithelial cell LELC and nasopharyngeal LELC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was no effective treatment for LELC based on the experience from current cases.

To assess the inactive enzyme, two different approaches are possible: we can compare the enzymatic activity of a preparation of enzyme with or without activator present; or we can use competitive inhibitors of the activated enzyme to estimate the fraction of total enzyme lacking activator. We chose the latter technique because of the extreme sensitivity of the activated enzyme to hydrolytic inactivation. The method used by Dr Chao and Dr Cocchiso was only one of many possible inhibitor analogs. The inactivation of plasminogen activator by soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 units/ml), e-aminocaproic acid (100mg/ml), p-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone (300,ug/ml),and p-aminobenzoyl arginine (100mg/ml) were not significantly inhibited by the addition of activator or antibody for either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator. We were also interested in trying to inhibit the plasminogen activators by using the plasminogen activator inhibitors isolated from human serum (3, 4). Again, however, there was no effect on tissue or urinary activator with the purified plasminogen activator inhibitor proteins studied. The results of Dr Chao and Dr Cocchiso are certainly interesting. The methods used were novel and could well have been effective in demonstrating differences in the ability of these two activators to bind to activator antibodies, had we been able to supply them with the purified antibodies in sufficient amounts. Unfortunately, we have been unable to raise antibodies to the purified activators and therefore it was impossible to carry out the additional experiments suggested.<EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nA large international study showed a relationship between the use of antidepressants and the onset of hyponatraemia which was not explained by concomitant diseases,",

They are involved in processes ranging from the initiation of development to response to stress and inhibition of pathogens. Thus, phytohormones represent important targets for agriculture in the context of crop yield and nutritive value and also to tackle threats to human health, such as the increasing amount of toxic agents via the food chain. Here, we describe genetic and physiological analyses of a new brassinosteroid-insensitive mutant, tbr. The tbr plant displays increased tolerance toward brassinosteroids, a steroid group of hormones essential for many processes in plant development and growth. Analysis of brassinosteroid metabolism in tbr plants revealed normal levels of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, transport, and accumulation. Instead, tbr plants are characterized by a hyper-sensitive phenotype toward elevated levels of brassinosteroids (at doses inducing wild-type plant growth promotion), manifested most prominently in plant stem growth, root branching, and trichome formation (i.e. the density of glandular structures). These phenotypes are independent of the developmental stage of each tested tissue, thus reflecting a rather general increase in brassinosteroid response. The tbr seedlings are also hypersensitive toward ethylene-inhib",

Bacteria with pathogen suppressive activities towards R. solani have been reported; however, only a few such studies have been conducted in the Indian context. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge regarding identification of rhizoctonia antagonistic bacteria, strain development, in vitro and in vivo pathogen inhibitory tests and various applications of bacterial antagonists in plant production systems. The review shows that phytopathogenic R. solani has a wide range of hosts; however, only a few reports are available regarding the in vitro antagonistic ability of soil bacteria against this common soil-borne fungus. Bacterial strains from a wide range of genera, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Serratiobacter, are capable of inhibiting Rhizoctonia spp. in vitro and when used in growing media in association with seeds or plant parts. A limited number of field studies from different parts of the globe also indicate that the application of antagonists alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers leads to increased yields of host crops. Hence, the use of antagonistic bacteria seems to be a promising tool in controlling soil-borne pathogens in the field conditions, but to be feasible, more intensive research programmes are needed in regard to various steps of the process.<EOD> Role of microRNA-29b-3p in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperuricemia\n\nBackground:",

All three of these channels experience different degrees of competition from each other. The Canadian pharmacy distribution channels have been developed as they are today in part as a consequence of legislated and natural monopolies, localized regulation and licensing of entities, and historical practices. The structure of these distribution chains results in a variety of market failures. Consequently, the pharmacy distribution channel in Canada can evolve substantially to the betterment of the health of Canadians. Improvements are possible, and must be made, since drug product (medicines) and the drug distribution process are fundamental determinants of therapeutic and economic outcomes for all patients. We conclude that the Canadian pharmacy distribution channels must evolve and propose that the evolution of this channel should be based on the principles of efficiency, economic considerations, and equity, with a focus on maximizing overall societal value. This will require substantial changes in the structure of the three distribution channels and the reengineering of the pharmaceutical industry's business model. Some of these changes are possible now, and several are possible in the foreseeable future, through legislative intervention and the removal of impediments to market forces. The future distribution structure will also depend on changes in the way drugs are priced and paid for, including changes in the regulation of pharmacy-reimbursable generic products. We recommend that the future structure of the Canadian pharmacy distribution channel should be based on the following principles: 1) maximize therapeutic and economic outcomes (i.e., maximizing the amount of",

This condition is often diagnosed during pregnancy. Infants with Down's syndrome have a distinctive pattern of physical traits. These traits often include unusually small fingers, a bulbous appearance to the stomach region, a flattened face, and a short neck. The severity of the signs and symptoms related to Down's syndrome varies from child to child. People with mild to moderate Down's syndrome often have some of the physical challenges, but to a lesser degree than those who have severe Down's syndrome. Children with Down's syndrome develop a series of physical, motor, cognitive, and behavioral challenges that may be life-threatening.  **2018**\n* Huntington disease, also known as Huntington's chorea, is a rare hereditary autosomal-dominant neuropsychiatric disorder caused by a cytosine-adenineadenine (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4. Huntington disease commonly manifests in adults, often during their prime. The disorder is characterized by motor dysfunction - particularly chorea - psychological symptoms, and cognitive decline. This disease is incurable. Huntington's gene can also lead to a more severe juvenile form with much earlier onset of symptomatology, the prognosis of which is also grimmer.

This is a nice program that makes some good advances in automated clinical note processing, however, still leaves some shortcomings that need to be addressed:\nFirst, I will re-express my concern about the difficulty in making the correct determination of sentence boundaries. This appears to be a more difficult than some of the other tasks. I know that you believe that the problems are because of the very short sentences or the very short notes. While that may be partially the truth, I do not think that it is all of the difficulty. I believe that there is enough material with complex syntax to make it very hard to determine the right sentence boundary. In my own work for the CQI task, I found that it is more possible to determine if a particular word or phrase in a sentence is either a noun or a verb with a simple list of terms than to be able to determine sentence boundary.\nIn addition, there is a lot of negativity in the output of the system that makes an unskilled user suspect that there are actual problems with the program. For example, in the example: \"A physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right femoral artery \" what is meant by \", \"? The first term \"A physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman \" is a negative-only phrase that indicates that the patient is not a physician or a 67-year-old woman, etc. The \"who underwent cardiac catheterization\" is also problematic, because of its negativism, but since the previous term is a list of negatives, it is clear that it is an inappropriate term, but it would not be my first choice to put there. But I really get it upset when I see the negativism of the phrase \"via the right femoral artery \" , because not only is this correct wording as it is spelled above, but it is also a correct statement that the catheterization was performed through the femoral artery in the right leg. In addition, it is clear that this is not a problem that the physician or the patient had.\nThe second area of concern was with the lack",

        "output": "## Explanation\nTo train this task, we want you to build two models. One for the task of patient-level eligibility assessment. The target for the model is 31 labels which were used in the dataset. The second model is for the trial-level eligibility assessment, where the target number of labels depends on the trials, but it's approximately 60 labels.\n- **Patient-level task**\n- The task is to assess patient-level eligibility. The model will be trained to give a probabilistic estimate of eligibility for the patient. It depends on various aspects, for example: how the patient's condition changes over time, so it is better to train a system which takes past information into consideration. The system may also take into account comorbidities, which could be important for explaining why the patient is not eligible/eligible to participate in a clinical study. A natural approach to training involves learning this from a large dataset of patient records, where patient-level eligibility status has ground truth labels.\n\n- **Trial-level task**\n- The second task is to predict trial-level eligibility, which is different from patient-level eligibility. This information is used when patients participate in a clinical study, for example in trials with no or few patients, or when some patients from the same trial are excluded by other factors (smoking, allergic to drugs, etc. ...). The model will give an estimate on the likelihood of a patient referring to clinical trial, without a time-constraint. For this task, we can also obtain a trial's eligibility assessments.\n\n### Pipeline:\nWe recommend to design a pipeline to train the models. Pipeline is defined as a set of models, data-pre/processing methods, and hyperparameters, that we train for better results. This pipeline can help us to avoid the time consuming task of searching for new data-pre/processing methods for extracting the information that our neural network needs to make a better prediction.\nPipeline:\n```\n- read in notes from Pubmed - remove columns not important and store data to the dataframe\n- use a preprocessing method - for example remove stopwords\n- use some feature extraction method, for example TF-IDF\n- use the dataframe, and the",

The most common respiratory pathogens were rhinovirus (45%) and respiratory syncytial virus (34%). No major differences were found between antibiotic and clinical follow-up groups. The average age was 5 years in the antibiotic group and 4,6 years in the clinical follow-up group. Those older than 4 years had a higher chance of requiring antibiotic treatment. The length of stay was longer in antibiotic-treated patients (4,4 versus 2,8 days, p=0,01). Patients admitted to the hospital had a significantly worse outcome (p<0,001).

His liver biopsy findings were consistent with acute allograft rejection, and he was given steroid intravenously for that indication. His serum alkaline phosphatase level increased significantly within a day, which prompted review of previous radiographs. Radiographs revealed radiolucencies within the liver graft with no perfusion in segments II to III, thus indicating complete thrombosis. The patient underwent transjugular liver biopsy, which revealed extensive macrovesicular steatosis without evidence of thrombus. Due to poor clinical response to steroids and elevated liver enzymes, the decision was eventually made to return the patient to the operating room for an urgent retransplantation.

The tissues comprising tendons are called tensional connective tissues, and the cellular component in these are called tenocytes.\n\n# Tendon development\nAs the body grows, the long bones form at their ends, and in order to allow the muscles to attach to them, the tendons must develop. The formation of the tendons consists of three steps, all of which are called tendon differentiation.\n\n## Proliferation\nThe tenocytes proliferate during the proliferative phase.\n\n## Differentiation\nThe tenocytes differentiate into types that can be distinguished by their shape as follows:\n- Fibroblasts, which are the majority of the tenocytes. They attach themselves to the end of the tendon and begin to produce various substances which make up the extracellular matrix. The major substances produced by the fibroblasts are collagen, elastin, and proteoglycan.\n- Chondrions, which develop into fibrous cartilage. They provide the scaffold for the tendon, like cartilage provides the scaffold of bones.\n- Osteoblasts, which develop into bone. These develop into Haversian systems which are the spaces in which blood vessels travel through the tendon to supply blood to the cells and make sure there is transport of waste from the cells.\n- Myoblasts, which differentiate into myocytes, and then eventually develop into muscle fibres.\nIf there is a tendon which is not utilised, or one which is not needed any longer, then the cells will enter apoptosis and slowly degenerate, usually taking about 65 years.\n\n## Tendon maturity\nAfter the tendon has been fully-formed, then it enters a phase of growth called the maturing",

During one session, participants were asked to smoke only 1 cigarette at 1 hour, and during the other session, they received a moderate dose of alcohol (0.5 mg of alcohol per kilogram of person weight) or placebo. Smoking, urge scores, and craving ratings and effects were reported. The craving task consisted of two phases: an anticipatory phase, where smokers were presented with cigarettes and then received instructions on how to prepare for the experiment, and a cue-elicited phase, where 30 pictures related to smoking were sequentially presented.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistical comparisons within subjects revealed a significant decrease in the smoking rate and in the urge scores during the first hour (p < .001). Furthermore, a significant reduction of smoking rate was observed in sessions with alcohol relative to a session with placebo (p = .049). However, a significant reduction in the urge scores only reached in the cue-elicited phase (p = .040). Also, alcohol had a significant effect on craving intensity (p = .041).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study demonstrated that administration of a moderate dose of alcohol reduced urge levels as well as the smoking rate in daily smokers, and this was evident during the anticipatory and cue-elicited phases.<EOD> Comparison of 1% and 2% intravenous lidocaine infusion for postoperative analgesia in thyroid surgery: A randomized",

The patients were subsequently followed up for six months, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant variables predicting the following outcome variables: death within six months, stroke recurrence within six months (any brain infarct), and death plus stroke recurrence during six months. Sixty-three percent of the patients had an ischaemic stroke and 37% had a haemorrhagic stroke. The risk of dying in patients diagnosed as having a TIA at admission was higher than in patients without previous TIA (50% versus 30%, p<0.05).

MF59 is a squalene-based emulsion, whereas alum is aluminium hydroxide alone. AF03 is a potent, safe, non-toxic adjuvant for preventive and therapeutic vaccines to protect against virulent viruses, bacteria and/or parasites. AF03-adjuvanted whole virus vaccines protect mice against virulent viruses or bacteria, as well as providing prophylactic and therapeutic (sterilizing and non-sterilizing) protection against malaria parasites and leishmaniasis. AF03 adjuvanted whole-cell vaccines were shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria-induced mortality by inducing a robust antibody response, while concomitantly inducing regulatory CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells that prevented the over-reaction observed in non-vaccinated sick mice. The AF03-adjuvanted wholecell S. typhi vaccine has been shown to protect children against typhoid infection; clinical studies of this vaccine are in progress. In this study, AF03 was compared with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant for the development of novel preventive/ treatment vaccines.Methods AF03 was compared with alum adjuvant in C57BL/6 and 129 Sv/Ev mice for its abilities to generate long-lasting and high-titer antibody responses to tetanus toxoid, influenza, measles, hepatitis B, plague, Ebola virus (EBOV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis, West Nile virus (WNV) and plasmodium falciparum antigens.

Relevance of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome in multiple sclerosis. North Clin. Istanb. 2021; 8(5): 494-501.The gut microbiota has been described to play a fundamental role with the pathogenesis of neurological and immunological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). According to some studies, the composition of gut microbiome influences the immune system also by modulating the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier, bacterial metabolites, proinflammatory cytokine levels and antibody response. In this context, it can be hypothesized that a dysbiotic gut microbiota can contribute to the development of MS through a proinflammatory environment. Further findings suggest that MS patients show also dysbiosis involving the whole gut. It was observed a reduced microbiome alpha diversity in MS patients, that is associated with both severity of the disease and gastrointestinal symptoms. Interestingly, there is evidence of altered bacterial populations in MS with an increased prevalence of the Bacteroides genus, and depletion of Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia species during relapse. The knowledge gained in understanding the role of gut microbiota in MS has led to novel therapeutic strategies, including microbiome alteration by probiotic intervention. Currently, there are no probiotics clinically validated for the treatment of MS, but clinical trials of probiotics supplementation are ongoing in MS patients. Probiotics, also referred as 'beneficial bacteria', are non-pathogenic bacteria that are proposed to have, under certain circumstances, beneficial effects on health. Therefore, studies will be necessary to show the beneficial effects and to assess their safety profile, in both preclinical and clinical studies, to use probiotics as a supplementary",

Amrubicin showed potent cytotoxicity to the human multiple myeloma cell lines U266, NCI-H929, and KMS-12-PE by inhibiting the expression of genes encoding multiple myeloma-associated proteins.

We report here that gains in chromosome 3p detected by comparative genomic hybridization are always associated both with overexpression and amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In turn, overexpression and amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor were not consistently seen in cell lines bearing only 3p loss of heterozygosity on microsatellite markers. These findings may suggest that either amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene is sufficient to induce expression on its own or that only a specific subset of cancers with 3p loss of heterozygosity undergo selection for amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. We also found that overexpression of the 15 to 20 kb of RNA encompassing the erbB-2 gene (c-erbB-2 gene) is associated with gain of sequence polymorphism at D3S1235. In summary, the identification of specific molecular defects within gene-coding sequences in specific breast tumors might be instrumental for designing better clinical trials for therapeutic use of targeted agents.<EOD> A method of measuring the strength of the refractive index mismatch between the cell and the surrounding liquid: the \"cavity method\".\nA simple and fast method for measuring the refractive index of immersed cells or fibre sections is described which is called 'the cavity method'.

To meet this requirement for total bromate (BrO(3)- + BrO(2-)) we developed a high-throughput method for total bromate determination by a commercially available liquid chromatograph (LC) with a diode-array detector (DAD) integrated into an automation system. We evaluated nine sample preparation techniques and compared 5 commercial bromate calibration standards for their suitability to prepare calibration curves and to carry out external quality control using our sample preparation procedure.

PTSD is prevalent in primary care settings after road traffic accident, where approximately 25% of patients meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the development of a number of efficacious behavioral and pharmacological treatments, only a minority of patients with PTSD receive mental health services. PTSD is frequently underrecognized and untreated in Emergency Department and Surgical Unit.~Then, early diagnosis and prevention of PTSD might help to identify patients with PTSD high risk and lead them to benefit of personalized cares.

These drugs are known to improve survival in many cancers, including cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, breast, kidney, and GI stromal tumors (GIST). Worldwide, over 400,000 patients per year are treated with one of these agents. HFS involves skin changes, such as swelling, peeling, and blistering of the palms and soles, which is often painful and debilitating. As a result, HFS-related symptoms can frequently lead to dose reduction and/or discontinuation of otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment. There is no treatment for HFS other than dose reduction or stopping treatment.

        "output": "__\n__\n\n## Precision\nNow what is this phrase 'precision'?\nPrecision refers to the likelihood that the study findings of a clinical trial will be the same when repeated. As the precision is enhanced, the study results are trustworthy. Conversely, the larger the extent of variation of the findings, the less accurate and less reliable the results.\nPrecision in research indicates how much a study's result can differ from the truth. For example, although the average weight of the fruits and vegetables picked from a fruit shop could be determined as 350.00 gram, the weight measurements from each vendor could be very different, if the measurements were taken at different time periods--that is the consequence of precision loss. Therefore the degree of loss is one of the features of precision.\nThere are three kinds of precision that are usually considered:\n- accuracy reflects the closeness of the measured quantity to the true value;\n- consistency indicates the consistency of the repeated measurements; and\n- repeatability is concerned with the repeatability of a study for the same result.\nIn this section, the focus is on the repeatability test. You can find out more information about the other aspects of the precision in [link1]. [LINK1].\n\n## Repeatability\nThe repeatability is concerned with the repeatability of a study for the same result. Repeatability provides an estimate of the closeness of the results of a study. In other words, it is the ability of a study to detect a change in patient condition or a change of patient's response for the study drugs.\nFor the repeatability of a clinical study, the test and its repeatability study are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nRepeatability:\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{1}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{X1}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{2}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{X2}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{a}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{Xa}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X} \\label{repeatability-1}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV_{21}}}{\\mathrm{dV",

The present study was designed to address this issue.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThirty-seven patients with MI (24 anterior MI, 13 inferior MI) and 26 healthy subjects (HS) with normal coronary arteries were examined. The internal and external diameters of the ascending aorta and the mean circumferential thickness of the ascending aorta wall were measured in transverse ascending axial images. The wall thickness (WTh) was calculated by dividing the wall circumference diameter by the calculated cross-sectional area. The ascending cross-sectional area was approximated by multiplying the aortic internal diameter by a constant (0.72). We found significant differences in the ascending aortic dimensions between the MI and HS groups. The differences in the aortic internal and external diameters between the groups were due to higher values in the MI group. There was no difference in the WTh between the MI and HS groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results indicate that different alterations in aortic and cardiac dimensions are evident in MI patients in association with their different heart failure conditions. Increased ascending aortic diameters in MI patients do not appear to result from increased aortic wall thickness, but from an increase in aortic diameter caused by increased aortic perimeter length.<EOD> The",

In addition, A-A. platensis supplementation had no visible effect on the intestinal characteristics of pigs such as body weight, total body weight gain, gastrointestinal transit time and rectal temperature.Conclusions: This study reveals, for the first time, the influence of A-A. platensis on intestinal microbiota without any side-effects on livestock and piglet growth.

In recent years, the morbidity and mortality rates of CHF have been steadily increasing, which is also a public health problem.\nClinically, CHF is usually divided into four stages according to the severity of the heart disease. However, the pathogenesis of CHF is complex, and each patient has a different CHF severity.\nPlatelets (PLTs) play a role in both the progression and prognosis of CHF. Numerous studies have indicated that an imbalance in the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is a well-defined prognostic marker in patients with CHF.\nAtherosclerosis is an immune response disorder, and platelets appear to be active participants in atherosclerosis. The PLT count, a routine haemogram test, may reflect the activity of atherosclerosis. Many crosssectional and longitudinal studies have linked an elevated PLT count with an increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation and clinical vascular events. Some studies have also reported a strong positive correlation between PLT counts and atherosclerosis-related markers such as C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide .\nIn addition to the classic role of PLTs in thrombosis, growing attention is being paid to the contribution of PLTs through the release of PLT microparticles (PMPs) to atherosclerosis. PLT microparticles (PMPs) are small (1-2 \u00b5m) membranous vesicles derived from the plasma membrane of activated PLTs, which contain a cell-type transcriptionally active nucleus.\nAs a bioactive mediator, PLT microparticles have been shown to promote inflammatory cell activation.\nAn increasing",

Metazoan mtDNA ranges in size from~20 kb in nematodes to~16 kb in humans. In addition to core mitochondrial gene products, mtDNA also encodes 37 tRNAs, 22 transfer-mRNAs, and 12 short open-reading frames (ORFs) that have no annotated function but do encode transcripts and proteins in nematodes, teleost fishes (12 ORFs), and mammals (15 ORFs).

Efforts to understand and prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are hampered by a lack of high throughput assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. The only available tests to date use either low-resolution immunofluorescence or radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods that use recombinant protein fragments as antigens. These assays do not have the necessary throughput and the fragment antigen approach precludes detection of antibodies that target conformational epitopes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a high throughput 4-plex quantitative Luminex assay using full-length antigens and a unique peptide-based blocking strategy. The assay demonstrates robust seropositivity over a broad dynamic range and is a useful tool for estimating the fraction of the population with active antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. More broadly, this assay is an efficient platform for evaluating the kinetics, persistence, and antigenic coverage of humoral immune responses to human pathogens.\nT he novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has precipitated pandemic disease that has affected tens of millions of people worldwide and over 140,000 in the US .

Many of these events were initiated by pathogens in urban settings via interaction with human pathogens. These spillover events are of particular interest due to potential impacts on host populations and ecosystem structure. Here we examine the role of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a human-to-wildlife spillover pathogen from a palaeocological perspective. We compare the natural history of SARS-CoV-1, the putative zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, and its natural hosts to the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 and its natural host. Results indicate both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 fit the criteria for having a natural wildlife reservoir as these viruses have been sporadically detected for over a decade with no clear indicators of cross-species extinction. We note that the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the extent of the pandemic across wild and domestic environments, its global impact on the human population, and the fact the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified (and thus our ability to determine pre-existing evolutionary differences between natural hosts). Overall, the novel virus may have evolved to take advantage of anthropogenic-related changes in humans, bats and livestock as these taxa are important in human diets, trade and consumption; further, as such, SARS-CoV-2 may be well adapted to the global trade of humans and livestock. The importance of such a zoonotic spillover in bats and possibly pangolins is likely to be underappreciated in comparison to other wildlife taxa that may have suffered similar exposures. Ultimately, SARS-CoV-2, like many other viruses, may become a resident of the human population as it continues to evolve.Publisher'",

What is the optimal approach?\nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, with more than 182,000 new cases predicted to occur in 2003. Fortunately, most prostate cancers are indolent; the 10-year survival rate with this diagnosis exceeds 95%.1,2 However, this favorable outcome is derived from the fact that most men die with, not of, prostate cancer. Although prostate-specific antigen testing has increased the detection of disease, the proportion of men with clinically localized disease has remained unchanged.3,4 When prostate-specific antigen screening was introduced in the 1980s, most cancers in men older than 60 years were diagnosed at an early stage.5 Although it is generally thought that screening has resulted in a shift in prostate-cancer frequency from the disseminated stages to the more favorable clinical localized stages, no direct assessment has been made.5 In one study6 of the effect of prostate-specific antigen testing on prostate-cancer outcomes, the proportion of cancers diagnosed at early stages increased from 45% in 1986-1989 to 67% in 1994-1998 (62% to 75% in the subset at highest risk for the",

The phosphate-bound imipramine does not react with chlorpromazine, an indicator of tricyclic antidepressant-like drugs. The results are in line with the observed difference in the side effects of phosphate and imipramine and demonstrate the possibility of spectroscopic studies to distinguish different forms of imipramine.<EOD> A novel mutation in the KMT2D gene that causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS)\n\nBackground: Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) is a rare disorder with a presumed prevalence of approximately 1/1,000,000.

For people with SCD who do not respond to the available pharmaceutical products, the ability to prepare compounded medications by pharmacists can be beneficial. When prescribing a compounded medication, it is important to understand the indications, pharmacological properties, preparation techniques, and potential complications. Case Reports: Here, we describe 3 patients with SCD who have been receiving regular treatment with either a combination of hydroxyurea and crizanlizumab, hydroxyurea, or  hydroxyurea at the Specialty Pharmacy of Saint Mary's Center for Special Education (Phoenix, Arizona), where 3 different pharmacists prepared the compounded solutions. All 3 patients had previously been using their prescriptions through their health plan but elected to change to a compounded solution prepared by a compounding pharmacist because they were dissatisfied with the health plan's formulary product as it resulted in poor adherence and nonresponders. Two of these patients were on combination therapy, and the other patient was on monotherapy. This decision to compound a medication for these patients was an improvement in the care they were receiving compared with what they had been receiving. Conclusion: By understanding the indications, pharmacological properties, preparation techniques, and potential complications of compounded medications used to treat SCD, compounding pharmacists can effectively treat patients when necessary.<EOD> Reversal in the trends of the association between diabetes mellitus and stroke among Korean adults.\nThis study examined trends in the burden of diabetes mellitus and stroke among the Korean population.

In response to growth factors and cytokines, RTKs generate multiple intracellular signaling pathways involving protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Rho family of small GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) are well-known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, the activity of which is crucial for the formation and dynamics of various cellular compartments. These proteins are involved in the modulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, membrane protein sorting, adhesion and migration. Rho proteins play an important role in the regulation of RTKs: they link the signals from receptors and their direct downstream targets, such as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ERK1/2, Src kinases and PI3K, to the actin cytoskeleton. Rho proteins also regulate the RTK activity through a direct binding with the components of the receptor signaling system, which leads to a change in the phosphorylation status of receptors by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, Rho proteins act as a link between the receptor signaling",

Most nociceptive information is carried to the brain as action potentials traveling along nonmyelinated (unmyelinated) nociceptive fibers (e.g., C-fibers), while pain elicited by intense acute noxious stimuli is transmitted as action potentials along A-delta fibers. In some pain models, such as the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain, injured A-fiber and C-fiber nociceptive terminals undergo plasmalemmal blebbing and swelling, which is consistent with irreversible cell damage occurring in these structures, but little neuroinflammation. Although the mechanisms responsible for such degenerative changes are not fully known, one likely contributor is increased cytoplasmic calcium flux that occurs in neuronal degenerative disease, trauma, and ischemia. In a recent study, activation of a calcium-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptor on spinal nociceptive terminals contributed to the development of mechanical hypersensitivity following spinal nerve ligation, but did not affect the severity of hyperalgesia to an algogen, suggesting that calcium-mediated secondary injury mechanisms influence nociceptive processing only when the nerve is chronically injured. Because the loss of nociceptive input from injured nerves or the use of calcium channel blockers can relieve neuropathic pain and suppress activity of central pain-sensitizing neurons, increased calcium could be a primary initiating event in nerve-injury-induced neural plasticity in both noc",

It is also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.~Studies have shown that hypothyroidism increased the risk of COVID-19 composite poor outcomes. This study also aimed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement therapy was effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of COVID-19, and in improving the severity of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related complications.~Now the question is: Will this patient meet the requirements of the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial?

The study revealed the possibility and expediency of increasing the prognostic accuracy of primary tumor infiltration into the bone marrow by examination of its biopsy material. The value of a bioptic examination of the biopsy material was confirmed by the study of the prognostic parameters of the tumor with the evaluation of the extent of its invasion into the bone marrow and a prognosis of the malignancy based on the biopsy specimen.

Although the negative selection process has been studied for over 30 yr, how this selection is accomplished has been a continuing enigma. The role of HLA-DM in this negative selection process is a contentious issue. Expression of HLA-DM in thymus was initially reported to be undetectable, and several studies argued that HLA-DM is not required for central tolerance. However, we have shown that HLA-DM and MHC class II accumulate in cortex and medulla, respectively, during thymic maturation, suggesting that thymocytes are subject to both the positive and negative selection processes. Surprisingly, transcriptionally regulated expression of HLA-DM in thymus was shown to be low, but detectable. However, expression of HLA-DM in thymus is not low enough to support the theory that DM-DM interactions do not take place during thymic selection process. This review summarizes previously published work including our more recent finding on the expression of HLA-DM and its potential regulation in mouse thymus.<EOD> Hydrogen Peroxide Activation of the Relevant Ion Channels and Receptors under Physiological Conditions\n\nThe primary reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) with iron proteins is well known. However, the peroxide can react with many other molecules or biological structures leading to a modification of their functions. The activation of specific ion channels by H 2 O 2 represents a new mechanism of signaling and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. These channels belong to cationic channels: TRPA1, TRPV1-V4, TRPM2, and TRPV2. In particular, H 2 O 2 activation of the cationic channels TRPA1 and TRPV1-4 is crucial for sensory transduction, cardiac contractility, and cell damage via apoptosis. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 activation of TRPM2 leads to calcium influx, which results in the activation of downstream signal",

Fall frequency ranges from 19% to 66%. The incidence of falls in patients with MS has been reported to occur in up to 66% of MS patients, although this varies widely from person to person. Fear of falling is a significant psychosocial condition that decreased level of physical performance and quality of life in middle-aged and elderly adults, and might be related to falls. A recent study showed that the odds ratio in elderly people was 8.3 (CI 95%), and that falls, in turn, doubled the risk of being overweight and of having hypertension.\nThe most common causes of falls in individuals with MS are loss of balance and muscle weakness. The causes of falls in MS are related to motor disorders, cognitive disability, fatigue, and visual and sensory-motor deficit. Balance in an upright posture is maintained through the integration of visual, muscular, and neuronal proprioceptive information. Muscles involved in balance are the biceps, quadriceps, calf muscles, abdominal muscles, and gluteus medius during weight-bearing exercises; these muscles are very important for balance and gait.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n## Participants\nParticipants were selected based on the criteria previously definedfor the study; all underwent a neurological evaluation based on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and a questionnaire for screening of MS.

The regulation of 15-PGDH expression and function is not known, but we hypothesized that 15-PGDH expression increased during the inflammatory phase of the injury repair and carcinogenesis processes, and decreased during the resolution phase. Our recent study demonstrated inhibition of the mouse 15-PGDH promoter by the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway. In this study, we found that the steroid receptor coactivator 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PPARGC1A) have a positive effect on the mouse 15-PGDH promoter activity. We determined that PPARGC1A mediated the estrogen receptor-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1)-induced transactivation of the 15-PGDH promoter via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We developed a mouse chondrocyte cell line by utilizing the 15-PGDH promoter driven the human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 E7 as an oncogene. The ERR\u03b1-expressing cells had a higher cell survival rate than control cells. We speculate that the reduction of the 15-PGDH levels, and concomitant increase in the PGE2 levels via PPARGC1A and ERR\u03b1, may result in a reduction of the inflammatory response associated with tissue repair and tumor progression.<EOD> Development and Characterization of 3D-Printed Flexible Sensors as High Performance Tools for Intrapartum Electronic Fetal Membrane Rupture Diagnosis",

The trial is looking for patients with cancer. The age factor of patients has the same value for both the first and second conditions. Therefore, since the value of each age factor in the first condition matches the patient note, it is '0' if the clinical trial includes age factor. In the second condition, the values for each age factor are inconsistent with the patient note. Thus this condition is '1' if clinical trial uses age as an inclusion criteria. \n\nExplanation\nThis example shows the difference between positive and negative criteria. The left condition shows the example for positive criteria whereas the right condition shows the example for negative criteria.\n\n## [INST]\nHere is a positive criterion and we have to judge whether the value of a criterion is a match or a mismatch for each patient's value of that criterion. The patient's value of the criterion matches the value of that criterion. Thus this condition is 0 if the clinical trial uses the age factor. \nHere is a negative criterion and we have to determine 0 or 1. The negative criterion has a true value or a false value. The true value matches with the patient's value of the clinical trial's criterion. Otherwise, the false value is mismatched with the patient's value of a criterion. \nTherefore, the output of this task will be `Trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial`.\n\n# Exercise\nTry running this example on Anaconda.\n\n# Exercise\nLet's try running this example on Anaconda.\n\n# TASK 1\nInput a patient note and a trial note: \n- patient-note: ```{\n    'note': \"\\nA 25-year-old woman presents to the clinic\\n\\ncomplaining of prolonged fatigue.

As with the clinical trial eligibility, we define this task as a function of patient as `get_assay_level_eligibility_note(): ` so that you can output the eligibility assessments of a patient for all the clinical trials and finally get the patient_level_eligibility for each patient.\n\nFirst, the assay-level data are needed; therefore, the patients' assay-level data are loaded. We load the data that are contained in the columns `Id`,`assay_ID`,`patient-ID`, and `value` in the `assay_data` data frame. We do not load the columns that are not needed such as `name`(see Code 2, Line 10),which results in speeding up the loading of the data. After loading the assay-level data, you need to define the functions `assay_level_eligibility_notes()` and `patient_level_eligibility()` which should be used to output the assay-level eligibility-assessment and patient-level eligibility. The patient_level_eligibility provides you assay-level eligibilities for each patient. For example, a patient could have assay-level eligibility for some clinical trials but not for others. At a glance, based on the code you can see that the process can be divided into three parts: 1) The load of the clinical trials and assay data including the data frame construction; 2) the definition of the functions `assay_level_eligibility_note()`, `patient_level_eligibility()` and`assay_data.columns()` to output the assay_level and patient_leve eligibility from the data frame columns; and 3) the output of the assay_data.columns and the data frames `clinical_trials` and `patients`.\nFinally, `",

Although bortezomib improves the overall survival of patients with various hematopoietic malignancies, some patients develop resistance and the disease is recurrent in most cases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show promising anticancer effects on malignancies, and the ability of these agents to improve conventional therapies such as bortezomib may serve as an effective strategy for overcoming therapeutic limitations. This study tested combination regimens, using LBH589, on leukemia cell lines representing normal/nonmalignant and malignant cells of all major hematopoietic lineages and on primary leukemia cells. LBH589 plus bortezomib had synergistic cytotoxic effects on both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. LBH589 treatment induced a decrease in the expression of bcl-2, survivin, and xIAP and a simultaneous increase in the expression of death ligands by upregulation of TRAIL and downregulation of cFlip by downregulation of \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. This study demonstrates that LBH589 in combination with bortezomib represents a novel therapeutic strategy against hematopoietic malignancies.<EOD> Role of TP-5 in prevention of the side effects of long-term oral opioid therapy in children and adults.\nThe goal of this prospective, randomized and controlled, open-label, trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose TP-5 in the prevention of constipation and the development of dependence (opioid bowel syndrome) in long-term oral opioid therapy.

In Silico Simulation of the Diffusion of a Nanoparticle in a Membrane. Nanomaterials\n\n# Introduction\nIn the past decades, our understanding of biological systems, as well as their applications in medicine, have been increased with the use of nanoparticles (NPs). These structures include many types of compounds: organic and inorganic material; spherical and cylindrical; biometric and non-biometric shapes; nanowires; nanotubes, nanospheres, etc. Each of these types of compounds includes structures with different sizes and degrees of biocompatibility, which are used to perform specific tasks.\nIn medicine, the main function of nanoparticles is to deliver a specific drug with the highest efficiency. Due to the great size of the NPs in comparison with the cellular structures, NPs have a great advantage in terms of improving solubility and bioavailability, and the stability of the administered drug. The high flexibility and ease of modification are also attractive features in the field of drug design . These NPs can also target specific cellular markers on tumor cells, allowing selective intracellular delivery of the drug and avoiding harmful effects on healthy cells. Another type of nanoparticle is the organic liposome. These NPs are used in the transport of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules due to their structure [bib_ref]  Nanoparticle delivery of cancer drugs, Wang [/bib_ref] .\nNanoparticles have many functions and applications in daily life.

OTEIS is used for collecting and organizing a variety of trial-related information, ranging from demographic details to information about adverse events that may develop in patients during and after taking a drug.\nOTEIS has six categories of data:\nSubject demographic\nBaseline data\nDrug administrations\nInvestigator assessments\nMedical events\nSafety events\nYou are called by the new site coordinator to help them prepare for the first session of training. The coordinator explains that she has been through the basics of operating OTEIS and has been taught by the data manager, a pharmacist with many years of experience. When the coordinator talks with you, she tells you that the data manager said it was very important to ensure that the computer did not have too many errors for patient data entry so they could get into the habit of double-checking patient data before the trial starts. The coordinator is especially concerned about the number of data entry errors that the data manager said they encountered, and so you need to figure out a suitable approach to helping her avoid entering incorrect data into OTEIS. \n       \nA site coordinator is required to input eligible subjects into the system, by manually entering their study ID into the OTEIS system and then selecting all the appropriate demographic information. The coordinator needs to enter certain subjects' medications and any adverse events, and then double-check the information. OTEIS uses a barcode scanner to link electronic data with data on paper. The coordinator needs to scan a bar code and enter information on paper for all subjects. When entering the data, the coordinator can make a final review of everything that has been entered to date to see if anyone",

What should you do to improve the proportion of eligible patients?\nYou should develop a strategy to improve this problem. You should consider the number of potentially eligible patients, the number of eligible patients on entering the trial, and the number of patients participating in the trial. Let's begin.\n\nThere are 1000 patients attending the clinics of your clinical trial sponsor, including 350 patients attending your clinic. Among these patients, 200 patients are eligible according to the trial's eligibility criteria. Among them, 1 out of every 10 eligible patients participates in the clinical trial. The other 9/10 eligible patients do not participate due to several factors. We discuss two of these factors.\n\nYou plan to study the following two factors:\n\n### Factor A\n\nThis factor is related to an adverse event, such as a patient's hospital stay. If the stay is longer than the standard admission time, the patient cannot be recruited into the trial. This factor is called a trial-specific eligibility factor.\n\n### Factor B\n\nThis factor is related to the trial. This factor is called a clinic-specific eligibility factor.\n\nYour sponsor wants to improve the trial enrollment rate. What should you, as an employee of the clinic, propose to increase the rate of eligible patients who complete the clinical trial?\n    * First, develop a strategy based only on Factor A.\n\n[INST] You should consider the number of potentially eligible patients, the number of eligible patients on entering the trial, and the number of patients participating in the trial. This is similar to the question you were just asked.\n\nYou think that some of the eligible patients cannot participate in the trial because of extra costs incurred between the clinical trial and their admission time.

In addition, datasets are provided to support reproducibility.\n\n## Benchmarking data set\nTo benchmark [2,16] a range of techniques, an original synthetic data set is designed. Each sample is generated by a generative process that depends on the chosen model. The design of the dataset is inspired by the real problems of this article and the use case data set of [2,16], but contains no private or sensitive human data. The data set is provided as `Example_dataset.txt` in the [data folder](https://github.com/zhangjianqiang/clinical-trial-eligibility-assessment/tree/main/data).

First, a data set of 500 samples is initialized with synthetic random seeds. Sequences containing 3 variables are generated for two datasets (patients and study). The generator of the first dataset (patient data) assigns variables between 0 and 1 (12 variables) and the generator of the second dataset (study data) assigns variables between 0 and 130 (6 variables) with 87 as the mean. A uniform distribution is generated uniformly for all variables in the first dataset and the normal distribution is generated for variables from 50 to 500 in the second dataset. After that, the generator generates categorical variables by randomly selecting values from set variables. For example, variables 32 and 266 are generated to variables 1 and 0, respectively, and thus the categorical variables have a frequency of 1. Similarly, the generative data set is extended to 200 samples by the same process, and a second random seed is provided.\n\n\n```r\ndatGen <- function(seed){\n  d <- rep(NA, n = 500)\n  d[1:12] <- rnorm(1",

The COVID-19 disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since become a major outbreak on a global scale, leading to an official announcement of the new pandemic and a name of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The most common symptoms in infected cases are similar to those in patients with seasonal flu such as dry cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. However, since the COVID-19 disease is newly found in humans without any previous exposure to the virus, it is still not known why the virus causes severe life-threating pneumonia in some patients and not in others, and what are the major risk factors for being infected. Since it was not possible to collect lung biopsies in living patients, a series of public collections of high-resolution CT (HRCT) images were released in the framework of the COVID-19 Radiography Synthesis and Evaluation (CoRaSE), a part of the COVID-19 CLEAR initiative by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The goal of the CoRaSE challenge and this task is to automate the evaluation and scoring of COVID-19 disease severity based on the HRCT scan.  This task contains two sub-tasks: assessment of CORADS scores (CoRADS) and severity scores (CADSS) for each patient. CORADS scores are defined based on radiologic findings. Specifically, a chest radiograph is evaluated by the following three-digit scoring system: (1) COMMUNICATION (CO) refers to presence of a clear, easily recognizable, and definite pattern, mostly pneumonia on the radiographs.

Oxytocin is the most common uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recently recommended a single 100mcg dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent post partum hemorrhage (PPH), in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of carbetocin has not yet been published. The investigators hypothesize that the minimum effective dose (ED90) is above 20mcgs and below 80mcgs in women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAll patients planned for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.\nAll patients who give written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level elig",

At present the standard care of hospitalized children with bronchiolitis is oxygen via nasal prongs. In this study the investigators would like to compare standard ward management with a new method of delivering oxygen called high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNOT). HFNOT involves breathing warmed, moistened oxygen through nasal cannulae at a flow rate of 8 liters/minute.

Eight tests were considered: 1. Clinical history (70 cases). 2. Clinical acuity (70 cases). 3. Clinical visual acuity (80 cases). 4. Colour discrimination (45 cases). 5. Vision field defects (71 cases). 6. Accommo-dation (40 cases). 7. Objective refraction (30 patients). 8. Retinoscopy (30 patients). The tests gave fair to good reliability coefficients except in the case of the refraction tests which may have given better reliability but were considered unsuitable. For the nonmedical group the average reliability coefficient was 0.7 for medical graduates, 0.4 for science graduates and 0.6 for science graduates with prior experience of ophthalmology. The average reliability coefficient for ophthalmologists after 5 tests had been done was 0.8. There was no consistent correlation between tests in groups of cases. There was good agreement between the scores given by medical graduates of different types of course in 2 out of 8 tests. In the other 6 the differences were not considered significant. There was no evidence that the average ophthalmologist had a better score than the various groups of test takers. It was concluded that: 1. Scores on the tests used showed the same tendency to disagreement as those found in other studies, and, that there was no good evidence of an improvement in the results with experience. Therefore, there was no reliable evidence of a correlation between scores and ability or lack of ability on the test. 2. Although the test results could be improved by giving preliminary training, it was not found possible to devise a valid and reliable score. Therefore, the tests did not appear to be satisfactory instruments for pre-registration evaluation or selection of students for pre-registration work. 3",

Although pulmonary disease may develop in patients with CLL, it is a rare complication of the disease and is often overlooked. In addition, pulmonary complications may occur in the absence of classical B cell lymphocytosis. We present here a rare case of a 64year-old female patient with a 1-year history of non-productive cough, fatigue and decreased exercise capacity. A chest radiograph was compatible with a multifocal pneumonia. A lung biopsy was performed to investigate the cause of these symptoms; no classical histological features of CLL could be identified on the biopsy. CLL was finally diagnosed after positive B-lymphocyte immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first case of atypical pulmonary involvement of CLL diagnosed by histopathological demonstration of lymphocyte infiltration in the lung parenchyma and its successful treatment by rituximab.\n\n# Background\nChronic lymphocyt",

It was prepared because of widespread interest in the postoperative metabolic complications of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB). However, the literature on this subject is full of confusing and conflicting results, some of which are reviewed. Our own data have resulted from a randomized study of 20 patients with severe mitral insufficiency who were operated on with or without CPB between 1964 and 1969. The first three patients (all without CPB) were followed clinically and metabolically on a number of occasions postoperatively; the other 17 patients were followed similarly (for a shorter time) postoperatively, but without being given any special diet or drugs. The serum glucose values and the urinary excretion of glucose and 17-ketosteroids are analysed after recovery from surgery and up to the 7th postoperative day. The results show that in both groups of patients there is a postoperative hyperglycaemia which recovers only slowly after about 3 days. Postoperatively, the patients without bypass have a higher urinary excretion of glucose and the glucose concentration is higher in their urine. The postoperative results of these patients are not due to the surgical stress alone, but are connected with the nutritional aspect of the CPB group and the more severe operative trauma in the open group.

The rash was pruritic, and he was initially treated with clindamycin. However, the lesions persisted and new lesions subsequently developed over his back. In addition to the pigmented lesions, the patient complained of hair loss, which the dermatologist suspected was telogen effluvium. He was treated with steroids at his dermatologist's request, but the rash persisted.\nPhysical examination revealed well-demarcated areas of discrete hyperpigmentation, ranging from 2 to 3 cm in diameter, on the patient's cheeks, forehead, and back . Dermoscopy showed a network of white lines. Histopathology from the back showed an increased number of Langerhans cells, consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The results of biopsies from his cheek and forehead also revealed LCH and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. The number of melanophages was also decreased in the patient's skin biopsy specimen. The patient did not have a familial history of similar pigmentary abnormalities. He denied experiencing any additional symptoms, including fever, weight loss, diarrhea, cough, or fatigue.\n\n# Discussion\nOur patient presented with hyperpigmented lesions and hair loss. Based on our biopsy results, he was diagnosed with LCH. LCH is a rare oral pathology that can affect the",

In particular, information on age and gender, as well as the exact date of injury, was requested from the mentioned data sets (Figure 1).

This was evident in the univariate analysis (i.e., without adjustment; p = 0.009). The proportion increased from the 1st to the 2nd course and then decreased to a lower level. The 1st course also took place in significantly less time, i.e., more frequently during the winter months, compared to the 2nd and 3rd courses. There was no evidence that the time of the injury increased between course repetitions. In a follow-up model including the duration of the ski course, the proportions by course repetition remained unchanged (Model 1). However, the duration of the ski course did not change the proportion over time, i.e., from the 1st to the 2nd and to the 3rd course repetitions.\nThe age of the participants was significantly younger in the 1st course than in the courses repeated 2 and 3 times.

However, the effect of postoperative lymphocyte immune response on prognosis has not been adequately examined. Therefore, we investigated the effect of lymphopenia and prophylactic abdominal binder wearing on postoperative immunological function and prognosis. Methods: This retrospective study investigated 80 patients who underwent open pancreaticoduodenectomy in the pancreatic surgery clinic of the authors and were diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma. Lymphocyte and neutrophil counts within 24 h after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy were examined for all the 80 patients. Results: Postoperative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were significantly lower than preoperative values. The proportion of patients with lymphocyte counts<1200/\u03bcL was 52.5% at 0 -6 h, 20% at 6 -12 h, and 10% at 12 -24 h after the operation; the median time of onset for lymphopenia was 12 h. Patients with preoperative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts 1200/\u03bcL or higher had significantly lower lymphocyte and neutrophil counts after surgery than the other patients. Moreover, the time to occurrence of lymphopenia or neutropenia was significantly longer in the former than the latter, suggesting that patients with lower neutrophil and lymphocyte counts preoperatively had better postoperative immune function than the other patients.

While IgE molecules are essential for these reactions, the function of IgG in allergic reactions remains unknown. The IgG immune response is essential for the allergic reaction, even when IgE is not present. Allergic reactions would not likely occur if IgG synthesis were completely suppressed.

Here, we investigated the effect of bovine interleukin-4 (bIL-4) on the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and expression of adhesion molecule CD44 and CD62L in PBLC derived from bovine tuberculosis (bTB) cows. BALB/c mice were divided into control and infection groups (10 each group). In the control group, no Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) was added, but in the infection group, M. bovis H153 was inoculated under intraperitoneal conditions. After 8, 16, and 24 weeks, blood was collected from the tail vein, and PBMC was isolated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in the serum of bTB mice after 24 weeks of inoculation showed a significant difference. PBLC from bTB mice after 24 weeks of inoculation produced significantly more IL-8 and significantly lower frequencies of CD44 + CD4 + CD7 + , CD44 + CD4 + CD7 \u2212 , CD62L + CD4 + CD7 + , and CD62L + CD4 + CD7 \u2212 lymphocytes than bactin or PBS groups.

HPV infections have been shown to increase HSPs expression and stabilize several oncogenic proteins; however, the direct effects of HPV E6 oncoproteins on HSF1\u2010regulated HSPs are not well understood yet. Here we investigated the effects of HPV\u201018 E6 on HSF1 activation and cell stress survival by modulating the transcription of HSPs. We stably transduced Hela and SiHa cells with a lentiviral vector expressing the E6 protein. The E6 oncogene significantly affected the expression of HSF1 proteins and their upstream\u2010activated factors, including HSF\u20101, HEAT SHOCK FACTOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2A (HSF2A) and 2B (HSF2B). In addition, overexpression of E6 oncoprotein was shown to promote the survival and invasion of malignant cervical cancer cells under heat shock and hypoxic stress. The E6 oncoprotein also upregulated Hsp70, Hsp90\u03b1 and Hsp90\u03b2 at mRNA and protein levels in HeLa and SiHa cells, providing evidence of E6\u2010mediated induction of cellular heat shock response. E6 inhibition decreases HSF1 expression, resulting in decreased cell invasion in vitro, as well as inhibition of tumor formation and invasion in a cervical cancer mouse model. Finally, our study showed that HSF1 expression correlated with that of its downstream target HSP70 in cervical tumors. Our work reveals a new mechanism between HPV oncoproteins and HSF1, providing clues to potential therapeutic targets to combat HPV\u2010related diseases.<EOD> Fatigue during spaceflight, part II: microgravitational effects on human performance.\nThe purpose of this second report of the Space Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI",

It is well documented that an angiogenic potential may be a biologically important difference of the seminal plasma (SP) between normospermic (NS) and oligospermic (OS) men. Our knowledge of the complex mechanisms regulating spermatogenesis and the reproductive processes is limited. Angiogenesis occurs not only in tissues of the female reproductive tract, but also in those of the male reproductive system (2). Infertility can be caused by poor spermatogenesis, abnormal sperm function, aberrant interaction between spermatozoa and oocytes, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine factor, uterine fibroids, and pelvic congestion syndrome (PGS). PGS is classified into 4 types according to the etiology (myomas, varicoceles, adenomyosis, lymphocoele). PGS contributes to male fertility problems, such as erectile dysfunction, chronic prostatitis, varicocelectomy, sperm retrieval, and the decreased fertilization rates, as well as increases the miscarriage rate. Recent studies have shown that the expression of some vascular growth factors and their receptors in the testicular vein of infertile men is associated with lower sperm counts, abnormal sperm morphologies, and increased concentrations of FSH, and the hormonal profile of the patients can be improved by varicolectomy (3). Moreover, varicoele is the most frequent pathologic condition associated with male infertility (4). The main symptoms are bilateral, but the left testicular vein is more affected by venous reflux than the right one. Although a considerable portion of infertile men with varicocele and unexplained infertility exhibit impaired spermatogenesis and defects in sperm maturation and motility, little is known about the molecular mechanisms linking",

Maastricht\nT he prevalence of overweight children in the Netherlands is higher than that reported elsewhere in Western Europe. It is unclear what factors may influence or explain this seemingly paradoxical observation. However, this trend in recent years appears to correspond with the increased immigration to the Netherlands, as demonstrated by Statistics Netherlands .\nAn article in this journal and in The Lancet points to the potential influence of the increased consumption of high-caloric and energy-dense types of foods in addition to the decreased level of physical activity being undertaken by children. 1,2 To test this hypothesis, we determined the prevalence of overweight and obesity among two subpopulations of the Dutch population -Dutch-speaking children and children from immigrants, defined by the parents' country of birth.\nThis analysis was based on data collected as part of the study \"Preventing overweight in preschool children: a randomized controlled trial,\" ongoing at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. In the study, 690 4-year-old children living in the region of Amsterdam, who visited the outpatient division of the academic department of pediatrics from September 2004 to October 2006, were randomly assigned to intervention groups focused on prevention of overweight. Parents were interviewed after the routine visit about whether the child was of Dutch origin or a child of immigrants.\nThe children came for the initial visit at age 4 with no recent symptoms or conditions, and only a minority (127 [or 18%]) had been seen by a physician in a preceding year. Weight and height measurements were then taken, following which parents completed a questionnaire. Children were classified into three groups depending on the body mass index (i.e., weight in kilograms divided by the square of body height in metres). The three groups were normal (between the 10th and 85th centiles), overweight/obese (\u2265 85th centile) and underweight (< 10th centile).\nAnthropometric measurements of weight and height were recorded to the",

The family of type-B response regulators (RRs) is encoded by one gene class of the family of G-protein signaling pathways in Arabidopsis. Despite a high degree of similarity among RR proteins, they play distinct regulatory roles and have different subcellular localizations. Here, we describe the expression and function of RR4 (GmRR4), a type-B RR gene from soybean. RR4 is constitutively expressed in various plant organs, including roots and stems upon abiotic stress conditions; its mRNA steadily accumulates in a wide range of plant tissues and also in leaves after dehydration. Transgenic Soybean overexpressing gmRR4 has enhanced root biomass and aphid resistance, and was sensitive to the salt stress. RR4 was targeted to the nucleus under nonstress conditions, which was altered to enrich in the cytoplasm under abiotic stress conditions. This change is consistent with the finding that RR4 functions in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus. These observations indicate that RR4 participates in various abiotic stress responses including biotic stress and provides new insights about RR4 and G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in plants.<EOD> A comparative study of the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine and thiamazole using different rat models.\nThis study was designed to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine with that of thiamazole in rat adjuvant arthritis, carrageenin edema, dextran edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation models.

This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of trauma center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high mortality is attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly, cardiac disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although beta-blockade has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for myocardial infarction after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential underlying cardiac disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine administration of beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.\nThis study is a",

Distraction and osteotomy were performed over either the medial or the lateral tibia. The patients were assessed by the modified Maryland Foot Score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ankles were assessed by the Orthopaedic Research Institute Ankle Score. The average patient age at the time of the procedure was thirty-seven years, and the average follow-up period was four years. The average increase in the medial clear space was 5.3 mm, from 3.5 mm to 8.8 mm; the average increase in the lateral clear space was 6.3 mm, from 4.9 mm to 11.2 mm. No patients developed avascular necrosis or had loss of bone from the distraction zone, which was not covered by articular cartilage. All except one patient had a good result. The average preoperative score of forty-three points increased to seventy-nine points; in some patients the final score improved above the average points received by a normal foot in a healthy individual (ninety-two points).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnkle distraction arthroplasty is a useful technique for restoring the articular surface on the talar dome in osteochondral defects, and allows an effective reduction of congruency in the sagittal and mortise views of the ankle.<EOD> High-resolution 3D surface topography reconstruction using confocal laser scanning microscopy and computational geometry.\nA reconstruction method for rebuilding a three dimensional surface topography image from two-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) data is proposed for micro-",

POCS monolayer can be used as the template to synthesize mesoporous titania because of its hierarchical nano- and microstructure. The synthesis is very simple, reliable, and cost-effective, and titania can be uniformly grown on fabrics without any treatment, which is very beneficial to the applications of fabrics. The effects of pH value, the dosage of POCS, and titania on the morphologies, pore structure, properties, and photocatalytic activities of the film were investigated. The characterization results show that the hierarchical mesostructured titania film uniformly coats the fabrics, with an extremely large surface area of 121.06 m2 g(-1) and pore volume of 0.3600 cm3 g(-1). The titania film exhibits excellent dye adsorption for colorants (MB and RhB), and the adsorption capacity of 20 min is 1.67 mg g(-1) for RhB and 1.11 mg g(-1) for MB dye. It also exhibits good photocatalytic activity for the inactivation of E. coli (at least 80% in 30 min).<EOD> Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction\n\nBackground: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decrease in acute healthcare utilization has been reported for both cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases.

        "output": "<EOD> Association of Sensate Dural Layers With Pterygopalatine Artery: An Anatomical Observation\nBackgroundThe pterygopalatine artery (PPA) is vital for preservation of the blood supply of the brain. The dura mater (DM) of the midbrain is intimately connected to the PPA and therefore is exposed to its high risk of occlusion. These 2 structures can be directly connected during skull base approaches in cases of extensive dural retraction. We aimed to investigate the possibility of developing an alternative route for the preservation of the blood supply of the brain in such cases. MethodsWe dissected 15 formalin-fixed specimens of the pterygopalatine region by using the modified Kerkhoff technique to identify the DM. The relationships between the dural folds and the PPA were analyzed. ResultsWe obtained 2 new findings in these specimens. First, the PPA was found in the DM in 10 (67%) specimens. Most of these PPAs entered through the roof of the infratemporal fossa through the greater petrosal nerve, or through an intradural route, in the midbrain region. The DM contained several sensate folds. Some sensate DM was connected with the PPA, and some PPAs were located behind the DM. Some of these PPAs passed through the sensate DM, which had sensation on the PPA. ConclusionsWe reported a surgically significant and easily recognizable variation of the PPA located in or behind the DM in the midbrain region and communicating with the PPA. This variation may help preservation of the blood supply to the brain in cases of surgical insult to the DM.<EOD> Invasive Hemophilus influenzae infections in adults.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation is a potent initiator of NE differentiation and a prognostic marker of disease progression. Here, we show that AhR activation induces NE differentiation in the androgen-independent PC cell line DU145 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that AhR activation reduces androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity upon androgen treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that the NE phenotype is enhanced in patient-derived tumors with a reduced AR expression compared to AR-positive tumors upon AhR activation. Thus, our results show that the integration of external and intrinsic information, such as androgens and proliferative signals, regulates AR expression and is essential to initiate NE differentiation. We propose that AhR activation in patients with PC who have reduced AR expression could be an efficient therapeutic strategy to reduce growth of NE tumor cells and, consequently, reduce proliferation and tumor burden.<EOD> Effective drug intervention for patients with alcoholism and antisocial disorder.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe authors examined whether the benefits of acamprosate (a drug that has produced encouraging results in trials of patients with alcoholics who continue to abuse alcohol) can be extended to patients with alcoholism who also have antisocial or borderline personality disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors treated an open sample of 39 alcoholic patients with comorbid antisocial disorder with daily doses of up to 600 mg of acamprosate.

Patients in the nonoperative group will be place in a sling for two weeks and then allowed to mobilise under supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. For those patients in the operative group, tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their supervising consultant.

In this study, the effects of addition of EGF or TGF-\u03b1 to chemically-defined medium were investigated. As a result, the effect of adding TGF-\u03b1 to the medium in the form of BM-derived osteoblasts (BMBOs) was shown to be more pronounced than that of adding EGF. When compared with the control, addition of 20 ng/mL TGF-\u03b1 to a BMBO-conditioned medium resulted in a 39% increase in the progenitor cell number after 24 hours. When grown in the media supplemented by 20 ng/mL EGF, the cell number showed no significant increase compared to that in the control (P < .05). In conclusion, TGF-\u03b1 is better than EGF in the stimulation of porcine BM progenitor cells, and the present study provides evidence that TGF-\u03b1 might be used to supplement chemically-defined medium in vitro.<EOD> The effect of a pharmacist intervention on healthcare costs in asthma at primary care level.\nAIM\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of the clinical pharmacist's intervention on costs associated with asthma treated at primary care level.\n\n\nDESIGN OF THE STUDY\nThe case-control design was used.\n\n\nMETHOD\nPatients were recruited from 14 primary care clinics.

The uptake of ACS from the lung and the cerebral uptake of carbon dioxide were measured directly, as were blood flow and arteriovenous differences for blood-borne ACA in the brain (arterial minus venous ACA concentrations). Following intake of ACS, the cerebral uptake of carbon dioxide declined. While pentobarbitone alone had little influence on the intake of ACS from the lung, the cerebral ACA accumulation and the cerebral uptake of ACS depended on the type of anaesthetic. The use of sevoflurane, isoflurane, halothane and methoxyflurane decreased the uptakes of ACS from the lung and carbon dioxide, and increased the intracarotid-intracerebral (i.c.-i.c.) difference. These differences increased, however, in the presence of diethyl ether. Enflurane and halothane decreased the cerebral ACA accumulation, but enflurane increased the cerebral blood flow.

Six different sugars were used, and the tolerance curves were similar in respect of time to peak rise and total amount of carbohydrate being absorbed but they differed greatly in the amount of carbohydrate absorbed. There was a great degree of overlapping between glucose and the other sugars, a phenomenon shown also for glucose and lactose and to a lesser extent for glucose and galactose but not for glucose and maltose. This overlap was considered to be due partly to the small amount of carbohydrate given and partly to the relatively unreleased glucose being available to the rest of the animal (as it is in the dog). A series of tests, in which either glucose or maltose was given, showed a high incidence (over 80",

The reasons for designating the parasitic nematodes as biological invasives are the ability to rapidly invade new habitats, adapt quickly to new hosts, and spread very quickly, often at a global scale.\nDespite being recognized as invasive species, the term 'invasive nematodes' mainly refers to free-living nematodes [bib_ref]  A review of nematodes that have been reported mainly in wildlife, with..., Cutmore [/bib_ref] .

The AHC approach consists of data analysis by multivariate statistical methods in three steps, using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms. Since AHC does not use any statistical method explicitly designed to identify haplotypes, we have used the software to cluster the DNA microarray samples and the subsequent application of several algorithms designed to detect haplotypes. Since each of these haplotype detection programs uses a different approach to identify haplotypes we can use this method to compare the approaches of the different softwares. The results show that in cases where all samples belong to one group, the use of AHC with the PCA algorithm for the analysis gives better results in the discrimination of haplotypes than the combination of the different haplotype detection softwares.<EOD> Reconstruction of the mandible with interpositional osteonecrosis graft associated with maxillary and mandibular osteosynthesis and titanium plates.

There are many types of glycosylation disorder classifications that have been proposed, many of them involving overlapping groups of symptoms and diagnoses. CDGs can be classified by glycan type; glycoenzymatic pathway; type of protein to which the carbohydrate chains will bind, resulting in 13 different CDGs; CDG families by shared features of certain mutations; or a combination of the last two. Case Presentation:A 16-month-old female presented with a history of multiple admissions from recurrent episodes of vomiting and respiratory distress. The patient had numerous diagnoses, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, apnea of prematurity, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delay. The medical history was also complicated by chronic seizures, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections requiring multiple rounds of antibiotics. The patient had a number of other systemic complications, including pustular scars on the trunk, a hypotonic upper extremity, strabismus, and a delayed speech pattern. A genetic mutation in UDP-Glucose Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase(UGGT) was discovered. Conclusion: This case report indicates that CDG with a genetic mutation in SLC35A2 may cause symptoms including developmental delay, recurrent severe vomiting, and chronic lung disease.\nCongenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of genetic defects that present with a wide range of possible symptoms and diagnoses. CDGs have been reported as causing developmental delays, psychiatric disorders, seizures, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, failure to thrive, visual problems, renal and liver disease, autoimmune disorders, and respiratory issues such as pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.CDGs",

In addition to the role of the central nervous system, the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of salt and water homeostasis, renin secretion and vascular tone. The central nervous system can excite the sympathetic outflow to the adrenal medulla (AM), where catecholamines are synthesized and stored. On the other side, there is also an ascending sympathetic influence on the AM, leading to the enhanced catecholamine release. The AM is the principal source of circulating catecholamines, noradrenaline (NA) being the major NA stored and secreted from this organ. Although previous studies demonstrate that NA itself exhibits hypotensive effects, there are also reports showing that the AM is a site of amplified blood pressure response during AH. Recent studies have shown that sympathetic activity targeted to the AM is enhanced in patients with essential AH as well as in AH associated with renovascular atherosclerosis (RMAH) and pheochromocytoma. Thus, one might suggest that the AM plays a role in the pathophysiology of AH.\n\n# Introduction\nThe prevalence of arterial hypertension (AH) as a global public health issue has been estimated to be about 1.13 billion persons, which accounts for around a third of the global burden of disease.

To do this, use backtrack command, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform \\\n      [pwd] \\\n      clinical_trial/note.txt\\\n      patients/data/[patient_id].txt\\\n      -type \"S\" -o patients`. Next, you can use the command to compare the text in the first column of the text file and first two sentences in the patient note, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform [pwd] -type \"F\" -o patients `. Or, you can use the command to find the number of characters in the first column, e.g.,\n`python src/evaluate.py backtrack -type \"W\" -o patients`. The command will generate a new file named `patients.txt`. The column \"W(total_word_count)\" contains the number of words in each sentence as follows: `15`. You can find which two sentences are compared by looking at the first line of patients.txt, `Trial-level eligibility: 0). You can view the entire output, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform [pwd] -type \"F\" -o patients`.

Some overlap of disease presentation is probably explained by a high proportion of coinfected individuals with chronic hepatitis or advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis related to HCV infection. Others may be due to the fact that HCV may alter aspects of immune status, and HIV replication. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the potential neurotoxicity induced by antiretroviral drugs, a risk that has only recently been considered, as data on the role of HIV protease inhibitor agents, for example, in neurotoxicity are currently scarce.<EOD> .\nThe article is based on the experience with a single-centre surgical treatment of 210 patients who were operated on for pericarditis complicated by constrictive changes in the pericardial cavity.

Methods The classification criteria and categories defined by a clinical decision support system applied on vascular interventions were classified into eight categories: Medical Prescription, Antibiotic Prescription, Cardiac Arrhythmia, Electrolyte Disorder, Renal Insufficiency, Neurological Disorder, Patient's Characteristics, and Drug Interaction. Each category was subdivided into subcategories. A standardized medical taxonomy was used as the structure to build the classification hierarchy. Results The hierarchy has a total of thirty-three sub-categories. It enables the clinical decision support system to create notifications, based on information extracted from clinical patient records. The application can then issue alerts, warnings, or reminders to a health care provider, or it may require intervention of a health services management team. Conclusion A classification system with defined criteria was designed, that enabled the generation of clinical decision support notifications. The system was tested for the alert generation of a clinical decision support system applied on vascular interventions and has shown to work efficiently.Key PointsThis paper presents a structured methodology, using a medical taxonomy for clinical decision support criteria classification, applied to vascular interventions.The proposed methodology has enabled to create a hierarchy structure with clear definitions to classify clinical decision support criteria.\n\n# Introduction\nElectronic health records (EHR) were introduced to increase the efficiency of health care delivery, as EHR can be retrieved from virtually anywhere, and patients' information is available instantly to different care providers.

We used the following assessment instruments: Barthel test, mini-mental state examination, and the dementia scale of dementias questionnaire (SDDQ). We collected socio-demographic data on the patients and caregivers, and we evaluated the quality of life of the patient (measured with the SDDQ), caregivers, and the type of dementia.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND PROCEDURES\nWe applied the quality of life questionnaire to the patients and to the patient's family caregiver (SDDQ). We collected all necessary demographic data and assessed the patients with the following tests: mini-mental state examination and Barthel index. These data were compared with and without pharmacological therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe type of dementia of the patients was most frequently vascular dementias (26%) and frontotemporal dementias (24%). The mean Barthel score was 82+/-25 and the mean mini-mental state examination score was 12+/-5.3, which implies that the patients had a low degree of dependence and a non-cognitive altered state of consciousness.

Recent findings In the last year, several risk factors were identified as associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. These include: nulliparous and advanced maternal age, and pregestational diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, chronic kidney disease, anaemia, and malaria. In the context of nutrition related risk factors, vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency with reduced iron status are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (PTB). The potential importance of maternal immunization was recognized, and recent data showed the effects of maternal influenza vaccination on PTB and low birth weight (LBW) in Africa. In addition, new screening tests to detect high and low LBW at risk and prevent PTB were suggested. Summary The identification of risk factors has a crucial role in the assessment and management of pregnant women and their offspring, and in preventing adverse outcomes. Health care should be delivered in accordance with each woman's individual needs, which should be reflected in routine maternal and perinatal surveillance programs, using a risk stratification approach. New strategies for treatment and prevention of complications are needed because risk factors associated with malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.<EOD> The relationship between age, sex, and renal stone disease.

Activation of CD8+ T cells is a complex process influenced by diverse cytokines and chemokines. In the current study we assess the role of NK and NKT cells in this process. The authors demonstrate that CpG, a CpG\u2010containing immunostimulatory DNA oligonucleotide, is capable of triggering significant activation of CD8+ T cells in the absence of both NK and NKT cells.

        "output": "<EOD> Nucleic Acids Research\n\nIn this paper we present four new methods for sequencing nucleotide sequences using restriction fragments of DNA or synthetic oligomers containing a single central base; these methods are based on primer extension using a radioactive 18-mer (0.2 pmol) or enzymatic incorporation of dideoxy termination products (12 pmol), and on thermal denaturation of a specific primer in the presence of denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in comparison with those of the original dideoxy termination method of Maxam and Gilbert.\n\n# Introduction\nThe term \"primed sequencing\" was introduced in 1976 for DNA sequencing methods involving the hybridization of a short DNA fragment containing a primer (primed region) to a longer nucleic acid fragment, which is then elongated, releasing the primed region for subsequent hybridization with a radioactive labeled primer. After a great variety of protocols has been established for DNA sequencing, we have reconsidered the application of the primer extension method to dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing (1) and found two important new advantages over the earlier method (2) of sequence analysis. First, the new method, using a specific primer (3) is easier to use in a routine sequencing laboratory than the dideoxy method involving the selection of a random primer. Second, the new sequencing procedure yields reliable and reproducible results as well as the original one.\nThere are two advantages of specific primers for sequencing. First, they lead to high fidelity in DNA sequencing, yielding a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 40:1 (4), which greatly facilitates manual signal identification at low-background densities, such as are easily achieved without problems with the synthetic substrate . Second, the use of a specific primer simplifies the purification of radiolabeled primed fragments in dideoxy sequencing. The specific primer is used to remove the end-labeled restriction fragment by annealing and extension followed by size-fractionation on the gel. Using the specific primer, one can distinguish the two overlapping 32P-labeled fragments in the sequencing reaction as easily as at least a",

Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus, infecting, annually, over 70 million people in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. There is an urgent need for novel chemical control strategies against this mosquito. We have shown that one promising candidate for such a novel control is an experimental triazolide-class juvenile hormone mimics, IKM72. Using a series of bioassays (LC50, LC90, WHO standardization assay) we have demonstrated, for the first time, that IKM72 exhibits high adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. Further, through a histological study via scanning electron microscope, we have explored the mechanism of IKM72 action. IKM72 induces malformation and collapse of adult mosquito ovaries. We found that exposure of Ae. aegypti to IKM72 at LC50 concentration for 24\u2009h also induces apoptosis through activation of caspase 3 protein and de",

Findings\n\n[NAME]\n\nI feel the following findings/differences are relevant.\n\nFindings/Differences\n\n### Diagnosis/Eligibility\n\nThe patient notes, i.e., the first 3 paragraphs as shown in [INST#.1]:\nA 28-year-old female with neck and shoulder pain and left hand and arm paresthesias three weeks after returning from a trip to California where she attended a stray animal recovery campaign. Her physical exam was unremarkable except for slight tremors and almost imperceptible spasticity. She was prescribed NSAIDS and a topical muscle relaxant. She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficultly swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n\nHere is the clinical trial:\nTitle: Octanol to Treat Essential Tremor\n\nSummary: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 1-octanol, a substance similar to alcohol but less intoxicating, for treating essential tremor. Essential tremor is an involuntary shaking, usually of the hands, for which there is no satisfactory treatment. It affects about 1.4 percent of the general U.S. population, with the figure climbing to nearly 4 percent among people over 40. Results of two previous NIH studies have shown 1-octanol to be promising as a potential new treatment. This study will test the effectiveness of 1-octanol on essential tremor at doses lower than those given previously.\n\nPatients 21 years old and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this study. Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two treatment periods of 1 week each, with a 1-week break at home between treatments. Before beginning treatment, participants undergo a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition, tremors are measured using accelerometry, a procedure in which a small device, mounted on a piece of cardboard, is taped to the patient's hand for about 30",

People with tobacco use disorders have high stress levels and increased cravings for nicotine during stressful periods in their lives.~Smokers in smoke-free hospital settings, like those admitted to the hospital with a recent tobacco-related illness, are likely to be motivated to stop using tobacco products. Given this setting, nicotine deprivation can be used to induce unpleasant smoking cessation",

The four DONT derivatives were docked to a common template comprised of the N-terminal region of the human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). A comparison of binding affinities of CP178, EA150, DA150 and TE150 for DONT in an aqueous environment at several temperatures is presented. This comparison is based upon the Gibbs free energy difference between DONT in water and DONT in the AACl template (GDD). In a previous experimental paper, we proposed that the hydrophobic effects at the interface of the two recognition moieties and the amino acids were the main contributors to the interaction between HCA II and DONT. In this theoretical study, the interaction between the recognition moiety and the amino acids are attributed to the stabilization of the binding of DONT to the template and the interaction between the two recognition moiety. In addition, the interaction between the AACl templates and DONT is shown to depend upon the size of the template cavity, as well as its hydrophobicity. It is predicted that a template with a large cavity size, such as TE150, would interact more weakly with DONT as compared to a template with a cavity size closer to the HCA II size, such as EA150. These results are in agreement with experimental study which shows that the amino acids functionalized with a large-sized cleft are better able to selectively bind the DONT derivatives than the templates functionalized with small-sized clefts.<EOD> Diversity and distribution",

A theoretical model based on the Maxwell and Gibbs equations is proposed in order to describe the osmotic pressure jump. The maximum shrinking velocity is determined quantitatively with a model that involves the diffusion coefficients corresponding to the solvent particles, the polymer particles and the colloidal microgels. The effect of changes in the particle concentration and the particle radius on the shrinking velocity is also studied. When a particle concentration gradient is applied, a particle concentration concentration gradient remains within the medium, which results in a pressure change over the inner particles. The maximum shrinking velocity of the particles is not affected by the particle concentration gradient. We conclude that the shrinking velocity of the colloidal microgels is insensitive to the application of a concentration gradient on the inner particles, given that the pressure variation induced over the microgel particles is not much higher than the pressure variation induced by the osmotic pressure jump. Finally, results concerning the drying of the colloidal microgel particles are presented. It is found that the diffusion through the cross-section of the colloidal microgel is the rate determining step. This diffusion is not hindered by the shrinking of the collo",

Members of the family Rhabdoviridae can be classified into at least four genera, all of which possess a bullet-shaped virion structure. We have investigated the intracellular and extracellular stages of the rhabdovirus LpCN1 by ultrastructural immunocytochemical analysis of its propagation and budding in the vector Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Lepidoptera) midgut.Methods: Cryostat-embedded insect midgut tissue was analyzed by transmission and immunoelectron microscopy. Antisera were raised to the glycoproteins of the virus and to the C. fumiferana midgut.Results: All major viral structural proteins of LpCN1 were expressed in the midgut epithelial cells with the exception of G1. Immunocytochemical staining revealed the presence of viral proteins in vesicles and small membrane-bound saccules within the epithelial cells. These structures did not stain with the anti-membrane midgut antisera. The extracellular stages of viral particle assembly were found as single viral particles, extracellular capsid-containing compartments, and free viral capsids. Although the virus particles had no other membrane envelope than the capsid membrane, viral particles were found attached to the microvilli of infected enterocytes.Conclusions:It is shown for the first time in an E-type rhabdovirus that the virus spreads in the vector host by entering the midgut. The virus forms compartments encompassing the viral capsids within the host cell cytoplasm, which may subsequently be released as free virions into the intestinal content.\n\n# Background\nRhabdoviruses of insects are highly host-specific and replicate only in a limited number of host taxa within the same order, mainly insects [bib_ref]  The nucleoprotein",

For example, in the above case, instead of looking to check for the existence of the word \"stray\", you will be looking for the existence of at least one word that is in the set and returns a true or false, indicating if the patient meets the requirement or not.\n- Since the set contains words indicating exclusion criteria, we will write if in the if statement\n\t- in place of the condition, \"if condition then true\",\n\t- in if else else in place of \" else if (else if condition) then true\",\n\t- in while in place of \"while condition\", and\n\t- in do else while in place of \"do while condition\".\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n## Coding Approach\n- The first thing that you are going to implement is the Trial-level eligibility.

The complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) prevent undesired activation of complement. They include factor H, C4b-binding protein (C4bp), CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59. To investigate the structural and functional homologies among these molecules, we have characterized full-length human or human/mouse chimeric C4bp genes, which lacked the major erythrocyte receptor target domains. A transgenic mouse model was established and the physiology of the human CRPs studied. We established that although the transgene was functional in mice, human factor H and CD35 were unable to rescue the phenotype of complement C3-deficient or factor B-deficient mice, whereas murine C4bp was functional. By contrast, a human C4bp transgene rescued the phenotype of the deficient animal, whereas murine C4bp was poorly functional. We also demonstrated that the transgene encodes a soluble protein capable of binding C4b. Transgenic animals were found to have significantly higher plasma levels of factor B in comparison to nontransgenic littermates, reflecting a role for C4bp regulation in the metabolism of the alternative pathway of complement and demonstrating compensation in plasma C4BP levels as a result of the overexpression of the transgene. The study provides strong evidence for the conservation of regulatory strategies in the human and murine complement systems.<EOD> Association of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Status With HPV Genotypes Detected From Genital Warts.\nImportance\nGenital warts (GWs) are linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and HPV vaccination may reduce the risk for GWs.",

When lead-based paints were used all over the world and most of the population had been occupationally and environmentally exposed to lead, chronic health effects of lead were clearly established [bib_ref]  Health Effects of Lead (Pb2+): New Developments, Goyer [/bib_ref] .

Due to the ban of lead-based paint and the implementation of legislation to protect these workers, chronic exposure is now limited.

A subset of 16,691 individuals with complete information on 23 variables was used to develop and test the new algorithm. A test for the difference in sensitivity was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of subjects identified by the algorithm was 92.4% (71.5-100%), compared with 11.9% (10.8-12.9%) achieved by the previously reported algorithm.

This study explores the use of a commercially available interference free (IF) sweat sensor to determine sweat glucose concentrations (SC) at rest and during exercise. Methods: 12 subjects underwent steady state conditions and 1-hour exercise at 67%, 82%, and 97% of individual anaerobic threshold (AT) during which SC, blood glucose (BG), and blood lactate (BLa) were periodically determined. Measurements were made over clean dry skin using an electrochemical sensor (AccuCheck 357706; AccuCheck, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). IF and non-IF electrochemistry were used for SC measurements. In addition, all samples were analysed using a standardized biosensor and enzyme methods (YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose and Lactate Analyser; YSI, Yellow Springs, USA). Results: SC correlated well with IF SC (r = 0.97) and with BG (r = 0.93). Measurements of BG and SC in the resting state (r = 0.94, n = 94) and in hyperglycaemia (r = 0.94, n = 19) produced similar results, although there was large variation between subjects. Compared with BG, SC was highly concordant over clean skin and all AT intensities (r 2 = 0.72\u20130.91) in the exercise state. SC changes with high intensity",

However, RT can compromise the DNA of both healthy and tumour cells. This exacerbation of DNA damage can trigger cell death in tumour cells through the mechanisms of apoptosis or necrosis. In contrast, in healthy and normal cells, this may manifest itself as reduced cell proliferation and, consequently, contribute to the inhibition of tumour growth (and, therefore, to an improved overall outcome). Low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) is defined as a regimen of radiation therapy that delivers less than 2 Gy divided over several treatment days. The effect of LD-RT on the tumour microenvironment is mediated through complex, non-targeted and nonspecific mechanisms. These have the potential to modify the activity of the immune system against tumours; in other words, LD-RT may increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy (which in recent years has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for cancer treatment). The first aim of this study was to evaluate, using a rodent model of radiation therapy, the effects of low doses of radiation on tumour growth and tumour infiltration by immune (CD4+ and CD8+) and non-immune (CD206+, CD31+) cells, as compared with conventional (high-dose, c-RT). The second purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of low radiation on the immune and non-immune cells of healthy organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen and kidney.

To date, the concept of reserve has not been well understood by clinicians, possibly because it has not been included in the widely used cognitive staging models of cognitive decline. The aims of this study are to develop a model that combines reserve, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and to test the predictive validity of such a model in a cohort of health check-up examinees. Methods: Two models of reserve combining MCI and dementia were designed. First, reserve was conceptualized as the interaction between the individual and the environment. Second, the accumulation of vascular lesions with the individual's ability to compensate for losses, or its \u2018neural capital\u2019, were considered. A logistic regression analysis was performed in a sample of 1,073 health check-up examinees. Results: The multivariate adjusted logistic regression models showed the model of \u2018reserve\u2019 composed of the interaction of reserve and MCI (orange model) to have higher adjusted odds ratios (ORs; 95% CI) in the discrimination of non-cases, including healthy subjects, from cases with mild neurological disorders than the model of \u2018reserve\u2019 composed of the accumulation of vascular lesions with the individual's ability to compensate for losses (red model). The inclusion of cognitive reserve in the cognitive staging models yielded increased validity in the prediction of cognitive staging. Conclusions: The orange model of reserve may improve the prediction of a more rapid onset of dementia.",

        "output": "<EOD> A review: Clinical and metabolic features of hyperinsulinemia in the normal state.\nHyperinsulinemic normal man has been reported not infrequently in the past several years. The prevalence of this abnormality among normals is estimated to be from 1 to 13 percent. All reported patients have had a low insulin response to oral glucose intolerance tests, a normal or elevated insulin response to i.v. glucose injection, and normal or elevated fasting levels of insulin. Hyperinsulinemic normals appear to have more clinical (obesity) abnormalities than nonhyperinsulinemic normals. Hyperinsulinemia, once induced in normals, was found to persist after 4 to 6 days if fasting was avoided. Metabolic studies done on patients with persistently normal insulin levels and patients with hyperinsulinemia have led to the conclusion that: (1) pancreatic \u03b2 cells respond to fasting and glucose loading with a greater insulin secretion than normal; (2) patients with hyperinsulinemia have greater insulin response to all degrees of glucose stimulation; (3) fasting hyperinsulinemics have lower hepatic glucose reutilization and a lower capacity for gluconeogenesis, although rates of exogenous glucose disappearance are normal; (4) the low insulin response of hyperinsulinemics to OGTT is not due to saturation of insulin receptors by physiologic levels of insulin circulating during the test, but appears to be due to an intrinsic insulin defect; (5) patients with hyperinsulinism have lower glucose disappearance rates at a glucose load of 500 mg/kg body wt, although the rate of increase of blood glucose with the load is similar to that of nonhyperinsulinemics; (6) hyperinsulinemia appears to be familial, and (7) hyperinsulinemia might be explained by genetic or environmental factors (possibly an increased adrenergic tone), by overactive \u03b2 cells, or by a low threshold for insulin secretion",

        "output": "<EOD> Prostate-specific antigen and breast cancer.\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA), a 33-kD serine enzyme, has a major role in the physiologic function of the prostate gland.1 The enzyme's primary function is the formation of choline at the sn \u20133 position of membrane phospholipids in sperm,2 and the enzyme is secreted into seminal fluid but not into serum.3 A second physiologic function of PSA is associated with an inactive form of the metalloenzyme, matrix metalloproteinase-2 .4\n\nProstate-specific antigen was originally identified as a component of semen, where it was found at relatively high concentrations; the serum level is lower. With prostate cancer, elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels occur, but there is considerable overlap with prostate-specific antigen serum activity in men who have benign prostatic disease or who are healthy. Apart from the prostate and sperm, there is no specific tissue that exhibits activity of this enzyme.1 Prostate-specific antigen serum activity correlates reasonably well with prostate size and severity of prostate cancer.1\n\n### PROSTATE CANCER\n\nElevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels with and without prostate cancer occur in several extratesticular abnormal conditions. These include seminal vesicle hypertrophy or atrophy (with elevations up to about 15 to 20 \u03bcg per liter) and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Other conditions, although not associated with prostate cancer, also lead to elevations in serum prostate-specific antigen. These include benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, prostate nodules, and the presence of carcinoma in situ of the prostate. Finally, because of the ubiquitous presence of prostate cells in the male body and the inability of prostate to divide without entering a prelethal state, serum prostate-specific antigen levels increase with age. The presence of prostate-specific antigen in malignant pleural, ascitic, and pericardial fluids has also been reported .\n\n\n\n :",
