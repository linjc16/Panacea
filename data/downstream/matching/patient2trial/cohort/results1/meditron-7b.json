Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Invasive Haemophilus influenzae Infection in Adults\n\nBackground. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is primarily transmitted via contaminated water and is rarely acquired through person-to-person transmission. During 2016, a large outbreak of cholera was identified in a refugee camp in northern Zambia. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and outcomes of V. cholerae infection in this cohort.Methods. Surveillance of cholera cases was conducted from December 2016 through June 2017. A standard case definition of acute watery or rice-water diarrhea was used for case identification, along with a rectal swab for V. cholerae Ogawa O1 ELISA testing. Clinical and demographic data and information concerning water, sanitation, and crowding were collected in a detailed questionnaire while the patient received inpatient care.Results. Among 787 suspected cholera cases identified, 1028 rectal swabs were collected. The number of cases confirmed by ELISA during the outbreak was 138 (17.7%, 95% CI: 14.9-20.7%), among them 63 (44.9%) were children < 15 years, 42 (30.4%) were infants < 5 years (P < 0.0001), and 68 (49.3%) were male. Cholera patients were more likely to have symptoms of vomiting and dehydration than non-cases (77.6% vs 53.2%, P < 0.0001; 57.2% vs 18.1%, P < 0.0001, respectively).

Two 7-mer peptides A2 and A3 were previously identified through synthesized overlapping peptides that were bound to purified HSP60 by using monoclonal antibody. The third epitope, A1, was deduced through synthesis of truncated peptides that were bound to purified HSP60 and overlapped with two other epitope (A2 and A3). To identify epitopes and compare T cell responses between two C57bl/6 mouse strains, a T cell cloning assay was established. Murine splenocytes from C57bl/6(H-2b) and B10.D2(H-2d) mice primed with HSP60 were stimulated with different overlapping peptides mixed with antigen-presenting cells (APC). After screening cell populations for reactivity to antigens, the most frequent pattern of reactivity was to HSP60 followed by a 7-mer peptide A3. We were able to isolate T cell clones recognizing both A1 and A3 peptides. Surprisingly, we also isolated six T cell clones specific for the HSP60 itself that do not react with any HSP60-derived peptides when tested in a direct T cell proliferation assay. This ability of T cells to recognize the HSP60 and its epitopes correlated with the production of cytokines induced by the HSP60.

This trial is being conducted in a cohort with a similar disease progression so that the clinical effects of the new drug may be assessed in the homogeneous population in an early phase. The new drug is administered to patients as three times at a 28-day interval. The drug is an alkylating agent and it may produce myelosuppression. Myelosuppression is a decrease in numbers of blood cells produced by bone marrow due to the adverse effects of a drug. \n \nThis trial is a phase III trial to test a combined treatment with antidepressants for patients with major depression who failed monotherapy of antidepressant. Treatment-resistant depression, in which patients fail multiple antidepressant treatments, is severe and it affects quality of life and social functioning. This trial is being conducted in a cohort with similar clinical courses and the efficacy of the combined treatment is being assessed by using response rate and remodeling rate of the patients. The combined treatment is administered sixteen times at a 28-day interval on average. Combined treatment consists of an antidepressant and an anxiolytic.\n \nThis is a phase IV trial comparing two antihistamines for patients with allergic rhinitis. The clinical effects between two antihistamines are being assessed by determining difference in score of nasal patency and nasal symptoms. This trial is being conducted once at the last date of allergy season. Antihistamines work by inhibiting H1 receptors and blocking the production of chemical mediators of the inflammation response, such as serotonin, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.

However, a role for the BAinduced altered flux of cellular energy metabolism in affecting cellular dysfunction is unknown. Using metabolomics, it has been reported that cytosolic pyruvate is consumed in mouse cholangiocytes via a maladaptive mode of energy metabolism to supply cytosolic acetyl-CoA for BA synthesis. However, whether the reduced pyruvate availability affects energy metabolism and/or hepatic functions is unclear. A reduction in the flux of one or more glycolytic intermediates, such as pyruvate, is expected to increase pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and result in cytosolic alanine production. Here we report that the levels of the BA hydroxylation products, CA/MCA/HCA are increased in the livers and bile of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and these correlate with increased levels of alanine in the bile of these patients. To mimic these observations in experimental models, in vivo bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice upregulated PDH and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) expression and inhibited the PDHE1 phosphorylation in the livers. Using an ex vivo liver perfusion system, we found that a shortterm perfusion of BDL livers with deoxyglucose (DAGA) reduced the accumulation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and attenuated the inhibition of PDHE1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, perfusion with BAM15, a metabolic probe known to increase acetyl-CoA utilization during ketogenesis, similarly decreased the inhibition of PDHE1 phosphorylation, cytosol",

However, serum PSA level is used as a prognostic biomarker in nonurologic conditions including cardiovascular system, kidney, liver, and respiratory diseases. Method: In this study, we investigated the serum PSA level in patients with painful diabetic retinopathy (DR) (nodal painful DR with and without retinal detachment) and compared with that of patients with nonpainful DR. Results: Our present findings showed increased serum PSA in patients with painful DR (60.09 \u00b1 2.8 ng/mL) compared to the serum PSA levels of the patients with nonpainful DR (45.55 \u00b1 3.7 ng/mL). There was a statistically significant difference in the serum PSA level between these two groups (p < 0.01). Similarly, we find increased serum PSA in the patients with nodal painful DR (1.06 \u00b1 0.05 ng/mL) compared to the patients with nonpainful DR (0.66 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL) (p < 0.01).

LncRNA XIST expression in gastric cancer tissues and the paired adjacent normal tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the relationship between XIST and miR-99a. Moreover, we performed transwell assay in SGC7901 to detect whether XIST could influence cell invasion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nXIST expression levels of gastric cancer tissues were higher than that of paired non-tumor tissue. XIST expression levels were higher in gastric cancer patients with lymph node metastases than those without lymph node metastases. Moreover, XIST expression levels were also high in gastric cancer patients with lymphovascular invasion. Finally, in gastric cancer patients, higher XIST expression levels had poor prognosis. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that XIST may regulate miR-99a. In addition, we found that knockdown of XIST decreases SGC7901 cell invasion, an effect that could be reversed by knockdown of miR-99a.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLncRNA XIST was highly expressed in gastric cancer. Furthermore, high XIST expression is associated with lymph node metastases and lymphovascular invasion. Besides, in gastric cancer, XIST could promote SGC7901 cell line invasion by targeting miR-99a in vitro.<EOD> Comparison of the HAQ questionnaire to objective tests of physical function: an analysis strategy\n\nIntroduction: The 20-item Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is in almost daily use as a measure of physical function",

Amygdala neurons are known to express both NMDA\u2010 and mGluR5\u2010mediated forms of long\u2010term depression (LTD), but the interaction between NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and mGluR5s is poorly understood. We report that NMDA\u2010mediated synaptic depression in the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) exhibits a biphasic time\u2010course and can be blocked by mGluR5 antagonists and a L\u2010type calcium channel blocker. NMDA\u2010mediated short\u2010term depression involves endocytosis of AMPA receptors and requires PKC activity. In contrast, NMDAR\u2010dependent LTD requires activation of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling and involves endocytosis of presynaptic components, the dephosphorylation of GluR1/AMPA receptors, and a reduction in the size of release sites. These novel findings suggest a mechanistic relationship between NMDA\u2010mediated short\u2010term depression and long\u2010term depression that depends on activation of mGluR5s and L\u2010type calcium channels. These data suggest models of bidirectional regulation of basolateral amygdala plasticity that are related to synaptic scaling mechanisms, and may be relevant to the mechanism of fear conditioning.<EOD> A comparative study of the effects of nifedipine and 5-(N,N-diethylamino)nicotinamide-4'-sulfonamide on platelet aggregation and experimental thrombosis.\nOral administration of one of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, nifedipine, exerts inhibitory effects on both in vitro platelet aggregation and experimental thrombosis.

Two in-line diffusers were placed side by side in the centre of the room along with an air quality monitor. Samples were collected at regular time intervals over a three-day period. The results found that over the course of a three-day period, a 13-inch in-line diffuser was able to remove 86% of the particulate matter within 4 m of the diffuser, whereas the 1-inch in-line diffuser removed 60% from a distance of 3 m. The results concluded that an in-line diffuser was able to remove particulates much further into a room than current recommendations suggest.\n\n# Introduction\nIndoor air quality has a significant impact on human health and psychological development, and often times it needs to be improved as the health implications of unclean indoor air may have a greater impact on a particular population. The implications of the quality of indoor air on human health have been documented in many scientific studies showing that indoor air can, in some cases, be worse than outdoor air as it is subjected to various types of emissions and pollutions. A study was conducted in a California office building to assess how the indoor air quality compared to the outdoor air quality, and the study concluded that the indoor air quality of the office building was significantly worse than that of the outdoor air, with many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside being much higher than those of the outdoor air.\nResearch has shown that even when the outside air is clean, indoor air may include several airborne particulates and pollutants, which may have serious impacts on the",

Allergic asthma represents a significant and increasing health problem that affects 1-20% of the population, with children being the most affected. Allergic asthma is caused by airway inflammation mediated by allergens and pollutants and is associated with respiratory symptoms that progress to irreversible airflow obstruction with disease severity. Currently, immunotherapy is the only treatment capable of modifying the disease course; however, this therapeutic intervention does not induce or maintain a long-term protection against the immune response to inhalant allergens in all patients, which is an important disadvantage. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new vaccine (Sci/Glob) in a cohort of Mexican patients allergic to D. pteronyssinus. Methodology. The current study took place between July and November 2020, at the Allergy Clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Security, Toluca, Mexico. A total of 23 patients were enrolled in the study, all of whom suffered from mild and persistent asthma due to D. pteronyssinus from previous allergy tests (SPT/prick) and had a serum specific IgE (sIgE) level >0.7 KU/L using commercial tests. All patients started the treatment with the standard protocol (1 dose/week). During the treatment, there was a 40% decrease (p\u22640.001) in the number of sneezes, accompanied by the reduction of the sIgE levels over time. The treatment was well tolerated by all volunteers. No changes in lung function or in the clinical presentation of the disease were observed.",

You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to provide reliable and comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects from the patient's perspective. The adverse effect has a three-point scale: 0) No adverse effect observed; 1) Mild adverse effects that would resolve quickly with intervention; and 2) Severe adverse effects that would resolve quickly with continued intervention. You should make a trial-level assessment of adverse effects for each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of adverse effects.\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life.

Higher metastasis rate and poor prognosis were often observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact for immune cell markers in metastasis rate and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.Materials and methods: In this study, we first identified a cluster of four immune-related genes through univariate Cox regression analysis and established a risk model by combining those four genes. Then, we determined the prognosis value of our risk model in lung adenocarcinoma. To explore the correlation between our risk model and patients' clinical features, clinical correlation analysis were conducted in lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we analyzed the potential molecular signaling pathways underlying the prognostic value of four immune related genes (PD1, IL2, IRF3 and TNFSF10).Results: In total, 532 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 366) and a validation",

As part of this review data are analysed using factor scores derived from the EPI and two measures of Masculine-Feminine Orientation in addition to the two original personality scales. It is suggested that Eysenck's theory is invalidated by recent studies which show no cross-sex differences on measures of Psychoticism or the newly derived scale of Pure-Psychoticism. The theory is supported by the findings that there are very few cross-sex differences on the original Extraversion-Introversion scale and on the new factor of Social Aversiveness.

Our patient, however, complained of hearing loss after the use of hydrogen peroxide-soaked gauze for ETT suctioning. She reported that she had the same symptoms after the use of gauze soaked with other disinfectants, including chlorhexidine gluconate, povidone-iodine, and sodium hypochlorite. Furthermore, she had a complaint of tinnitus, which was resolved when she was discharged from the study ICU. Thus, the mechanism may be related to a hydroperoxidation reaction or a peroxidation of membrane proteins by hydrogen peroxide. Although it has not been reported in the literature, hydrogen peroxide is known to have damaging effects on the inner ear, particularly when an excessive amount is administered.

However, the utility of this treatment is unclear in high-risk IPMN.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in patients who underwent endoscopic pancreatic resection for IPMN from April 2016 to October 2019. S-IPMN was considered the high-risk group, and E-IPMN was considered the low-risk group.Results: Ninety-seven patients were included. The proportion of men was higher in the S-IPMN group than in the E-IPMN group with a significant difference. In all patients, 161 pancreatic juice samples (64 samples in the E-IPMN group and 97 samples in the S-IPMN group) were extracted for cytology, including brushing cytology and cell block/liquid-based cytology. The positivity rates of both cytologies were higher in the S-IPMN group than in the E-IPMN group (61/97 [pap] and 60/64 [smear], respectively), with significant differences. For high-risk IPMN, a total of 121 pancreatic juice samples were extracted. Among them, the rate of positive cytology in the S-IPMN group was 26/36 (72.2%), and that in the E-IPMN group was 5/26 (19.2%), with a significant difference.

However, the mechanisms underlying vascular MMP activation are not well defined. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2010mediated activation of MMP\u20108 and a specific MMP\u20102 activator, MMP\u201014, participate in vascular smooth muscle cell migration. Methods and results: We transfected the MMP\u201014 gene into a vascular smooth muscle cell\u2010rich human umbilical vein (HUV) endothelial cell line and then injured the transfected HUVECs with PDGF for a 2\u2010hour incubation. Compared with cells without MMP\u201014 transfection, gelatin zymography showed that MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20108 activities were significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased in MMP\u201014\u2010transfected HUVECs. Next, we treated intact HUVECs with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the superoxide anion\u2010generating compound 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis(2\u2010aminopropane) dihydrochloride, or the hydroxyl radical\u2010generating compound FeCl2/ascorbate for 2 hours. All these treatments induced MMP\u20102 activation and significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased the MMP\u20108 activity, suggesting that ROS\u2010mediated mechanisms are involved in the activation of MMP\u20108. Additionally, ROS\u2010mediated MMP\u20108 activation in intact HUVECs led to a significantly (P <\u200a0.05) increased cell number migrating into the culture\u2010insert\u2010coated membranes. However, an MMP\u20108\u2010antagonizing peptide significantly (P <\u200a0.05) decreased cell migration into the culture\u2010insert\u2010coated membranes. Finally",

Background:Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and are diagnosed histologically and clinically. The Crohn\u2019s and colitis diseases are often associated with long-term adverse outcomes and are typically treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and surgery, which comes with the added effect of psychological distress. Therefore, there is an increased interest in identifying prognostic indicators in both pediatric- and adult-onset IBDs to guide personalized therapy and monitoring. Methods:We conducted a search of the MEDLINE databases to retrieve the articles published from January 1998 to June 2010 with the keywords: (1) \u201cinflammatory bowel diseases\u201d OR \u201cinflammatory bowel \u201c AND (2) \u201cbiological markers\u201d OR \u201cbiochemical markers\u201c OR \u201cdiagnostic markers\u201d OR (3) \u201cCrohn\u2019s disease\u201d OR \u201ccolitis\u201d OR (4) \u201cbiochemical parameters.\u201d We included papers published in English that investigated specific diagnostic markers of IBDs.

        "output": "Q. How do you find a group to test your system?\n\n\nA. To test your data, you could create data from previous patients or synthesize it from a variety of source in order to form an artificial population. There are a few methods that you can use to simulate such a population and generate the synthetic data required for a clinical trial:\n   1.  Random sample: In many cases, for clinical trials which are designed to be large and generalizable in terms of target population, it might be sufficient to randomly sampling from the data from the database to create a trial sample population. \n   2.  Generate synthetic data from a pre-existing, representative data set\n   3.  Generate synthetic data from a normal distribution\n   4.  Generate synthetic data from machine learning or natural language processing model results\n\n    \nAs you can see, there are many options to test your system. Generally, the first choice is random samples.\n\n---\n\nQ. How do we make the report?\n\n\nA. To write the report, you could use the command [Report](index.md#mdp_report) to run the templates, or manually create a report yourself. The template is written in YAML, which is a light-weight, human-readable data description language.\nThere are two ways to generate a report.\n\nYou could use yml2report to convert data to a yaml report. A YAML report can then be given to an editor or rendered as webpage as desired.\nPlease review [Report generation using yml2report](index.md#mdr_reportgeneration-using-command-yml2report)\n\nAlternatively, you could use template directly. You can use the command [Report Generation With Template (reportmd)](index.md#reportmd_reportgeneration-using-templates) to generate reports with data and templates.\n \n\n---\n\nQ. What tools to we need to train and evaluate the model?\n\nA.\n\nTo train and evaluate the model, we can use any machine learning learning framework and tools with tensorflow, keras, sklearns, etc.\nYou also need to use a library to visualize the results of a model. One of the most popular visualization libraries is seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas.  Please review [Visualization](",

There is currently an emerging understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human immune responses. It was reported that infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in rapid activation of proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, expansion of both innate (including NK-cells) and adaptive immune cells (including memory B-cells and antibody-producing plasmablasts), and induction of specific antibody titers. In this study, a longitudinal immunological study was conducted in 58 patients to evaluate the immunological responses during the early-stage and the late-stage of severe COVID-19. The number of lymphocyte subsets significantly decreased between hospital admission (17.6-25.2 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL) and 28 days later in the early stages of COVID-19 patients (16.1-17.0 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL). Thereafter, the lymphocyte number recovered to around 14.5-16.1 \u00d7 10 3 cell/\u03bcL in the late stages of the COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses and neutralizing antibody were detected in most patients, and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM responses were low in comparison. Based on our results, it is important to prepare for the surge of COVID-19 cases in the future.\n\n# Introduction\nAt the end of 2019, a new viral infectious disease was discovered in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, causing serious pneumonia.

Chemotherapy was administered every three weeks. Thirty patients received the whole treatment, 10 received only the combination of 5-FU and folinic (10/10) or 5-FU (5/5). Forty-two percent objective responses were obtained. The response rate was 47% for gastric tumours and 63% for distant metastatic disease. The most common toxicities were vomiting, alopecia and leukopenia. The authors conclude that the combination of 5-FU with folinic acid is very effective in the treatment of locally advanced inoperative gastric carcinoma and has also significant activity against distant metastatic disease. This protocol is also well tolerated and can be used safely in an outpatients clinic setting, although 32% of the patients required supportive measures to prevent leukopenia. The authors suggest the administration of cisplatin in 3 divided doses with a minimum interval of 6 hours and at least 7 days apart.<EOD> Antimicrobial susceptibility against Staphylococcus spp. from patients at a Tanzanian children's hospital\n\nObjective: To determine the prevalence and susceptibility to selected antimicrobials of Staphylococcus spp. from patients at a Tanzanian children's hospital.

We observed that during the first several days after surgery the rats exhibited transient hyperlipidemia. However, during the last 7 to 10 days before mortality, the blood lipid levels gradually decreased and all rats showed low serum cholesterol levels just prior to death. Moreover, during the last 1 to 2 days before mortality, the serum free fatty acids level began to decrease as well. All of the above suggest that the abdominal adherence of poly(vinyl) alcohol adhesive used to occlude the common bile duct in Sprague-Dawley rats is not a factor in serum lipid alterations, or in the development or severity of hepatomegaly induced in these rats by poly(vinyl alcohol) adhesive.<EOD> The role of endogenous and exogenous substance p on gastric emptying and acid secretion.\nThe role of histamine-containing neurons in gastric mot",

Twenty-four radiographs of primary molars, obtained from digital storage phosphor plates, were digitalized. Three dentists with different academic and clinical backgrounds were selected to determine the level of agreement between themselves. To evaluate the level of agreement between the observers and expert radiologist, 145 radiographs were assessed by the dentists. After the assessments were completed, a sample of 37 randomly selected digital images were reviewed by each dentist and periapical radiologist. The inter- and intra-rater levels were calculated by means of Kappa statistics. The data were tabulated in order to evaluate the frequency values. The agreement levels for pulpal and apical pathologies between the dentists were evaluated as follows: excellent between dentists 1 and 2; very good between dentists 1 or 2 and expert radiologist; and good for dentists 3 and 4. When all of the assessments were analyzed together, the inter-rater agreement levels were moderate to good, in descending order, for dentists 3 and 4. The intra-rater agreement levels were very good to excellent for all of the observers. In conclusion, the intra-rater diagnoses were better than the inter-rater diagnoses and when the experts were compared to the dentists, a higher inter-rater agreement level was observed for the pulpal diagnosis.

Let us begin with food which has not been digested, and which cannot pass safely. Then we have meat, especially pork, and especially the flesh of sick animals; and we have the foods that cause gout, and the foods of the lower animals which are not human food; and we have food which has not been well prepared or stored; while perhaps the greatest source of indigestible matter is the drink which is the favourite beverage, and in which people are so careless of hygiene and cleanliness. These I hold to be the real causes of what they term \" bilious diarrhoea,\" and I believe, if it were possible, that the greatest number of cases of diarrhoea would be cut short were the drink and the food taken only under strict hygienic conditions.\nBut there are other things besides drink and food which may be the occasional cause of diarrhoea.\nWe find sometimes what has been called \"water-brash,\" which consists of half-digested food washing round the stomach, and then running down the intestine, which can be easily diagnosed by looking at the stools. Then we find many patients who have some sort of acute disease will have diarrhoea with their acute malady, and this usually ceases as soon as the acute symptoms cease. Then we have the \"intestinal fevers,\" such as typhoid, cholera, and so on, with the constant stool; but as this is beyond discussion I will not say anything of it further.\nThen we have the bacteria in the intestines, and we have the parasitic diseases, the worms and the round worms and the thread worms, which are not yet known to produce diarrhoea, but which may do and which give rise to it in conjunction with the other causes",

This cytokine exerts its principal activity during the early stages of leukocyte recruitment, being involved in angiogenesis and cell proliferation and migration or in inflammatory cell activation and differentiation. In these processes IL\u20108 regulates the expression of other cytokines (such as GM\u2010CSF and TGF\u2010\u03b2), chemotaxis, infiltration of the tumor masses by leukocytes, and tumor growth. Concentrations of IL\u20108 in ascitic fluid, in pleural effusions, and in plasma are elevated in patients with ovarian carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, and high concentrations of this cytokine also occur in the peritoneal fluid and in plasma of endometrium affected patients. In human tumors, the neoplastic cells may themselves secrete IL\u20108.

This may lead to an increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP, surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of the aqueous outflow.

A total of 403 Chinese adults completed questionnaires comprised primarily of the Weight Concerns Measure-Chinese version, the Weight Bias Internalization Scale, the Weight Loss Intention Scale, the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, and selected items from the Exercise Recovery and Motivation Examination.

The molecular adsorption processes of the cation and anion separately on an ideal hydrophilic surfaces as well as the mixed adsorption on hydrophilic silica surface are explored at first. A similar mechanism is adopted for the adsorption of the cation and anion separately on hydrophobic PS surfaces. Furthermore, the adsorption and mixing between hydrophilic silica surface and hydrophobic PS surfaces are also investigated. According to the mean force analysis, there are two adsorption states for cations and anions including the partially adsorbed state and the deeply adsorbed state with both cation and anion involved. The deeply adsorbed state with cation and anion simultaneously adsorbed on hydrophilic silica surfaces is the minimum energy state with a larger ads",

A total study group of 4769 patients were categorized into two age groups: under 10 years of age group (UYG) and 10 years and older (OYG). While UYG decreased from 43% of the total study group in 1990 to 6.9% in 2010, OYG increased from 57% to 93.1% during the same period. The leading etiology in all groups in 1990 was thermal (32%); it reduced to 26% (UYG) and 23.5% (OYG) in 2010. Flame burns showed 36% reduction from 20% in 1990 to 13% in 2010. Electrical burns increased from 18.5% in 1990 to 39.6% in 2010. Burn etiologies increased and were highest for house-hold chemicals and kitchen burns in India. Changing demographics in burn patients of Mumbai over a 20 year period were attributed to changes in the etiology of burns based on the cultural, social, economic factors and the improvement in socioeconomic status on the part of the patients. More females were treated over the duration of the study period. This may be related to the increasing social status of Indian women who are now seen as bread earners. Young children under 10 years also showed a decreasing trend and elderly patients showed increasing trend in number treated from 1990 to 2010.

The moment sequence is derived from the proposed distribution, a generalisation of the Gauss distribution, based on the proposed multivariate density function and the moment generating function. This sequence contains the mean and four moments of the remote sensing image in the same form as other classical moment models, which facilitates image degradation analysis. It is shown that the proposed sequence is capable of obtaining higher estimation accuracy than previously derived moment estimators, which could be used to obtain better estimation of the image degradation in terms of the geometric accuracy and texture details. The simulation and image interpretation tests are conducted to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. Sensors 2016, 16, 34 2 of 16image degradation, particularly in terms of the geometric properties. However, the classical moment models fail to directly assess the geometric and optical characteristics of remote sensing images.To address the above problem, a set of improved moments were proposed by Huang[23], Jiang [24], and Wu [25,26]to estimate the degree of geometric distortion in aerial orthophoto images. These moments are derived from the proposed multivariate distribution, with a closed-form calculation of parameters achieved by fitting an image data set. The theoretical model is very easy to implement, and can be applied to all types of remote sensing image; however, this type of model only reflects the overall trend of geometric distortion in remote sensing images, and is not easy to quantitatively describe image texture. Some new moments were proposed by Zhu[27]in order to estimate both geometric and textural characteristics in an image. To obtain an effective set of moments for image degradation assessment, Zhu utilized the theory of the moment of image degradation proposed by Jalali [28], which described the spatial structure and texture of the image. Zhu compared the modified moment sequence with the classical moment sequence in order to better estimate the degree of geometric degradation in images and further evaluate the image quality. Compared with the classical moments, the modified sequence of moments could better describe the geometric and text",

However, the relationships between the plateletto-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival of patients undergoing surgery for upper tract UC (UTUC) remains unknown. This study investigated the prognostic significance of PLR in these patients. Patients and methods: We included 123 consecutive patients with UTUC who underwent surgery after diagnosis at Fremantle Hospital and Health Service between October 2002 and November 2015. Clinicopathological characteristics of patients were reviewed. The association of preoperative PLR with other clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes was assessed. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate 5-year cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS), which were compared by using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify factors affecting the CSS and OS. Results: The cohort of 14 men and 103 women had a median age of 70 (interquartile range [IQR], 66-74). The median preoperative PLR in all patients was 186.4 (IQR, 135.7-256.2). Preoperative PLR was not associated with the disease and clinicopathological characteristics of UTUC patients except in patients with grade 3 renal function (p = 0.04). Multivariate analyses indicated preoperative PLR was an independent factor in the prediction of both CSS (p = 0.03) and OS (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The results from our study indicated an association between the higher preoperative PLR with worse outcomes in patients with UTUC. PLR was suggested to be a better predictor to evaluate the postoperative survival.\n\n# Introduction\nUpper tract uro",

All patients had elevated hepatic transaminase levels and had a histological score greater than 9 points on scale from 0 to 18. They were treated with a combination of alpha interferon and recombinant leukocyte alpha interferon. The trial aim was to evaluate safety and tolerability, and also to evaluate the dose escalation schedule. Efficacy end points were complete and partial relapse-free response, and progression of disease. The drug combination did not increase the toxicity observed with alpha interferon alone, and no deaths resulted from treatment. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled. The drug administration schedule consisted of four consecutive treatment cycles of 10 days each every 8 weeks. The alpha interferon dose was 6 MU initially, and the leukocyte alpha interferon dose was 1 MU. Dose escalation was at week 4, to 12 MU for alpha interferon and 2 MU for leukocyte alpha interferon. The mean maximal hepatic transaminase levels after treatment were normalized in half of the treated patients. Two patients achieved sustained full remission. Ten patients (34%) showed a sustained amelioration of liver disease and normalization of hepatic transaminase levels for a period of at least 3 months or longer after the last treatment. All patients had a favourable tolerance to treatment as assessed by both clinical and laboratory evaluation. The Phase I study design was adapted to the specific properties of antihepatitis C virus drugs with the aim of identifying the minimum dosage and schedule in phase II studies with an objective of minimizing toxicity while maintaining efficacy end points of the study. The authors found that the dosage schedule used in this Phase I study does not produce greater toxicity than the reference treatment with alpha interferon alone and may be applied in future phase II studies to treat hepatitis C disease.<EOD> A Flexible Biodegradable Hydrogel Dressing for Sealing Wounds\n\n [bib_ref]  Chitosan hydrogel/",

As the SCD population is one of the most commonly prescribed acetaminophen (APAP) in children, it is imperative for providers to closely follow these patients to ensure they are not experiencing liver disorders that result in a severe hepatitis from APAP. Two pediatric patients, ages 1.4 and 10.4, were seen in consultations for an emergent workup of liver disorders after APAP was discovered in their urine and blood. While both patients did not have documented liver disease or history of liver damage, APAP poisoning was not ruled out. The first patient's blood test was not indicative of APAP poisoning and was discharged, while the second patient underwent a 72-hour urine collection for APAP. Both patients were instructed to stop using the Tylenol (APAP) for 24 hours, and the result of their 72 urine collection ruled out APAP poisoning. While liver tests in healthy children are often normal, some literature has revealed that 10% of children given APAP for a few days had acute liver damage, so it is important to observe the proper amount of APAP that pediatric patients with SCD or SCT that are taking APAP are receiving and closely watch the liver function test results in these patients.Abstract:Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or sickle cell trait (SCT) have a unique disease prognosis that consists of a multitude of complications ranging from delayed bone age, avascular necrosis (AVN",

Methods: This was a retrospective study comparing findings in 40 consecutive non-pregnant women to those in 40 pregnant women and those in 35 early preterm labor patients. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed and T1-weighted images (T1WI), T2-weighted images (T2WI), fat-suppressed T2WI (FST2WI), and gadoliniumenhanced fat-suppressed T1WI (EFIGS) were analyzed and compared. Measurements on the T1WI were used to obtain canal diameter and canal length, and measurements on the PETRA image were used to measure fatty infiltration. We evaluated the distance between the posterior ligaments, lateral vertebral body, and posterior ligament to the cervical canal, which was termed the posterior height and posterior ligament, which was termed the Torg ratio. The PETRA images were used to evaluate disk height. Results: Canal diameter, canal length, and the difference in the diameter of the cervical canal were significantly greater in the pregnant group. PETRA measurements showed significantly greater canal diameter, posterior height, intracanal fat space, lateral vertebral body height, disk height, and disk height at the L4/5 and L5/S1 levels in the pregnant group.

Blood specimens were also drawn after fasting. The checklist was made up of four parts on sociodemographic data and personal history, obstetric history, obstetric examination, and clinical evaluation.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nAn evaluation of the nutritional state was done with three complemental tests: weight, height and thickness.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA previous history of perinatal disease is the major risk factor (p < 0.0001) for perinatal morbidity. Other risk factors shown are: being an adolescent or a woman aged 35 or above, living in a low socioeconomic level, not being a housewife, unscheduled delivery, non-use of antenatal care, pregnancy of more than 37 weeks, presence of urinary tract infection, fever, anemia, and a history of hypertension. When the nutritional state of the women is analyzed it is confirmed the relationship between poor nutritional state and perinatal morbidity. The relationship between parity and perinatal morbidity tends to be shown in women aged 35 and over. The presence of anemia is linked to prem",

If you have this question and this type of patient, you should think these patient note contents in the following way. For instance, you can think as follows: \n- This patient's age is 66. The inclusion criteria of the clinical trial require the inclusion within 6 months of age, but not within 6 months and 6 month of age. Thus, this patient's age is not consistent with the clinical trial's inclusion criteria. Therefore, this patient may not be referred to this clinical trial. Note that whether you agree with the assessment of eligibility in this trial is your decision. \n- This patient has been diagnosed with cardiac artery thrombosis. The inclusion criteria of the clinical trial require patients (including children and infants) with a thrombosis, but this one does not specify which area of the body thrombosis is. Thus, this patient's thrombosis area is not consistent with the inclusion criteria of the trial. Moreover, in another clinical trial, it is required that one is diagnosed with a systemic thrombus. The patient's thrombus is limited to the femoral artery, so the patient is highly likely to be referred to that trial.\n\nAfter you have checked this problem in the `Note`, let\\s think other questions.

For instance, you can think so: \n - This patient's diagnosis is cardiac artery thrombosis, not systemic thrombosis. Therefore, it's highly likely to be referred to this trial. \n - A bruit indicates an arterial thrombosis. This patient's thrombosis is arterial, so it's highly likely to be referred to this trial.\n - If doctors know the reason for the thrombosis, they will find out whether the therapy has a thrombosis area.

Some patients had a history of smoking. The clinical symptoms were non-specific and lack of typical manifestation. The physical examination and laboratory examination were normal. B-ultrasonography and chest X-ray were not so useful in the diagnosis of this disease. Bronchoscopy observation did not appear any specific pathological characteristics. Pathological diagnosis was required after obtaining biopsies for histology examination and immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis of LELC should be according to at least the following the conditions: (1) the tumor cells showed a nest-like architectural arrangement; (2) the tumor cells were closely arranged and showed lymphocytic infiltration. And immunohistochemistry had to showed cytoplasmic CD56 expression, and negative of CD20 and CD3 in the tumor cells. (3) no in situ lesions and other primary tumor were found. There were some differences in clinical manifestation and pathological features, even with same immunophenotype, between epithelial cell LELC and nasopharyngeal LELC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was no effective treatment for LELC based on the experience from current cases.

To assess the inactive enzyme, two different approaches are possible: we can compare the enzymatic activity of a preparation of enzyme with or without activator present; or we can use competitive inhibitors of the activated enzyme to estimate the fraction of total enzyme lacking activator. We chose the latter technique because of the extreme sensitivity of the activated enzyme to hydrolytic inactivation. The method used by Dr Chao and Dr Cocchiso was only one of many possible inhibitor analogs. The inactivation of plasminogen activator by soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 units/ml), e-aminocaproic acid (100mg/ml), p-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone (300,ug/ml),and p-aminobenzoyl arginine (100mg/ml) were not significantly inhibited by the addition of activator or antibody for either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator. We were also interested in trying to inhibit the plasminogen activators by using the plasminogen activator inhibitors isolated from human serum (3, 4). Again, however, there was no effect on tissue or urinary activator with the purified plasminogen activator inhibitor proteins studied. The results of Dr Chao and Dr Cocchiso are certainly interesting. The methods used were novel and could well have been effective in demonstrating differences in the ability of these two activators to bind to activator antibodies, had we been able to supply them with the purified antibodies in sufficient amounts. Unfortunately, we have been unable to raise antibodies to the purified activators and therefore it was impossible to carry out the additional experiments suggested.<EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nA large international study showed a relationship between the use of antidepressants and the onset of hyponatraemia which was not explained by concomitant diseases,",

They are involved in processes ranging from the initiation of development to response to stress and inhibition of pathogens. Thus, phytohormones represent important targets for agriculture in the context of crop yield and nutritive value and also to tackle threats to human health, such as the increasing amount of toxic agents via the food chain. Here, we describe genetic and physiological analyses of a new brassinosteroid-insensitive mutant, tbr. The tbr plant displays increased tolerance toward brassinosteroids, a steroid group of hormones essential for many processes in plant development and growth. Analysis of brassinosteroid metabolism in tbr plants revealed normal levels of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, transport, and accumulation. Instead, tbr plants are characterized by a hyper-sensitive phenotype toward elevated levels of brassinosteroids (at doses inducing wild-type plant growth promotion), manifested most prominently in plant stem growth, root branching, and trichome formation (i.e. the density of glandular structures). These phenotypes are independent of the developmental stage of each tested tissue, thus reflecting a rather general increase in brassinosteroid response. The tbr seedlings are also hypersensitive toward ethylene-inhib",

Bacteria with pathogen suppressive activities towards R. solani have been reported; however, only a few such studies have been conducted in the Indian context. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge regarding identification of rhizoctonia antagonistic bacteria, strain development, in vitro and in vivo pathogen inhibitory tests and various applications of bacterial antagonists in plant production systems. The review shows that phytopathogenic R. solani has a wide range of hosts; however, only a few reports are available regarding the in vitro antagonistic ability of soil bacteria against this common soil-borne fungus. Bacterial strains from a wide range of genera, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Serratiobacter, are capable of inhibiting Rhizoctonia spp. in vitro and when used in growing media in association with seeds or plant parts. A limited number of field studies from different parts of the globe also indicate that the application of antagonists alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers leads to increased yields of host crops. Hence, the use of antagonistic bacteria seems to be a promising tool in controlling soil-borne pathogens in the field conditions, but to be feasible, more intensive research programmes are needed in regard to various steps of the process.<EOD> Role of microRNA-29b-3p in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperuricemia\n\nBackground:",

All three of these channels experience different degrees of competition from each other. The Canadian pharmacy distribution channels have been developed as they are today in part as a consequence of legislated and natural monopolies, localized regulation and licensing of entities, and historical practices. The structure of these distribution chains results in a variety of market failures. Consequently, the pharmacy distribution channel in Canada can evolve substantially to the betterment of the health of Canadians. Improvements are possible, and must be made, since drug product (medicines) and the drug distribution process are fundamental determinants of therapeutic and economic outcomes for all patients. We conclude that the Canadian pharmacy distribution channels must evolve and propose that the evolution of this channel should be based on the principles of efficiency, economic considerations, and equity, with a focus on maximizing overall societal value. This will require substantial changes in the structure of the three distribution channels and the reengineering of the pharmaceutical industry's business model. Some of these changes are possible now, and several are possible in the foreseeable future, through legislative intervention and the removal of impediments to market forces. The future distribution structure will also depend on changes in the way drugs are priced and paid for, including changes in the regulation of pharmacy-reimbursable generic products. We recommend that the future structure of the Canadian pharmacy distribution channel should be based on the following principles: 1) maximize therapeutic and economic outcomes (i.e., maximizing the amount of",

This condition is often diagnosed during pregnancy. Infants with Down's syndrome have a distinctive pattern of physical traits. These traits often include unusually small fingers, a bulbous appearance to the stomach region, a flattened face, and a short neck. The severity of the signs and symptoms related to Down's syndrome varies from child to child. People with mild to moderate Down's syndrome often have some of the physical challenges, but to a lesser degree than those who have severe Down's syndrome. Children with Down's syndrome develop a series of physical, motor, cognitive, and behavioral challenges that may be life-threatening.  **2018**\n* Huntington disease, also known as Huntington's chorea, is a rare hereditary autosomal-dominant neuropsychiatric disorder caused by a cytosine-adenineadenine (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4. Huntington disease commonly manifests in adults, often during their prime. The disorder is characterized by motor dysfunction - particularly chorea - psychological symptoms, and cognitive decline. This disease is incurable. Huntington's gene can also lead to a more severe juvenile form with much earlier onset of symptomatology, the prognosis of which is also grimmer.

This is a nice program that makes some good advances in automated clinical note processing, however, still leaves some shortcomings that need to be addressed:\nFirst, I will re-express my concern about the difficulty in making the correct determination of sentence boundaries. This appears to be a more difficult than some of the other tasks. I know that you believe that the problems are because of the very short sentences or the very short notes. While that may be partially the truth, I do not think that it is all of the difficulty. I believe that there is enough material with complex syntax to make it very hard to determine the right sentence boundary. In my own work for the CQI task, I found that it is more possible to determine if a particular word or phrase in a sentence is either a noun or a verb with a simple list of terms than to be able to determine sentence boundary.\nIn addition, there is a lot of negativity in the output of the system that makes an unskilled user suspect that there are actual problems with the program. For example, in the example: \"A physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right femoral artery \" what is meant by \", \"? The first term \"A physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman \" is a negative-only phrase that indicates that the patient is not a physician or a 67-year-old woman, etc. The \"who underwent cardiac catheterization\" is also problematic, because of its negativism, but since the previous term is a list of negatives, it is clear that it is an inappropriate term, but it would not be my first choice to put there. But I really get it upset when I see the negativism of the phrase \"via the right femoral artery \" , because not only is this correct wording as it is spelled above, but it is also a correct statement that the catheterization was performed through the femoral artery in the right leg. In addition, it is clear that this is not a problem that the physician or the patient had.\nThe second area of concern was with the lack",

        "output": "## Explanation\nTo train this task, we want you to build two models. One for the task of patient-level eligibility assessment. The target for the model is 31 labels which were used in the dataset. The second model is for the trial-level eligibility assessment, where the target number of labels depends on the trials, but it's approximately 60 labels.\n- **Patient-level task**\n- The task is to assess patient-level eligibility. The model will be trained to give a probabilistic estimate of eligibility for the patient. It depends on various aspects, for example: how the patient's condition changes over time, so it is better to train a system which takes past information into consideration. The system may also take into account comorbidities, which could be important for explaining why the patient is not eligible/eligible to participate in a clinical study. A natural approach to training involves learning this from a large dataset of patient records, where patient-level eligibility status has ground truth labels.\n\n- **Trial-level task**\n- The second task is to predict trial-level eligibility, which is different from patient-level eligibility. This information is used when patients participate in a clinical study, for example in trials with no or few patients, or when some patients from the same trial are excluded by other factors (smoking, allergic to drugs, etc. ...). The model will give an estimate on the likelihood of a patient referring to clinical trial, without a time-constraint. For this task, we can also obtain a trial's eligibility assessments.\n\n### Pipeline:\nWe recommend to design a pipeline to train the models. Pipeline is defined as a set of models, data-pre/processing methods, and hyperparameters, that we train for better results. This pipeline can help us to avoid the time consuming task of searching for new data-pre/processing methods for extracting the information that our neural network needs to make a better prediction.\nPipeline:\n```\n- read in notes from Pubmed - remove columns not important and store data to the dataframe\n- use a preprocessing method - for example remove stopwords\n- use some feature extraction method, for example TF-IDF\n- use the dataframe, and the",

The most common respiratory pathogens were rhinovirus (45%) and respiratory syncytial virus (34%). No major differences were found between antibiotic and clinical follow-up groups. The average age was 5 years in the antibiotic group and 4,6 years in the clinical follow-up group. Those older than 4 years had a higher chance of requiring antibiotic treatment. The length of stay was longer in antibiotic-treated patients (4,4 versus 2,8 days, p=0,01). Patients admitted to the hospital had a significantly worse outcome (p<0,001).

His liver biopsy findings were consistent with acute allograft rejection, and he was given steroid intravenously for that indication. His serum alkaline phosphatase level increased significantly within a day, which prompted review of previous radiographs. Radiographs revealed radiolucencies within the liver graft with no perfusion in segments II to III, thus indicating complete thrombosis. The patient underwent transjugular liver biopsy, which revealed extensive macrovesicular steatosis without evidence of thrombus. Due to poor clinical response to steroids and elevated liver enzymes, the decision was eventually made to return the patient to the operating room for an urgent retransplantation.

The tissues comprising tendons are called tensional connective tissues, and the cellular component in these are called tenocytes.\n\n# Tendon development\nAs the body grows, the long bones form at their ends, and in order to allow the muscles to attach to them, the tendons must develop. The formation of the tendons consists of three steps, all of which are called tendon differentiation.\n\n## Proliferation\nThe tenocytes proliferate during the proliferative phase.\n\n## Differentiation\nThe tenocytes differentiate into types that can be distinguished by their shape as follows:\n- Fibroblasts, which are the majority of the tenocytes. They attach themselves to the end of the tendon and begin to produce various substances which make up the extracellular matrix. The major substances produced by the fibroblasts are collagen, elastin, and proteoglycan.\n- Chondrions, which develop into fibrous cartilage. They provide the scaffold for the tendon, like cartilage provides the scaffold of bones.\n- Osteoblasts, which develop into bone. These develop into Haversian systems which are the spaces in which blood vessels travel through the tendon to supply blood to the cells and make sure there is transport of waste from the cells.\n- Myoblasts, which differentiate into myocytes, and then eventually develop into muscle fibres.\nIf there is a tendon which is not utilised, or one which is not needed any longer, then the cells will enter apoptosis and slowly degenerate, usually taking about 65 years.\n\n## Tendon maturity\nAfter the tendon has been fully-formed, then it enters a phase of growth called the maturing",

During one session, participants were asked to smoke only 1 cigarette at 1 hour, and during the other session, they received a moderate dose of alcohol (0.5 mg of alcohol per kilogram of person weight) or placebo. Smoking, urge scores, and craving ratings and effects were reported. The craving task consisted of two phases: an anticipatory phase, where smokers were presented with cigarettes and then received instructions on how to prepare for the experiment, and a cue-elicited phase, where 30 pictures related to smoking were sequentially presented.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistical comparisons within subjects revealed a significant decrease in the smoking rate and in the urge scores during the first hour (p < .001). Furthermore, a significant reduction of smoking rate was observed in sessions with alcohol relative to a session with placebo (p = .049). However, a significant reduction in the urge scores only reached in the cue-elicited phase (p = .040). Also, alcohol had a significant effect on craving intensity (p = .041).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study demonstrated that administration of a moderate dose of alcohol reduced urge levels as well as the smoking rate in daily smokers, and this was evident during the anticipatory and cue-elicited phases.<EOD> Comparison of 1% and 2% intravenous lidocaine infusion for postoperative analgesia in thyroid surgery: A randomized",

The patients were subsequently followed up for six months, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant variables predicting the following outcome variables: death within six months, stroke recurrence within six months (any brain infarct), and death plus stroke recurrence during six months. Sixty-three percent of the patients had an ischaemic stroke and 37% had a haemorrhagic stroke. The risk of dying in patients diagnosed as having a TIA at admission was higher than in patients without previous TIA (50% versus 30%, p<0.05).

MF59 is a squalene-based emulsion, whereas alum is aluminium hydroxide alone. AF03 is a potent, safe, non-toxic adjuvant for preventive and therapeutic vaccines to protect against virulent viruses, bacteria and/or parasites. AF03-adjuvanted whole virus vaccines protect mice against virulent viruses or bacteria, as well as providing prophylactic and therapeutic (sterilizing and non-sterilizing) protection against malaria parasites and leishmaniasis. AF03 adjuvanted whole-cell vaccines were shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria-induced mortality by inducing a robust antibody response, while concomitantly inducing regulatory CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells that prevented the over-reaction observed in non-vaccinated sick mice. The AF03-adjuvanted wholecell S. typhi vaccine has been shown to protect children against typhoid infection; clinical studies of this vaccine are in progress. In this study, AF03 was compared with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant for the development of novel preventive/ treatment vaccines.Methods AF03 was compared with alum adjuvant in C57BL/6 and 129 Sv/Ev mice for its abilities to generate long-lasting and high-titer antibody responses to tetanus toxoid, influenza, measles, hepatitis B, plague, Ebola virus (EBOV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis, West Nile virus (WNV) and plasmodium falciparum antigens.

Relevance of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome in multiple sclerosis. North Clin. Istanb. 2021; 8(5): 494-501.The gut microbiota has been described to play a fundamental role with the pathogenesis of neurological and immunological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). According to some studies, the composition of gut microbiome influences the immune system also by modulating the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier, bacterial metabolites, proinflammatory cytokine levels and antibody response. In this context, it can be hypothesized that a dysbiotic gut microbiota can contribute to the development of MS through a proinflammatory environment. Further findings suggest that MS patients show also dysbiosis involving the whole gut. It was observed a reduced microbiome alpha diversity in MS patients, that is associated with both severity of the disease and gastrointestinal symptoms. Interestingly, there is evidence of altered bacterial populations in MS with an increased prevalence of the Bacteroides genus, and depletion of Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia species during relapse. The knowledge gained in understanding the role of gut microbiota in MS has led to novel therapeutic strategies, including microbiome alteration by probiotic intervention. Currently, there are no probiotics clinically validated for the treatment of MS, but clinical trials of probiotics supplementation are ongoing in MS patients. Probiotics, also referred as 'beneficial bacteria', are non-pathogenic bacteria that are proposed to have, under certain circumstances, beneficial effects on health. Therefore, studies will be necessary to show the beneficial effects and to assess their safety profile, in both preclinical and clinical studies, to use probiotics as a supplementary",

Amrubicin showed potent cytotoxicity to the human multiple myeloma cell lines U266, NCI-H929, and KMS-12-PE by inhibiting the expression of genes encoding multiple myeloma-associated proteins.

We report here that gains in chromosome 3p detected by comparative genomic hybridization are always associated both with overexpression and amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In turn, overexpression and amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor were not consistently seen in cell lines bearing only 3p loss of heterozygosity on microsatellite markers. These findings may suggest that either amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene is sufficient to induce expression on its own or that only a specific subset of cancers with 3p loss of heterozygosity undergo selection for amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. We also found that overexpression of the 15 to 20 kb of RNA encompassing the erbB-2 gene (c-erbB-2 gene) is associated with gain of sequence polymorphism at D3S1235. In summary, the identification of specific molecular defects within gene-coding sequences in specific breast tumors might be instrumental for designing better clinical trials for therapeutic use of targeted agents.<EOD> A method of measuring the strength of the refractive index mismatch between the cell and the surrounding liquid: the \"cavity method\".\nA simple and fast method for measuring the refractive index of immersed cells or fibre sections is described which is called 'the cavity method'.

To meet this requirement for total bromate (BrO(3)- + BrO(2-)) we developed a high-throughput method for total bromate determination by a commercially available liquid chromatograph (LC) with a diode-array detector (DAD) integrated into an automation system. We evaluated nine sample preparation techniques and compared 5 commercial bromate calibration standards for their suitability to prepare calibration curves and to carry out external quality control using our sample preparation procedure.

PTSD is prevalent in primary care settings after road traffic accident, where approximately 25% of patients meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the development of a number of efficacious behavioral and pharmacological treatments, only a minority of patients with PTSD receive mental health services. PTSD is frequently underrecognized and untreated in Emergency Department and Surgical Unit.~Then, early diagnosis and prevention of PTSD might help to identify patients with PTSD high risk and lead them to benefit of personalized cares.

These drugs are known to improve survival in many cancers, including cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, breast, kidney, and GI stromal tumors (GIST). Worldwide, over 400,000 patients per year are treated with one of these agents. HFS involves skin changes, such as swelling, peeling, and blistering of the palms and soles, which is often painful and debilitating. As a result, HFS-related symptoms can frequently lead to dose reduction and/or discontinuation of otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment. There is no treatment for HFS other than dose reduction or stopping treatment.

        "output": "__\n__\n\n## Precision\nNow what is this phrase 'precision'?\nPrecision refers to the likelihood that the study findings of a clinical trial will be the same when repeated. As the precision is enhanced, the study results are trustworthy. Conversely, the larger the extent of variation of the findings, the less accurate and less reliable the results.\nPrecision in research indicates how much a study's result can differ from the truth. For example, although the average weight of the fruits and vegetables picked from a fruit shop could be determined as 350.00 gram, the weight measurements from each vendor could be very different, if the measurements were taken at different time periods--that is the consequence of precision loss. Therefore the degree of loss is one of the features of precision.\nThere are three kinds of precision that are usually considered:\n- accuracy reflects the closeness of the measured quantity to the true value;\n- consistency indicates the consistency of the repeated measurements; and\n- repeatability is concerned with the repeatability of a study for the same result.\nIn this section, the focus is on the repeatability test. You can find out more information about the other aspects of the precision in [link1]. [LINK1].\n\n## Repeatability\nThe repeatability is concerned with the repeatability of a study for the same result. Repeatability provides an estimate of the closeness of the results of a study. In other words, it is the ability of a study to detect a change in patient condition or a change of patient's response for the study drugs.\nFor the repeatability of a clinical study, the test and its repeatability study are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nRepeatability:\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{1}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{X1}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{2}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{X2}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{dV}_{a}}&=\\frac{\\mathrm{Xa}-\\mathrm{X}}{-\\mathrm{X} \\label{repeatability-1}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{dV_{21}}}{\\mathrm{dV",

The present study was designed to address this issue.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThirty-seven patients with MI (24 anterior MI, 13 inferior MI) and 26 healthy subjects (HS) with normal coronary arteries were examined. The internal and external diameters of the ascending aorta and the mean circumferential thickness of the ascending aorta wall were measured in transverse ascending axial images. The wall thickness (WTh) was calculated by dividing the wall circumference diameter by the calculated cross-sectional area. The ascending cross-sectional area was approximated by multiplying the aortic internal diameter by a constant (0.72). We found significant differences in the ascending aortic dimensions between the MI and HS groups. The differences in the aortic internal and external diameters between the groups were due to higher values in the MI group. There was no difference in the WTh between the MI and HS groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results indicate that different alterations in aortic and cardiac dimensions are evident in MI patients in association with their different heart failure conditions. Increased ascending aortic diameters in MI patients do not appear to result from increased aortic wall thickness, but from an increase in aortic diameter caused by increased aortic perimeter length.<EOD> The",

In addition, A-A. platensis supplementation had no visible effect on the intestinal characteristics of pigs such as body weight, total body weight gain, gastrointestinal transit time and rectal temperature.Conclusions: This study reveals, for the first time, the influence of A-A. platensis on intestinal microbiota without any side-effects on livestock and piglet growth.

In recent years, the morbidity and mortality rates of CHF have been steadily increasing, which is also a public health problem.\nClinically, CHF is usually divided into four stages according to the severity of the heart disease. However, the pathogenesis of CHF is complex, and each patient has a different CHF severity.\nPlatelets (PLTs) play a role in both the progression and prognosis of CHF. Numerous studies have indicated that an imbalance in the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is a well-defined prognostic marker in patients with CHF.\nAtherosclerosis is an immune response disorder, and platelets appear to be active participants in atherosclerosis. The PLT count, a routine haemogram test, may reflect the activity of atherosclerosis. Many crosssectional and longitudinal studies have linked an elevated PLT count with an increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation and clinical vascular events. Some studies have also reported a strong positive correlation between PLT counts and atherosclerosis-related markers such as C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide .\nIn addition to the classic role of PLTs in thrombosis, growing attention is being paid to the contribution of PLTs through the release of PLT microparticles (PMPs) to atherosclerosis. PLT microparticles (PMPs) are small (1-2 \u00b5m) membranous vesicles derived from the plasma membrane of activated PLTs, which contain a cell-type transcriptionally active nucleus.\nAs a bioactive mediator, PLT microparticles have been shown to promote inflammatory cell activation.\nAn increasing",

Metazoan mtDNA ranges in size from~20 kb in nematodes to~16 kb in humans. In addition to core mitochondrial gene products, mtDNA also encodes 37 tRNAs, 22 transfer-mRNAs, and 12 short open-reading frames (ORFs) that have no annotated function but do encode transcripts and proteins in nematodes, teleost fishes (12 ORFs), and mammals (15 ORFs).

Efforts to understand and prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are hampered by a lack of high throughput assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. The only available tests to date use either low-resolution immunofluorescence or radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods that use recombinant protein fragments as antigens. These assays do not have the necessary throughput and the fragment antigen approach precludes detection of antibodies that target conformational epitopes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a high throughput 4-plex quantitative Luminex assay using full-length antigens and a unique peptide-based blocking strategy. The assay demonstrates robust seropositivity over a broad dynamic range and is a useful tool for estimating the fraction of the population with active antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. More broadly, this assay is an efficient platform for evaluating the kinetics, persistence, and antigenic coverage of humoral immune responses to human pathogens.\nT he novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has precipitated pandemic disease that has affected tens of millions of people worldwide and over 140,000 in the US .

Many of these events were initiated by pathogens in urban settings via interaction with human pathogens. These spillover events are of particular interest due to potential impacts on host populations and ecosystem structure. Here we examine the role of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a human-to-wildlife spillover pathogen from a palaeocological perspective. We compare the natural history of SARS-CoV-1, the putative zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, and its natural hosts to the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 and its natural host. Results indicate both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 fit the criteria for having a natural wildlife reservoir as these viruses have been sporadically detected for over a decade with no clear indicators of cross-species extinction. We note that the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the extent of the pandemic across wild and domestic environments, its global impact on the human population, and the fact the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified (and thus our ability to determine pre-existing evolutionary differences between natural hosts). Overall, the novel virus may have evolved to take advantage of anthropogenic-related changes in humans, bats and livestock as these taxa are important in human diets, trade and consumption; further, as such, SARS-CoV-2 may be well adapted to the global trade of humans and livestock. The importance of such a zoonotic spillover in bats and possibly pangolins is likely to be underappreciated in comparison to other wildlife taxa that may have suffered similar exposures. Ultimately, SARS-CoV-2, like many other viruses, may become a resident of the human population as it continues to evolve.Publisher'",

What is the optimal approach?\nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, with more than 182,000 new cases predicted to occur in 2003. Fortunately, most prostate cancers are indolent; the 10-year survival rate with this diagnosis exceeds 95%.1,2 However, this favorable outcome is derived from the fact that most men die with, not of, prostate cancer. Although prostate-specific antigen testing has increased the detection of disease, the proportion of men with clinically localized disease has remained unchanged.3,4 When prostate-specific antigen screening was introduced in the 1980s, most cancers in men older than 60 years were diagnosed at an early stage.5 Although it is generally thought that screening has resulted in a shift in prostate-cancer frequency from the disseminated stages to the more favorable clinical localized stages, no direct assessment has been made.5 In one study6 of the effect of prostate-specific antigen testing on prostate-cancer outcomes, the proportion of cancers diagnosed at early stages increased from 45% in 1986-1989 to 67% in 1994-1998 (62% to 75% in the subset at highest risk for the",

The phosphate-bound imipramine does not react with chlorpromazine, an indicator of tricyclic antidepressant-like drugs. The results are in line with the observed difference in the side effects of phosphate and imipramine and demonstrate the possibility of spectroscopic studies to distinguish different forms of imipramine.<EOD> A novel mutation in the KMT2D gene that causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS)\n\nBackground: Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) is a rare disorder with a presumed prevalence of approximately 1/1,000,000.

For people with SCD who do not respond to the available pharmaceutical products, the ability to prepare compounded medications by pharmacists can be beneficial. When prescribing a compounded medication, it is important to understand the indications, pharmacological properties, preparation techniques, and potential complications. Case Reports: Here, we describe 3 patients with SCD who have been receiving regular treatment with either a combination of hydroxyurea and crizanlizumab, hydroxyurea, or  hydroxyurea at the Specialty Pharmacy of Saint Mary's Center for Special Education (Phoenix, Arizona), where 3 different pharmacists prepared the compounded solutions. All 3 patients had previously been using their prescriptions through their health plan but elected to change to a compounded solution prepared by a compounding pharmacist because they were dissatisfied with the health plan's formulary product as it resulted in poor adherence and nonresponders. Two of these patients were on combination therapy, and the other patient was on monotherapy. This decision to compound a medication for these patients was an improvement in the care they were receiving compared with what they had been receiving. Conclusion: By understanding the indications, pharmacological properties, preparation techniques, and potential complications of compounded medications used to treat SCD, compounding pharmacists can effectively treat patients when necessary.<EOD> Reversal in the trends of the association between diabetes mellitus and stroke among Korean adults.\nThis study examined trends in the burden of diabetes mellitus and stroke among the Korean population.

In response to growth factors and cytokines, RTKs generate multiple intracellular signaling pathways involving protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Rho family of small GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) are well-known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, the activity of which is crucial for the formation and dynamics of various cellular compartments. These proteins are involved in the modulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, membrane protein sorting, adhesion and migration. Rho proteins play an important role in the regulation of RTKs: they link the signals from receptors and their direct downstream targets, such as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ERK1/2, Src kinases and PI3K, to the actin cytoskeleton. Rho proteins also regulate the RTK activity through a direct binding with the components of the receptor signaling system, which leads to a change in the phosphorylation status of receptors by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, Rho proteins act as a link between the receptor signaling",

Most nociceptive information is carried to the brain as action potentials traveling along nonmyelinated (unmyelinated) nociceptive fibers (e.g., C-fibers), while pain elicited by intense acute noxious stimuli is transmitted as action potentials along A-delta fibers. In some pain models, such as the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain, injured A-fiber and C-fiber nociceptive terminals undergo plasmalemmal blebbing and swelling, which is consistent with irreversible cell damage occurring in these structures, but little neuroinflammation. Although the mechanisms responsible for such degenerative changes are not fully known, one likely contributor is increased cytoplasmic calcium flux that occurs in neuronal degenerative disease, trauma, and ischemia. In a recent study, activation of a calcium-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptor on spinal nociceptive terminals contributed to the development of mechanical hypersensitivity following spinal nerve ligation, but did not affect the severity of hyperalgesia to an algogen, suggesting that calcium-mediated secondary injury mechanisms influence nociceptive processing only when the nerve is chronically injured. Because the loss of nociceptive input from injured nerves or the use of calcium channel blockers can relieve neuropathic pain and suppress activity of central pain-sensitizing neurons, increased calcium could be a primary initiating event in nerve-injury-induced neural plasticity in both noc",

It is also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.~Studies have shown that hypothyroidism increased the risk of COVID-19 composite poor outcomes. This study also aimed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement therapy was effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of COVID-19, and in improving the severity of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related complications.~Now the question is: Will this patient meet the requirements of the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial?

The study revealed the possibility and expediency of increasing the prognostic accuracy of primary tumor infiltration into the bone marrow by examination of its biopsy material. The value of a bioptic examination of the biopsy material was confirmed by the study of the prognostic parameters of the tumor with the evaluation of the extent of its invasion into the bone marrow and a prognosis of the malignancy based on the biopsy specimen.

Although the negative selection process has been studied for over 30 yr, how this selection is accomplished has been a continuing enigma. The role of HLA-DM in this negative selection process is a contentious issue. Expression of HLA-DM in thymus was initially reported to be undetectable, and several studies argued that HLA-DM is not required for central tolerance. However, we have shown that HLA-DM and MHC class II accumulate in cortex and medulla, respectively, during thymic maturation, suggesting that thymocytes are subject to both the positive and negative selection processes. Surprisingly, transcriptionally regulated expression of HLA-DM in thymus was shown to be low, but detectable. However, expression of HLA-DM in thymus is not low enough to support the theory that DM-DM interactions do not take place during thymic selection process. This review summarizes previously published work including our more recent finding on the expression of HLA-DM and its potential regulation in mouse thymus.<EOD> Hydrogen Peroxide Activation of the Relevant Ion Channels and Receptors under Physiological Conditions\n\nThe primary reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) with iron proteins is well known. However, the peroxide can react with many other molecules or biological structures leading to a modification of their functions. The activation of specific ion channels by H 2 O 2 represents a new mechanism of signaling and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. These channels belong to cationic channels: TRPA1, TRPV1-V4, TRPM2, and TRPV2. In particular, H 2 O 2 activation of the cationic channels TRPA1 and TRPV1-4 is crucial for sensory transduction, cardiac contractility, and cell damage via apoptosis. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 activation of TRPM2 leads to calcium influx, which results in the activation of downstream signal",

Fall frequency ranges from 19% to 66%. The incidence of falls in patients with MS has been reported to occur in up to 66% of MS patients, although this varies widely from person to person. Fear of falling is a significant psychosocial condition that decreased level of physical performance and quality of life in middle-aged and elderly adults, and might be related to falls. A recent study showed that the odds ratio in elderly people was 8.3 (CI 95%), and that falls, in turn, doubled the risk of being overweight and of having hypertension.\nThe most common causes of falls in individuals with MS are loss of balance and muscle weakness. The causes of falls in MS are related to motor disorders, cognitive disability, fatigue, and visual and sensory-motor deficit. Balance in an upright posture is maintained through the integration of visual, muscular, and neuronal proprioceptive information. Muscles involved in balance are the biceps, quadriceps, calf muscles, abdominal muscles, and gluteus medius during weight-bearing exercises; these muscles are very important for balance and gait.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n## Participants\nParticipants were selected based on the criteria previously definedfor the study; all underwent a neurological evaluation based on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and a questionnaire for screening of MS.

The regulation of 15-PGDH expression and function is not known, but we hypothesized that 15-PGDH expression increased during the inflammatory phase of the injury repair and carcinogenesis processes, and decreased during the resolution phase. Our recent study demonstrated inhibition of the mouse 15-PGDH promoter by the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway. In this study, we found that the steroid receptor coactivator 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PPARGC1A) have a positive effect on the mouse 15-PGDH promoter activity. We determined that PPARGC1A mediated the estrogen receptor-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1)-induced transactivation of the 15-PGDH promoter via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We developed a mouse chondrocyte cell line by utilizing the 15-PGDH promoter driven the human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 E7 as an oncogene. The ERR\u03b1-expressing cells had a higher cell survival rate than control cells. We speculate that the reduction of the 15-PGDH levels, and concomitant increase in the PGE2 levels via PPARGC1A and ERR\u03b1, may result in a reduction of the inflammatory response associated with tissue repair and tumor progression.<EOD> Development and Characterization of 3D-Printed Flexible Sensors as High Performance Tools for Intrapartum Electronic Fetal Membrane Rupture Diagnosis",

The trial is looking for patients with cancer. The age factor of patients has the same value for both the first and second conditions. Therefore, since the value of each age factor in the first condition matches the patient note, it is '0' if the clinical trial includes age factor. In the second condition, the values for each age factor are inconsistent with the patient note. Thus this condition is '1' if clinical trial uses age as an inclusion criteria. \n\nExplanation\nThis example shows the difference between positive and negative criteria. The left condition shows the example for positive criteria whereas the right condition shows the example for negative criteria.\n\n## [INST]\nHere is a positive criterion and we have to judge whether the value of a criterion is a match or a mismatch for each patient's value of that criterion. The patient's value of the criterion matches the value of that criterion. Thus this condition is 0 if the clinical trial uses the age factor. \nHere is a negative criterion and we have to determine 0 or 1. The negative criterion has a true value or a false value. The true value matches with the patient's value of the clinical trial's criterion. Otherwise, the false value is mismatched with the patient's value of a criterion. \nTherefore, the output of this task will be `Trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial`.\n\n# Exercise\nTry running this example on Anaconda.\n\n# Exercise\nLet's try running this example on Anaconda.\n\n# TASK 1\nInput a patient note and a trial note: \n- patient-note: ```{\n    'note': \"\\nA 25-year-old woman presents to the clinic\\n\\ncomplaining of prolonged fatigue.

As with the clinical trial eligibility, we define this task as a function of patient as `get_assay_level_eligibility_note(): ` so that you can output the eligibility assessments of a patient for all the clinical trials and finally get the patient_level_eligibility for each patient.\n\nFirst, the assay-level data are needed; therefore, the patients' assay-level data are loaded. We load the data that are contained in the columns `Id`,`assay_ID`,`patient-ID`, and `value` in the `assay_data` data frame. We do not load the columns that are not needed such as `name`(see Code 2, Line 10),which results in speeding up the loading of the data. After loading the assay-level data, you need to define the functions `assay_level_eligibility_notes()` and `patient_level_eligibility()` which should be used to output the assay-level eligibility-assessment and patient-level eligibility. The patient_level_eligibility provides you assay-level eligibilities for each patient. For example, a patient could have assay-level eligibility for some clinical trials but not for others. At a glance, based on the code you can see that the process can be divided into three parts: 1) The load of the clinical trials and assay data including the data frame construction; 2) the definition of the functions `assay_level_eligibility_note()`, `patient_level_eligibility()` and`assay_data.columns()` to output the assay_level and patient_leve eligibility from the data frame columns; and 3) the output of the assay_data.columns and the data frames `clinical_trials` and `patients`.\nFinally, `",

Although bortezomib improves the overall survival of patients with various hematopoietic malignancies, some patients develop resistance and the disease is recurrent in most cases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show promising anticancer effects on malignancies, and the ability of these agents to improve conventional therapies such as bortezomib may serve as an effective strategy for overcoming therapeutic limitations. This study tested combination regimens, using LBH589, on leukemia cell lines representing normal/nonmalignant and malignant cells of all major hematopoietic lineages and on primary leukemia cells. LBH589 plus bortezomib had synergistic cytotoxic effects on both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. LBH589 treatment induced a decrease in the expression of bcl-2, survivin, and xIAP and a simultaneous increase in the expression of death ligands by upregulation of TRAIL and downregulation of cFlip by downregulation of \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. This study demonstrates that LBH589 in combination with bortezomib represents a novel therapeutic strategy against hematopoietic malignancies.<EOD> Role of TP-5 in prevention of the side effects of long-term oral opioid therapy in children and adults.\nThe goal of this prospective, randomized and controlled, open-label, trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose TP-5 in the prevention of constipation and the development of dependence (opioid bowel syndrome) in long-term oral opioid therapy.

In Silico Simulation of the Diffusion of a Nanoparticle in a Membrane. Nanomaterials\n\n# Introduction\nIn the past decades, our understanding of biological systems, as well as their applications in medicine, have been increased with the use of nanoparticles (NPs). These structures include many types of compounds: organic and inorganic material; spherical and cylindrical; biometric and non-biometric shapes; nanowires; nanotubes, nanospheres, etc. Each of these types of compounds includes structures with different sizes and degrees of biocompatibility, which are used to perform specific tasks.\nIn medicine, the main function of nanoparticles is to deliver a specific drug with the highest efficiency. Due to the great size of the NPs in comparison with the cellular structures, NPs have a great advantage in terms of improving solubility and bioavailability, and the stability of the administered drug. The high flexibility and ease of modification are also attractive features in the field of drug design . These NPs can also target specific cellular markers on tumor cells, allowing selective intracellular delivery of the drug and avoiding harmful effects on healthy cells. Another type of nanoparticle is the organic liposome. These NPs are used in the transport of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules due to their structure [bib_ref]  Nanoparticle delivery of cancer drugs, Wang [/bib_ref] .\nNanoparticles have many functions and applications in daily life.

OTEIS is used for collecting and organizing a variety of trial-related information, ranging from demographic details to information about adverse events that may develop in patients during and after taking a drug.\nOTEIS has six categories of data:\nSubject demographic\nBaseline data\nDrug administrations\nInvestigator assessments\nMedical events\nSafety events\nYou are called by the new site coordinator to help them prepare for the first session of training. The coordinator explains that she has been through the basics of operating OTEIS and has been taught by the data manager, a pharmacist with many years of experience. When the coordinator talks with you, she tells you that the data manager said it was very important to ensure that the computer did not have too many errors for patient data entry so they could get into the habit of double-checking patient data before the trial starts. The coordinator is especially concerned about the number of data entry errors that the data manager said they encountered, and so you need to figure out a suitable approach to helping her avoid entering incorrect data into OTEIS. \n       \nA site coordinator is required to input eligible subjects into the system, by manually entering their study ID into the OTEIS system and then selecting all the appropriate demographic information. The coordinator needs to enter certain subjects' medications and any adverse events, and then double-check the information. OTEIS uses a barcode scanner to link electronic data with data on paper. The coordinator needs to scan a bar code and enter information on paper for all subjects. When entering the data, the coordinator can make a final review of everything that has been entered to date to see if anyone",

What should you do to improve the proportion of eligible patients?\nYou should develop a strategy to improve this problem. You should consider the number of potentially eligible patients, the number of eligible patients on entering the trial, and the number of patients participating in the trial. Let's begin.\n\nThere are 1000 patients attending the clinics of your clinical trial sponsor, including 350 patients attending your clinic. Among these patients, 200 patients are eligible according to the trial's eligibility criteria. Among them, 1 out of every 10 eligible patients participates in the clinical trial. The other 9/10 eligible patients do not participate due to several factors. We discuss two of these factors.\n\nYou plan to study the following two factors:\n\n### Factor A\n\nThis factor is related to an adverse event, such as a patient's hospital stay. If the stay is longer than the standard admission time, the patient cannot be recruited into the trial. This factor is called a trial-specific eligibility factor.\n\n### Factor B\n\nThis factor is related to the trial. This factor is called a clinic-specific eligibility factor.\n\nYour sponsor wants to improve the trial enrollment rate. What should you, as an employee of the clinic, propose to increase the rate of eligible patients who complete the clinical trial?\n    * First, develop a strategy based only on Factor A.\n\n[INST] You should consider the number of potentially eligible patients, the number of eligible patients on entering the trial, and the number of patients participating in the trial. This is similar to the question you were just asked.\n\nYou think that some of the eligible patients cannot participate in the trial because of extra costs incurred between the clinical trial and their admission time.

In addition, datasets are provided to support reproducibility.\n\n## Benchmarking data set\nTo benchmark [2,16] a range of techniques, an original synthetic data set is designed. Each sample is generated by a generative process that depends on the chosen model. The design of the dataset is inspired by the real problems of this article and the use case data set of [2,16], but contains no private or sensitive human data. The data set is provided as `Example_dataset.txt` in the [data folder](https://github.com/zhangjianqiang/clinical-trial-eligibility-assessment/tree/main/data).

First, a data set of 500 samples is initialized with synthetic random seeds. Sequences containing 3 variables are generated for two datasets (patients and study). The generator of the first dataset (patient data) assigns variables between 0 and 1 (12 variables) and the generator of the second dataset (study data) assigns variables between 0 and 130 (6 variables) with 87 as the mean. A uniform distribution is generated uniformly for all variables in the first dataset and the normal distribution is generated for variables from 50 to 500 in the second dataset. After that, the generator generates categorical variables by randomly selecting values from set variables. For example, variables 32 and 266 are generated to variables 1 and 0, respectively, and thus the categorical variables have a frequency of 1. Similarly, the generative data set is extended to 200 samples by the same process, and a second random seed is provided.\n\n\n```r\ndatGen <- function(seed){\n  d <- rep(NA, n = 500)\n  d[1:12] <- rnorm(1",

The COVID-19 disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since become a major outbreak on a global scale, leading to an official announcement of the new pandemic and a name of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The most common symptoms in infected cases are similar to those in patients with seasonal flu such as dry cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. However, since the COVID-19 disease is newly found in humans without any previous exposure to the virus, it is still not known why the virus causes severe life-threating pneumonia in some patients and not in others, and what are the major risk factors for being infected. Since it was not possible to collect lung biopsies in living patients, a series of public collections of high-resolution CT (HRCT) images were released in the framework of the COVID-19 Radiography Synthesis and Evaluation (CoRaSE), a part of the COVID-19 CLEAR initiative by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The goal of the CoRaSE challenge and this task is to automate the evaluation and scoring of COVID-19 disease severity based on the HRCT scan.  This task contains two sub-tasks: assessment of CORADS scores (CoRADS) and severity scores (CADSS) for each patient. CORADS scores are defined based on radiologic findings. Specifically, a chest radiograph is evaluated by the following three-digit scoring system: (1) COMMUNICATION (CO) refers to presence of a clear, easily recognizable, and definite pattern, mostly pneumonia on the radiographs.

Oxytocin is the most common uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recently recommended a single 100mcg dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent post partum hemorrhage (PPH), in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of carbetocin has not yet been published. The investigators hypothesize that the minimum effective dose (ED90) is above 20mcgs and below 80mcgs in women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAll patients planned for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.\nAll patients who give written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level elig",

At present the standard care of hospitalized children with bronchiolitis is oxygen via nasal prongs. In this study the investigators would like to compare standard ward management with a new method of delivering oxygen called high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNOT). HFNOT involves breathing warmed, moistened oxygen through nasal cannulae at a flow rate of 8 liters/minute.

Eight tests were considered: 1. Clinical history (70 cases). 2. Clinical acuity (70 cases). 3. Clinical visual acuity (80 cases). 4. Colour discrimination (45 cases). 5. Vision field defects (71 cases). 6. Accommo-dation (40 cases). 7. Objective refraction (30 patients). 8. Retinoscopy (30 patients). The tests gave fair to good reliability coefficients except in the case of the refraction tests which may have given better reliability but were considered unsuitable. For the nonmedical group the average reliability coefficient was 0.7 for medical graduates, 0.4 for science graduates and 0.6 for science graduates with prior experience of ophthalmology. The average reliability coefficient for ophthalmologists after 5 tests had been done was 0.8. There was no consistent correlation between tests in groups of cases. There was good agreement between the scores given by medical graduates of different types of course in 2 out of 8 tests. In the other 6 the differences were not considered significant. There was no evidence that the average ophthalmologist had a better score than the various groups of test takers. It was concluded that: 1. Scores on the tests used showed the same tendency to disagreement as those found in other studies, and, that there was no good evidence of an improvement in the results with experience. Therefore, there was no reliable evidence of a correlation between scores and ability or lack of ability on the test. 2. Although the test results could be improved by giving preliminary training, it was not found possible to devise a valid and reliable score. Therefore, the tests did not appear to be satisfactory instruments for pre-registration evaluation or selection of students for pre-registration work. 3",

Although pulmonary disease may develop in patients with CLL, it is a rare complication of the disease and is often overlooked. In addition, pulmonary complications may occur in the absence of classical B cell lymphocytosis. We present here a rare case of a 64year-old female patient with a 1-year history of non-productive cough, fatigue and decreased exercise capacity. A chest radiograph was compatible with a multifocal pneumonia. A lung biopsy was performed to investigate the cause of these symptoms; no classical histological features of CLL could be identified on the biopsy. CLL was finally diagnosed after positive B-lymphocyte immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first case of atypical pulmonary involvement of CLL diagnosed by histopathological demonstration of lymphocyte infiltration in the lung parenchyma and its successful treatment by rituximab.\n\n# Background\nChronic lymphocyt",

It was prepared because of widespread interest in the postoperative metabolic complications of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB). However, the literature on this subject is full of confusing and conflicting results, some of which are reviewed. Our own data have resulted from a randomized study of 20 patients with severe mitral insufficiency who were operated on with or without CPB between 1964 and 1969. The first three patients (all without CPB) were followed clinically and metabolically on a number of occasions postoperatively; the other 17 patients were followed similarly (for a shorter time) postoperatively, but without being given any special diet or drugs. The serum glucose values and the urinary excretion of glucose and 17-ketosteroids are analysed after recovery from surgery and up to the 7th postoperative day. The results show that in both groups of patients there is a postoperative hyperglycaemia which recovers only slowly after about 3 days. Postoperatively, the patients without bypass have a higher urinary excretion of glucose and the glucose concentration is higher in their urine. The postoperative results of these patients are not due to the surgical stress alone, but are connected with the nutritional aspect of the CPB group and the more severe operative trauma in the open group.

The rash was pruritic, and he was initially treated with clindamycin. However, the lesions persisted and new lesions subsequently developed over his back. In addition to the pigmented lesions, the patient complained of hair loss, which the dermatologist suspected was telogen effluvium. He was treated with steroids at his dermatologist's request, but the rash persisted.\nPhysical examination revealed well-demarcated areas of discrete hyperpigmentation, ranging from 2 to 3 cm in diameter, on the patient's cheeks, forehead, and back . Dermoscopy showed a network of white lines. Histopathology from the back showed an increased number of Langerhans cells, consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The results of biopsies from his cheek and forehead also revealed LCH and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. The number of melanophages was also decreased in the patient's skin biopsy specimen. The patient did not have a familial history of similar pigmentary abnormalities. He denied experiencing any additional symptoms, including fever, weight loss, diarrhea, cough, or fatigue.\n\n# Discussion\nOur patient presented with hyperpigmented lesions and hair loss. Based on our biopsy results, he was diagnosed with LCH. LCH is a rare oral pathology that can affect the",

In particular, information on age and gender, as well as the exact date of injury, was requested from the mentioned data sets (Figure 1).

This was evident in the univariate analysis (i.e., without adjustment; p = 0.009). The proportion increased from the 1st to the 2nd course and then decreased to a lower level. The 1st course also took place in significantly less time, i.e., more frequently during the winter months, compared to the 2nd and 3rd courses. There was no evidence that the time of the injury increased between course repetitions. In a follow-up model including the duration of the ski course, the proportions by course repetition remained unchanged (Model 1). However, the duration of the ski course did not change the proportion over time, i.e., from the 1st to the 2nd and to the 3rd course repetitions.\nThe age of the participants was significantly younger in the 1st course than in the courses repeated 2 and 3 times.

However, the effect of postoperative lymphocyte immune response on prognosis has not been adequately examined. Therefore, we investigated the effect of lymphopenia and prophylactic abdominal binder wearing on postoperative immunological function and prognosis. Methods: This retrospective study investigated 80 patients who underwent open pancreaticoduodenectomy in the pancreatic surgery clinic of the authors and were diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma. Lymphocyte and neutrophil counts within 24 h after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy were examined for all the 80 patients. Results: Postoperative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were significantly lower than preoperative values. The proportion of patients with lymphocyte counts<1200/\u03bcL was 52.5% at 0 -6 h, 20% at 6 -12 h, and 10% at 12 -24 h after the operation; the median time of onset for lymphopenia was 12 h. Patients with preoperative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts 1200/\u03bcL or higher had significantly lower lymphocyte and neutrophil counts after surgery than the other patients. Moreover, the time to occurrence of lymphopenia or neutropenia was significantly longer in the former than the latter, suggesting that patients with lower neutrophil and lymphocyte counts preoperatively had better postoperative immune function than the other patients.

While IgE molecules are essential for these reactions, the function of IgG in allergic reactions remains unknown. The IgG immune response is essential for the allergic reaction, even when IgE is not present. Allergic reactions would not likely occur if IgG synthesis were completely suppressed.

Here, we investigated the effect of bovine interleukin-4 (bIL-4) on the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and expression of adhesion molecule CD44 and CD62L in PBLC derived from bovine tuberculosis (bTB) cows. BALB/c mice were divided into control and infection groups (10 each group). In the control group, no Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) was added, but in the infection group, M. bovis H153 was inoculated under intraperitoneal conditions. After 8, 16, and 24 weeks, blood was collected from the tail vein, and PBMC was isolated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in the serum of bTB mice after 24 weeks of inoculation showed a significant difference. PBLC from bTB mice after 24 weeks of inoculation produced significantly more IL-8 and significantly lower frequencies of CD44 + CD4 + CD7 + , CD44 + CD4 + CD7 \u2212 , CD62L + CD4 + CD7 + , and CD62L + CD4 + CD7 \u2212 lymphocytes than bactin or PBS groups.

HPV infections have been shown to increase HSPs expression and stabilize several oncogenic proteins; however, the direct effects of HPV E6 oncoproteins on HSF1\u2010regulated HSPs are not well understood yet. Here we investigated the effects of HPV\u201018 E6 on HSF1 activation and cell stress survival by modulating the transcription of HSPs. We stably transduced Hela and SiHa cells with a lentiviral vector expressing the E6 protein. The E6 oncogene significantly affected the expression of HSF1 proteins and their upstream\u2010activated factors, including HSF\u20101, HEAT SHOCK FACTOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2A (HSF2A) and 2B (HSF2B). In addition, overexpression of E6 oncoprotein was shown to promote the survival and invasion of malignant cervical cancer cells under heat shock and hypoxic stress. The E6 oncoprotein also upregulated Hsp70, Hsp90\u03b1 and Hsp90\u03b2 at mRNA and protein levels in HeLa and SiHa cells, providing evidence of E6\u2010mediated induction of cellular heat shock response. E6 inhibition decreases HSF1 expression, resulting in decreased cell invasion in vitro, as well as inhibition of tumor formation and invasion in a cervical cancer mouse model. Finally, our study showed that HSF1 expression correlated with that of its downstream target HSP70 in cervical tumors. Our work reveals a new mechanism between HPV oncoproteins and HSF1, providing clues to potential therapeutic targets to combat HPV\u2010related diseases.<EOD> Fatigue during spaceflight, part II: microgravitational effects on human performance.\nThe purpose of this second report of the Space Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI",

It is well documented that an angiogenic potential may be a biologically important difference of the seminal plasma (SP) between normospermic (NS) and oligospermic (OS) men. Our knowledge of the complex mechanisms regulating spermatogenesis and the reproductive processes is limited. Angiogenesis occurs not only in tissues of the female reproductive tract, but also in those of the male reproductive system (2). Infertility can be caused by poor spermatogenesis, abnormal sperm function, aberrant interaction between spermatozoa and oocytes, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine factor, uterine fibroids, and pelvic congestion syndrome (PGS). PGS is classified into 4 types according to the etiology (myomas, varicoceles, adenomyosis, lymphocoele). PGS contributes to male fertility problems, such as erectile dysfunction, chronic prostatitis, varicocelectomy, sperm retrieval, and the decreased fertilization rates, as well as increases the miscarriage rate. Recent studies have shown that the expression of some vascular growth factors and their receptors in the testicular vein of infertile men is associated with lower sperm counts, abnormal sperm morphologies, and increased concentrations of FSH, and the hormonal profile of the patients can be improved by varicolectomy (3). Moreover, varicoele is the most frequent pathologic condition associated with male infertility (4). The main symptoms are bilateral, but the left testicular vein is more affected by venous reflux than the right one. Although a considerable portion of infertile men with varicocele and unexplained infertility exhibit impaired spermatogenesis and defects in sperm maturation and motility, little is known about the molecular mechanisms linking",

Maastricht\nT he prevalence of overweight children in the Netherlands is higher than that reported elsewhere in Western Europe. It is unclear what factors may influence or explain this seemingly paradoxical observation. However, this trend in recent years appears to correspond with the increased immigration to the Netherlands, as demonstrated by Statistics Netherlands .\nAn article in this journal and in The Lancet points to the potential influence of the increased consumption of high-caloric and energy-dense types of foods in addition to the decreased level of physical activity being undertaken by children. 1,2 To test this hypothesis, we determined the prevalence of overweight and obesity among two subpopulations of the Dutch population -Dutch-speaking children and children from immigrants, defined by the parents' country of birth.\nThis analysis was based on data collected as part of the study \"Preventing overweight in preschool children: a randomized controlled trial,\" ongoing at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. In the study, 690 4-year-old children living in the region of Amsterdam, who visited the outpatient division of the academic department of pediatrics from September 2004 to October 2006, were randomly assigned to intervention groups focused on prevention of overweight. Parents were interviewed after the routine visit about whether the child was of Dutch origin or a child of immigrants.\nThe children came for the initial visit at age 4 with no recent symptoms or conditions, and only a minority (127 [or 18%]) had been seen by a physician in a preceding year. Weight and height measurements were then taken, following which parents completed a questionnaire. Children were classified into three groups depending on the body mass index (i.e., weight in kilograms divided by the square of body height in metres). The three groups were normal (between the 10th and 85th centiles), overweight/obese (\u2265 85th centile) and underweight (< 10th centile).\nAnthropometric measurements of weight and height were recorded to the",

The family of type-B response regulators (RRs) is encoded by one gene class of the family of G-protein signaling pathways in Arabidopsis. Despite a high degree of similarity among RR proteins, they play distinct regulatory roles and have different subcellular localizations. Here, we describe the expression and function of RR4 (GmRR4), a type-B RR gene from soybean. RR4 is constitutively expressed in various plant organs, including roots and stems upon abiotic stress conditions; its mRNA steadily accumulates in a wide range of plant tissues and also in leaves after dehydration. Transgenic Soybean overexpressing gmRR4 has enhanced root biomass and aphid resistance, and was sensitive to the salt stress. RR4 was targeted to the nucleus under nonstress conditions, which was altered to enrich in the cytoplasm under abiotic stress conditions. This change is consistent with the finding that RR4 functions in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus. These observations indicate that RR4 participates in various abiotic stress responses including biotic stress and provides new insights about RR4 and G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in plants.<EOD> A comparative study of the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine and thiamazole using different rat models.\nThis study was designed to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine with that of thiamazole in rat adjuvant arthritis, carrageenin edema, dextran edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation models.

This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of trauma center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high mortality is attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly, cardiac disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although beta-blockade has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for myocardial infarction after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential underlying cardiac disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine administration of beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.\nThis study is a",

Distraction and osteotomy were performed over either the medial or the lateral tibia. The patients were assessed by the modified Maryland Foot Score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ankles were assessed by the Orthopaedic Research Institute Ankle Score. The average patient age at the time of the procedure was thirty-seven years, and the average follow-up period was four years. The average increase in the medial clear space was 5.3 mm, from 3.5 mm to 8.8 mm; the average increase in the lateral clear space was 6.3 mm, from 4.9 mm to 11.2 mm. No patients developed avascular necrosis or had loss of bone from the distraction zone, which was not covered by articular cartilage. All except one patient had a good result. The average preoperative score of forty-three points increased to seventy-nine points; in some patients the final score improved above the average points received by a normal foot in a healthy individual (ninety-two points).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnkle distraction arthroplasty is a useful technique for restoring the articular surface on the talar dome in osteochondral defects, and allows an effective reduction of congruency in the sagittal and mortise views of the ankle.<EOD> High-resolution 3D surface topography reconstruction using confocal laser scanning microscopy and computational geometry.\nA reconstruction method for rebuilding a three dimensional surface topography image from two-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) data is proposed for micro-",

POCS monolayer can be used as the template to synthesize mesoporous titania because of its hierarchical nano- and microstructure. The synthesis is very simple, reliable, and cost-effective, and titania can be uniformly grown on fabrics without any treatment, which is very beneficial to the applications of fabrics. The effects of pH value, the dosage of POCS, and titania on the morphologies, pore structure, properties, and photocatalytic activities of the film were investigated. The characterization results show that the hierarchical mesostructured titania film uniformly coats the fabrics, with an extremely large surface area of 121.06 m2 g(-1) and pore volume of 0.3600 cm3 g(-1). The titania film exhibits excellent dye adsorption for colorants (MB and RhB), and the adsorption capacity of 20 min is 1.67 mg g(-1) for RhB and 1.11 mg g(-1) for MB dye. It also exhibits good photocatalytic activity for the inactivation of E. coli (at least 80% in 30 min).<EOD> Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction\n\nBackground: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decrease in acute healthcare utilization has been reported for both cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases.

        "output": "<EOD> Association of Sensate Dural Layers With Pterygopalatine Artery: An Anatomical Observation\nBackgroundThe pterygopalatine artery (PPA) is vital for preservation of the blood supply of the brain. The dura mater (DM) of the midbrain is intimately connected to the PPA and therefore is exposed to its high risk of occlusion. These 2 structures can be directly connected during skull base approaches in cases of extensive dural retraction. We aimed to investigate the possibility of developing an alternative route for the preservation of the blood supply of the brain in such cases. MethodsWe dissected 15 formalin-fixed specimens of the pterygopalatine region by using the modified Kerkhoff technique to identify the DM. The relationships between the dural folds and the PPA were analyzed. ResultsWe obtained 2 new findings in these specimens. First, the PPA was found in the DM in 10 (67%) specimens. Most of these PPAs entered through the roof of the infratemporal fossa through the greater petrosal nerve, or through an intradural route, in the midbrain region. The DM contained several sensate folds. Some sensate DM was connected with the PPA, and some PPAs were located behind the DM. Some of these PPAs passed through the sensate DM, which had sensation on the PPA. ConclusionsWe reported a surgically significant and easily recognizable variation of the PPA located in or behind the DM in the midbrain region and communicating with the PPA. This variation may help preservation of the blood supply to the brain in cases of surgical insult to the DM.<EOD> Invasive Hemophilus influenzae infections in adults.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation is a potent initiator of NE differentiation and a prognostic marker of disease progression. Here, we show that AhR activation induces NE differentiation in the androgen-independent PC cell line DU145 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that AhR activation reduces androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity upon androgen treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that the NE phenotype is enhanced in patient-derived tumors with a reduced AR expression compared to AR-positive tumors upon AhR activation. Thus, our results show that the integration of external and intrinsic information, such as androgens and proliferative signals, regulates AR expression and is essential to initiate NE differentiation. We propose that AhR activation in patients with PC who have reduced AR expression could be an efficient therapeutic strategy to reduce growth of NE tumor cells and, consequently, reduce proliferation and tumor burden.<EOD> Effective drug intervention for patients with alcoholism and antisocial disorder.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe authors examined whether the benefits of acamprosate (a drug that has produced encouraging results in trials of patients with alcoholics who continue to abuse alcohol) can be extended to patients with alcoholism who also have antisocial or borderline personality disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors treated an open sample of 39 alcoholic patients with comorbid antisocial disorder with daily doses of up to 600 mg of acamprosate.

Patients in the nonoperative group will be place in a sling for two weeks and then allowed to mobilise under supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. For those patients in the operative group, tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their supervising consultant.

In this study, the effects of addition of EGF or TGF-\u03b1 to chemically-defined medium were investigated. As a result, the effect of adding TGF-\u03b1 to the medium in the form of BM-derived osteoblasts (BMBOs) was shown to be more pronounced than that of adding EGF. When compared with the control, addition of 20 ng/mL TGF-\u03b1 to a BMBO-conditioned medium resulted in a 39% increase in the progenitor cell number after 24 hours. When grown in the media supplemented by 20 ng/mL EGF, the cell number showed no significant increase compared to that in the control (P < .05). In conclusion, TGF-\u03b1 is better than EGF in the stimulation of porcine BM progenitor cells, and the present study provides evidence that TGF-\u03b1 might be used to supplement chemically-defined medium in vitro.<EOD> The effect of a pharmacist intervention on healthcare costs in asthma at primary care level.\nAIM\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of the clinical pharmacist's intervention on costs associated with asthma treated at primary care level.\n\n\nDESIGN OF THE STUDY\nThe case-control design was used.\n\n\nMETHOD\nPatients were recruited from 14 primary care clinics.

The uptake of ACS from the lung and the cerebral uptake of carbon dioxide were measured directly, as were blood flow and arteriovenous differences for blood-borne ACA in the brain (arterial minus venous ACA concentrations). Following intake of ACS, the cerebral uptake of carbon dioxide declined. While pentobarbitone alone had little influence on the intake of ACS from the lung, the cerebral ACA accumulation and the cerebral uptake of ACS depended on the type of anaesthetic. The use of sevoflurane, isoflurane, halothane and methoxyflurane decreased the uptakes of ACS from the lung and carbon dioxide, and increased the intracarotid-intracerebral (i.c.-i.c.) difference. These differences increased, however, in the presence of diethyl ether. Enflurane and halothane decreased the cerebral ACA accumulation, but enflurane increased the cerebral blood flow.

Six different sugars were used, and the tolerance curves were similar in respect of time to peak rise and total amount of carbohydrate being absorbed but they differed greatly in the amount of carbohydrate absorbed. There was a great degree of overlapping between glucose and the other sugars, a phenomenon shown also for glucose and lactose and to a lesser extent for glucose and galactose but not for glucose and maltose. This overlap was considered to be due partly to the small amount of carbohydrate given and partly to the relatively unreleased glucose being available to the rest of the animal (as it is in the dog). A series of tests, in which either glucose or maltose was given, showed a high incidence (over 80",

The reasons for designating the parasitic nematodes as biological invasives are the ability to rapidly invade new habitats, adapt quickly to new hosts, and spread very quickly, often at a global scale.\nDespite being recognized as invasive species, the term 'invasive nematodes' mainly refers to free-living nematodes [bib_ref]  A review of nematodes that have been reported mainly in wildlife, with..., Cutmore [/bib_ref] .

The AHC approach consists of data analysis by multivariate statistical methods in three steps, using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms. Since AHC does not use any statistical method explicitly designed to identify haplotypes, we have used the software to cluster the DNA microarray samples and the subsequent application of several algorithms designed to detect haplotypes. Since each of these haplotype detection programs uses a different approach to identify haplotypes we can use this method to compare the approaches of the different softwares. The results show that in cases where all samples belong to one group, the use of AHC with the PCA algorithm for the analysis gives better results in the discrimination of haplotypes than the combination of the different haplotype detection softwares.<EOD> Reconstruction of the mandible with interpositional osteonecrosis graft associated with maxillary and mandibular osteosynthesis and titanium plates.

There are many types of glycosylation disorder classifications that have been proposed, many of them involving overlapping groups of symptoms and diagnoses. CDGs can be classified by glycan type; glycoenzymatic pathway; type of protein to which the carbohydrate chains will bind, resulting in 13 different CDGs; CDG families by shared features of certain mutations; or a combination of the last two. Case Presentation:A 16-month-old female presented with a history of multiple admissions from recurrent episodes of vomiting and respiratory distress. The patient had numerous diagnoses, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, apnea of prematurity, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delay. The medical history was also complicated by chronic seizures, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections requiring multiple rounds of antibiotics. The patient had a number of other systemic complications, including pustular scars on the trunk, a hypotonic upper extremity, strabismus, and a delayed speech pattern. A genetic mutation in UDP-Glucose Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase(UGGT) was discovered. Conclusion: This case report indicates that CDG with a genetic mutation in SLC35A2 may cause symptoms including developmental delay, recurrent severe vomiting, and chronic lung disease.\nCongenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of genetic defects that present with a wide range of possible symptoms and diagnoses. CDGs have been reported as causing developmental delays, psychiatric disorders, seizures, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, failure to thrive, visual problems, renal and liver disease, autoimmune disorders, and respiratory issues such as pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.CDGs",

In addition to the role of the central nervous system, the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of salt and water homeostasis, renin secretion and vascular tone. The central nervous system can excite the sympathetic outflow to the adrenal medulla (AM), where catecholamines are synthesized and stored. On the other side, there is also an ascending sympathetic influence on the AM, leading to the enhanced catecholamine release. The AM is the principal source of circulating catecholamines, noradrenaline (NA) being the major NA stored and secreted from this organ. Although previous studies demonstrate that NA itself exhibits hypotensive effects, there are also reports showing that the AM is a site of amplified blood pressure response during AH. Recent studies have shown that sympathetic activity targeted to the AM is enhanced in patients with essential AH as well as in AH associated with renovascular atherosclerosis (RMAH) and pheochromocytoma. Thus, one might suggest that the AM plays a role in the pathophysiology of AH.\n\n# Introduction\nThe prevalence of arterial hypertension (AH) as a global public health issue has been estimated to be about 1.13 billion persons, which accounts for around a third of the global burden of disease.

To do this, use backtrack command, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform \\\n      [pwd] \\\n      clinical_trial/note.txt\\\n      patients/data/[patient_id].txt\\\n      -type \"S\" -o patients`. Next, you can use the command to compare the text in the first column of the text file and first two sentences in the patient note, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform [pwd] -type \"F\" -o patients `. Or, you can use the command to find the number of characters in the first column, e.g.,\n`python src/evaluate.py backtrack -type \"W\" -o patients`. The command will generate a new file named `patients.txt`. The column \"W(total_word_count)\" contains the number of words in each sentence as follows: `15`. You can find which two sentences are compared by looking at the first line of patients.txt, `Trial-level eligibility: 0). You can view the entire output, e.g., `./evaluate.py backtrack -inform [pwd] -type \"F\" -o patients`.

Some overlap of disease presentation is probably explained by a high proportion of coinfected individuals with chronic hepatitis or advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis related to HCV infection. Others may be due to the fact that HCV may alter aspects of immune status, and HIV replication. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the potential neurotoxicity induced by antiretroviral drugs, a risk that has only recently been considered, as data on the role of HIV protease inhibitor agents, for example, in neurotoxicity are currently scarce.<EOD> .\nThe article is based on the experience with a single-centre surgical treatment of 210 patients who were operated on for pericarditis complicated by constrictive changes in the pericardial cavity.

Methods The classification criteria and categories defined by a clinical decision support system applied on vascular interventions were classified into eight categories: Medical Prescription, Antibiotic Prescription, Cardiac Arrhythmia, Electrolyte Disorder, Renal Insufficiency, Neurological Disorder, Patient's Characteristics, and Drug Interaction. Each category was subdivided into subcategories. A standardized medical taxonomy was used as the structure to build the classification hierarchy. Results The hierarchy has a total of thirty-three sub-categories. It enables the clinical decision support system to create notifications, based on information extracted from clinical patient records. The application can then issue alerts, warnings, or reminders to a health care provider, or it may require intervention of a health services management team. Conclusion A classification system with defined criteria was designed, that enabled the generation of clinical decision support notifications. The system was tested for the alert generation of a clinical decision support system applied on vascular interventions and has shown to work efficiently.Key PointsThis paper presents a structured methodology, using a medical taxonomy for clinical decision support criteria classification, applied to vascular interventions.The proposed methodology has enabled to create a hierarchy structure with clear definitions to classify clinical decision support criteria.\n\n# Introduction\nElectronic health records (EHR) were introduced to increase the efficiency of health care delivery, as EHR can be retrieved from virtually anywhere, and patients' information is available instantly to different care providers.

We used the following assessment instruments: Barthel test, mini-mental state examination, and the dementia scale of dementias questionnaire (SDDQ). We collected socio-demographic data on the patients and caregivers, and we evaluated the quality of life of the patient (measured with the SDDQ), caregivers, and the type of dementia.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND PROCEDURES\nWe applied the quality of life questionnaire to the patients and to the patient's family caregiver (SDDQ). We collected all necessary demographic data and assessed the patients with the following tests: mini-mental state examination and Barthel index. These data were compared with and without pharmacological therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe type of dementia of the patients was most frequently vascular dementias (26%) and frontotemporal dementias (24%). The mean Barthel score was 82+/-25 and the mean mini-mental state examination score was 12+/-5.3, which implies that the patients had a low degree of dependence and a non-cognitive altered state of consciousness.

Recent findings In the last year, several risk factors were identified as associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. These include: nulliparous and advanced maternal age, and pregestational diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, chronic kidney disease, anaemia, and malaria. In the context of nutrition related risk factors, vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency with reduced iron status are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (PTB). The potential importance of maternal immunization was recognized, and recent data showed the effects of maternal influenza vaccination on PTB and low birth weight (LBW) in Africa. In addition, new screening tests to detect high and low LBW at risk and prevent PTB were suggested. Summary The identification of risk factors has a crucial role in the assessment and management of pregnant women and their offspring, and in preventing adverse outcomes. Health care should be delivered in accordance with each woman's individual needs, which should be reflected in routine maternal and perinatal surveillance programs, using a risk stratification approach. New strategies for treatment and prevention of complications are needed because risk factors associated with malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.<EOD> The relationship between age, sex, and renal stone disease.

Activation of CD8+ T cells is a complex process influenced by diverse cytokines and chemokines. In the current study we assess the role of NK and NKT cells in this process. The authors demonstrate that CpG, a CpG\u2010containing immunostimulatory DNA oligonucleotide, is capable of triggering significant activation of CD8+ T cells in the absence of both NK and NKT cells.

        "output": "<EOD> Nucleic Acids Research\n\nIn this paper we present four new methods for sequencing nucleotide sequences using restriction fragments of DNA or synthetic oligomers containing a single central base; these methods are based on primer extension using a radioactive 18-mer (0.2 pmol) or enzymatic incorporation of dideoxy termination products (12 pmol), and on thermal denaturation of a specific primer in the presence of denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in comparison with those of the original dideoxy termination method of Maxam and Gilbert.\n\n# Introduction\nThe term \"primed sequencing\" was introduced in 1976 for DNA sequencing methods involving the hybridization of a short DNA fragment containing a primer (primed region) to a longer nucleic acid fragment, which is then elongated, releasing the primed region for subsequent hybridization with a radioactive labeled primer. After a great variety of protocols has been established for DNA sequencing, we have reconsidered the application of the primer extension method to dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing (1) and found two important new advantages over the earlier method (2) of sequence analysis. First, the new method, using a specific primer (3) is easier to use in a routine sequencing laboratory than the dideoxy method involving the selection of a random primer. Second, the new sequencing procedure yields reliable and reproducible results as well as the original one.\nThere are two advantages of specific primers for sequencing. First, they lead to high fidelity in DNA sequencing, yielding a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 40:1 (4), which greatly facilitates manual signal identification at low-background densities, such as are easily achieved without problems with the synthetic substrate . Second, the use of a specific primer simplifies the purification of radiolabeled primed fragments in dideoxy sequencing. The specific primer is used to remove the end-labeled restriction fragment by annealing and extension followed by size-fractionation on the gel. Using the specific primer, one can distinguish the two overlapping 32P-labeled fragments in the sequencing reaction as easily as at least a",

Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus, infecting, annually, over 70 million people in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. There is an urgent need for novel chemical control strategies against this mosquito. We have shown that one promising candidate for such a novel control is an experimental triazolide-class juvenile hormone mimics, IKM72. Using a series of bioassays (LC50, LC90, WHO standardization assay) we have demonstrated, for the first time, that IKM72 exhibits high adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. Further, through a histological study via scanning electron microscope, we have explored the mechanism of IKM72 action. IKM72 induces malformation and collapse of adult mosquito ovaries. We found that exposure of Ae. aegypti to IKM72 at LC50 concentration for 24\u2009h also induces apoptosis through activation of caspase 3 protein and de",

Findings\n\n[NAME]\n\nI feel the following findings/differences are relevant.\n\nFindings/Differences\n\n### Diagnosis/Eligibility\n\nThe patient notes, i.e., the first 3 paragraphs as shown in [INST#.1]:\nA 28-year-old female with neck and shoulder pain and left hand and arm paresthesias three weeks after returning from a trip to California where she attended a stray animal recovery campaign. Her physical exam was unremarkable except for slight tremors and almost imperceptible spasticity. She was prescribed NSAIDS and a topical muscle relaxant. She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficultly swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n\nHere is the clinical trial:\nTitle: Octanol to Treat Essential Tremor\n\nSummary: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 1-octanol, a substance similar to alcohol but less intoxicating, for treating essential tremor. Essential tremor is an involuntary shaking, usually of the hands, for which there is no satisfactory treatment. It affects about 1.4 percent of the general U.S. population, with the figure climbing to nearly 4 percent among people over 40. Results of two previous NIH studies have shown 1-octanol to be promising as a potential new treatment. This study will test the effectiveness of 1-octanol on essential tremor at doses lower than those given previously.\n\nPatients 21 years old and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this study. Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two treatment periods of 1 week each, with a 1-week break at home between treatments. Before beginning treatment, participants undergo a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition, tremors are measured using accelerometry, a procedure in which a small device, mounted on a piece of cardboard, is taped to the patient's hand for about 30",

People with tobacco use disorders have high stress levels and increased cravings for nicotine during stressful periods in their lives.~Smokers in smoke-free hospital settings, like those admitted to the hospital with a recent tobacco-related illness, are likely to be motivated to stop using tobacco products. Given this setting, nicotine deprivation can be used to induce unpleasant smoking cessation",

The four DONT derivatives were docked to a common template comprised of the N-terminal region of the human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). A comparison of binding affinities of CP178, EA150, DA150 and TE150 for DONT in an aqueous environment at several temperatures is presented. This comparison is based upon the Gibbs free energy difference between DONT in water and DONT in the AACl template (GDD). In a previous experimental paper, we proposed that the hydrophobic effects at the interface of the two recognition moieties and the amino acids were the main contributors to the interaction between HCA II and DONT. In this theoretical study, the interaction between the recognition moiety and the amino acids are attributed to the stabilization of the binding of DONT to the template and the interaction between the two recognition moiety. In addition, the interaction between the AACl templates and DONT is shown to depend upon the size of the template cavity, as well as its hydrophobicity. It is predicted that a template with a large cavity size, such as TE150, would interact more weakly with DONT as compared to a template with a cavity size closer to the HCA II size, such as EA150. These results are in agreement with experimental study which shows that the amino acids functionalized with a large-sized cleft are better able to selectively bind the DONT derivatives than the templates functionalized with small-sized clefts.<EOD> Diversity and distribution",

A theoretical model based on the Maxwell and Gibbs equations is proposed in order to describe the osmotic pressure jump. The maximum shrinking velocity is determined quantitatively with a model that involves the diffusion coefficients corresponding to the solvent particles, the polymer particles and the colloidal microgels. The effect of changes in the particle concentration and the particle radius on the shrinking velocity is also studied. When a particle concentration gradient is applied, a particle concentration concentration gradient remains within the medium, which results in a pressure change over the inner particles. The maximum shrinking velocity of the particles is not affected by the particle concentration gradient. We conclude that the shrinking velocity of the colloidal microgels is insensitive to the application of a concentration gradient on the inner particles, given that the pressure variation induced over the microgel particles is not much higher than the pressure variation induced by the osmotic pressure jump. Finally, results concerning the drying of the colloidal microgel particles are presented. It is found that the diffusion through the cross-section of the colloidal microgel is the rate determining step. This diffusion is not hindered by the shrinking of the collo",

Members of the family Rhabdoviridae can be classified into at least four genera, all of which possess a bullet-shaped virion structure. We have investigated the intracellular and extracellular stages of the rhabdovirus LpCN1 by ultrastructural immunocytochemical analysis of its propagation and budding in the vector Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Lepidoptera) midgut.Methods: Cryostat-embedded insect midgut tissue was analyzed by transmission and immunoelectron microscopy. Antisera were raised to the glycoproteins of the virus and to the C. fumiferana midgut.Results: All major viral structural proteins of LpCN1 were expressed in the midgut epithelial cells with the exception of G1. Immunocytochemical staining revealed the presence of viral proteins in vesicles and small membrane-bound saccules within the epithelial cells. These structures did not stain with the anti-membrane midgut antisera. The extracellular stages of viral particle assembly were found as single viral particles, extracellular capsid-containing compartments, and free viral capsids. Although the virus particles had no other membrane envelope than the capsid membrane, viral particles were found attached to the microvilli of infected enterocytes.Conclusions:It is shown for the first time in an E-type rhabdovirus that the virus spreads in the vector host by entering the midgut. The virus forms compartments encompassing the viral capsids within the host cell cytoplasm, which may subsequently be released as free virions into the intestinal content.\n\n# Background\nRhabdoviruses of insects are highly host-specific and replicate only in a limited number of host taxa within the same order, mainly insects [bib_ref]  The nucleoprotein",

For example, in the above case, instead of looking to check for the existence of the word \"stray\", you will be looking for the existence of at least one word that is in the set and returns a true or false, indicating if the patient meets the requirement or not.\n- Since the set contains words indicating exclusion criteria, we will write if in the if statement\n\t- in place of the condition, \"if condition then true\",\n\t- in if else else in place of \" else if (else if condition) then true\",\n\t- in while in place of \"while condition\", and\n\t- in do else while in place of \"do while condition\".\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n## Coding Approach\n- The first thing that you are going to implement is the Trial-level eligibility.

The complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) prevent undesired activation of complement. They include factor H, C4b-binding protein (C4bp), CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59. To investigate the structural and functional homologies among these molecules, we have characterized full-length human or human/mouse chimeric C4bp genes, which lacked the major erythrocyte receptor target domains. A transgenic mouse model was established and the physiology of the human CRPs studied. We established that although the transgene was functional in mice, human factor H and CD35 were unable to rescue the phenotype of complement C3-deficient or factor B-deficient mice, whereas murine C4bp was functional. By contrast, a human C4bp transgene rescued the phenotype of the deficient animal, whereas murine C4bp was poorly functional. We also demonstrated that the transgene encodes a soluble protein capable of binding C4b. Transgenic animals were found to have significantly higher plasma levels of factor B in comparison to nontransgenic littermates, reflecting a role for C4bp regulation in the metabolism of the alternative pathway of complement and demonstrating compensation in plasma C4BP levels as a result of the overexpression of the transgene. The study provides strong evidence for the conservation of regulatory strategies in the human and murine complement systems.<EOD> Association of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Status With HPV Genotypes Detected From Genital Warts.\nImportance\nGenital warts (GWs) are linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and HPV vaccination may reduce the risk for GWs.",

When lead-based paints were used all over the world and most of the population had been occupationally and environmentally exposed to lead, chronic health effects of lead were clearly established [bib_ref]  Health Effects of Lead (Pb2+): New Developments, Goyer [/bib_ref] .

Due to the ban of lead-based paint and the implementation of legislation to protect these workers, chronic exposure is now limited.

A subset of 16,691 individuals with complete information on 23 variables was used to develop and test the new algorithm. A test for the difference in sensitivity was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of subjects identified by the algorithm was 92.4% (71.5-100%), compared with 11.9% (10.8-12.9%) achieved by the previously reported algorithm.

This study explores the use of a commercially available interference free (IF) sweat sensor to determine sweat glucose concentrations (SC) at rest and during exercise. Methods: 12 subjects underwent steady state conditions and 1-hour exercise at 67%, 82%, and 97% of individual anaerobic threshold (AT) during which SC, blood glucose (BG), and blood lactate (BLa) were periodically determined. Measurements were made over clean dry skin using an electrochemical sensor (AccuCheck 357706; AccuCheck, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). IF and non-IF electrochemistry were used for SC measurements. In addition, all samples were analysed using a standardized biosensor and enzyme methods (YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose and Lactate Analyser; YSI, Yellow Springs, USA). Results: SC correlated well with IF SC (r = 0.97) and with BG (r = 0.93). Measurements of BG and SC in the resting state (r = 0.94, n = 94) and in hyperglycaemia (r = 0.94, n = 19) produced similar results, although there was large variation between subjects. Compared with BG, SC was highly concordant over clean skin and all AT intensities (r 2 = 0.72\u20130.91) in the exercise state. SC changes with high intensity",

However, RT can compromise the DNA of both healthy and tumour cells. This exacerbation of DNA damage can trigger cell death in tumour cells through the mechanisms of apoptosis or necrosis. In contrast, in healthy and normal cells, this may manifest itself as reduced cell proliferation and, consequently, contribute to the inhibition of tumour growth (and, therefore, to an improved overall outcome). Low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) is defined as a regimen of radiation therapy that delivers less than 2 Gy divided over several treatment days. The effect of LD-RT on the tumour microenvironment is mediated through complex, non-targeted and nonspecific mechanisms. These have the potential to modify the activity of the immune system against tumours; in other words, LD-RT may increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy (which in recent years has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for cancer treatment). The first aim of this study was to evaluate, using a rodent model of radiation therapy, the effects of low doses of radiation on tumour growth and tumour infiltration by immune (CD4+ and CD8+) and non-immune (CD206+, CD31+) cells, as compared with conventional (high-dose, c-RT). The second purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of low radiation on the immune and non-immune cells of healthy organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen and kidney.

To date, the concept of reserve has not been well understood by clinicians, possibly because it has not been included in the widely used cognitive staging models of cognitive decline. The aims of this study are to develop a model that combines reserve, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and to test the predictive validity of such a model in a cohort of health check-up examinees. Methods: Two models of reserve combining MCI and dementia were designed. First, reserve was conceptualized as the interaction between the individual and the environment. Second, the accumulation of vascular lesions with the individual's ability to compensate for losses, or its \u2018neural capital\u2019, were considered. A logistic regression analysis was performed in a sample of 1,073 health check-up examinees. Results: The multivariate adjusted logistic regression models showed the model of \u2018reserve\u2019 composed of the interaction of reserve and MCI (orange model) to have higher adjusted odds ratios (ORs; 95% CI) in the discrimination of non-cases, including healthy subjects, from cases with mild neurological disorders than the model of \u2018reserve\u2019 composed of the accumulation of vascular lesions with the individual's ability to compensate for losses (red model). The inclusion of cognitive reserve in the cognitive staging models yielded increased validity in the prediction of cognitive staging. Conclusions: The orange model of reserve may improve the prediction of a more rapid onset of dementia.",

The prevalence of this abnormality among normals is estimated to be from 1 to 13 percent. All reported patients have had a low insulin response to oral glucose intolerance tests, a normal or elevated insulin response to i.v. glucose injection, and normal or elevated fasting levels of insulin. Hyperinsulinemic normals appear to have more clinical (obesity) abnormalities than nonhyperinsulinemic normals. Hyperinsulinemia, once induced in normals, was found to persist after 4 to 6 days if fasting was avoided. Metabolic studies done on patients with persistently normal insulin levels and patients with hyperinsulinemia have led to the conclusion that: (1) pancreatic \u03b2 cells respond to fasting and glucose loading with a greater insulin secretion than normal; (2) patients with hyperinsulinemia have greater insulin response to all degrees of glucose stimulation; (3) fasting hyperinsulinemics have lower hepatic glucose reutilization and a lower capacity for gluconeogenesis, although rates of exogenous glucose disappearance are normal; (4) the low insulin response of hyperinsulinemics to OGTT is not due to saturation of insulin receptors by physiologic levels of insulin circulating during the test, but appears to be due to an intrinsic insulin defect; (5) patients with hyperinsulinism have lower glucose disappearance rates at a glucose load of 500 mg/kg body wt, although the rate of increase of blood glucose with the load is similar to that of nonhyperinsulinemics; (6) hyperinsulinemia appears to be familial, and (7) hyperinsulinemia might be explained by genetic or environmental factors (possibly an increased adrenergic tone), by overactive \u03b2 cells, or by a low threshold for insulin secretion",

Apart from the prostate and sperm, there is no specific tissue that exhibits activity of this enzyme.1 Prostate-specific antigen serum activity correlates reasonably well with prostate size and severity of prostate cancer.1\n\n### PROSTATE CANCER\n\nElevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels with and without prostate cancer occur in several extratesticular abnormal conditions. These include seminal vesicle hypertrophy or atrophy (with elevations up to about 15 to 20 \u03bcg per liter) and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Other conditions, although not associated with prostate cancer, also lead to elevations in serum prostate-specific antigen. These include benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, prostate nodules, and the presence of carcinoma in situ of the prostate. Finally, because of the ubiquitous presence of prostate cells in the male body and the inability of prostate to divide without entering a prelethal state, serum prostate-specific antigen levels increase with age.

Growth was compared to control medium and to the articular fluid from the control rat, which we called young fluid (YF). The mitogenic activity of both these fluids on the synoviocytes was evaluated using counts of the cell population. YF induced a dose-dependent increase in the number of cells while the old medium had no effect up to the 50% dilution. Then, in order to evaluate a possible mitogenic influence of the growth hormone or a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation product, we compared the relative amounts of GAG in YF and old fluid. Our results show that the amount of GAG in YF was 73% lower than that in old fluid, thus suggesting that any mitogenic activity of YF is not due to a mitogenic GAG degradation product but to another yet unknown factor.<EOD> Inferring the function of non-coding mutations for understanding human disease\nAdvances in next-generation sequencing now allow researchers to systematically explore human variation on a previously unrealized scale.

Investigators received training in each tool before reviewing 12 de-identified patient charts for 60 minutes. The primary outcome measure for this study was the proportion of patients judged eligible by review. The chart-review process was recorded on video with a HIPAA-compliant audio recording device.\n\n    To evaluate tool feasibility in a real-world setting, investigators were prompted to complete a set number of eligibility screens on patient charts during a clinic visit. The charts were selected randomly from the previous day\u2019s clinic session. Investigators were prompted to use the tool only 50% of the time, allowing them the choice to review patients using either the CSES or traditional study eligibility review. During clinic visits, investigators documented the clinic date, eligible patients (according to the CSES), and patients for whom they completed the CSES. The study lasted 8 weeks.\n\n    <h3>Results</h3>\n\n    Results indicated that, compared with a traditional screening approach, the CSES required less time to review (P < .001) and resulted in an increase in the number of eligible patients (",

Interactions of tacrine and analogs with different A\u03b2 and Tau peptides were undertaken using a variety of techniques. Tacrine exhibited high affinity for peptides containing the second and third glycine residues of Tau and the first 42 residues of amyloid \u03b2 12 (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) but not for shorter peptides. A variety of tetrahydropyrido(2,1-c)benzodiazepine (2-5) analogues and a methyl carbazate derivative (6) were synthesised. The inhibition patterns for AChE and BChE suggested a preference for A\u03b2 1\u221242 as the substrate but a preference for",

The high incidence and prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in the general population, in particular the genital tract of women infected with human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), has encouraged research in identifi cation of risk factors for HPV infection and HPV-related diseases, aiming at identifi cation of strategies to prevent these diseases.Objective:The aim was to compare the prevalence and risk factors of HPV and HPV-associated disease in the general and HIV-infected populations.Methods:In this hospital-based case-control study, we compared the prevalence and risk factors for HPV and HPV-associated cervical disease in a matched case-control with patients (cases) and healthy controls. We enrolled 192 cervical carcinoma patients (15 -78 years; 83.8%) and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) patients (16 -74 years; 1.2%), as well as 192 ageand region-matched healthy controls (15 -80 years; 1.2%).

However, the correlation between NG2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis for CRC patients is unclear. Purpose: To explore whether the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis in patients with CRC were different between those with high and low expression of NG2. Method: The 166 CRC specimens and clinical records were enrolled in this research. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to confirm the expression levels of NG2. The statistical analysis was applied to identify the correlation between the expression of NG2 and clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis in CRC patients.

However, the lack of effective real-time fracture flowback monitoring methods can lead to the leakage of fracturing fluid to the surface environment and possible wellbore failure such as fracturing pipe break and cementing layer penetration failure. Meanwhile, the effect of flowback on fracture conductivity and gas production in shale gas wells is not clear. In this paper, a method of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fracturing flowback monitoring and estimation is presented by using an 8.23 km, 32-channel DAS line. By investigating the propagation characteristics of artificially generated fracture network acoustic signals, a calibration model is proposed to correct the fracture network acoustic signal amplitude for the purpose of improving the accuracy of DAS flowback monitoring. The relationship between the propagation speed of acoustic signals and liquid volume per unit area is established and the liquid volume per unit area of fracture network flowback can be estimated by using the relationship. The result shows that the measurement accuracy of DAS flowback velocity is improved from 0.89 to 0.75 of theoretical flowback velocity. Moreover, the flowback-rate estimation based on the real-time acoustic-propagation data shows obvious advantages. As a result, the flowback velocity and volume can also be estimated based on the measured velocity and the flowback data. The proposed study may have a certain degree of practical reference significance for effective fracture network flowback monitoring and estimation, fracture conductivity control and flowback risk analysis for shale gas wells.Supplementary materials for this article can be accessed on the website at https://doi.\n\n# Introduction\nThe shale gas development is a new exploration direction in the second half of the 21st century. The high well capacity and low well cost of the shale gas wells are the main reasons leading shale gas to be a major direction of exploration in recent years.

Pharmaceutical production is generally linked to international drug companies, which own patents for many drugs. The pharmaceutical industry in Latin America is mainly comprised of local firms, which produce a large variety of drugs, especially generics. This situation has been changing in recent years, with an increasing number of mergers of local producers with foreign producers. With regard to drug use, many countries have developed their own drug laws, which provide guidance to the choice of drugs to be included in their national lists. Some of the most common national drug lists contain the drugs which are part of the WHO Model List of Essential drugs. On the other hand, there are many drugs which are not included in the WHO Model List, but are used in some countries nevertheless: some are traditional medicines; others are expensive, imported drugs whose costs cannot be afforded by Latin American populations.<EOD> Interaction Between Prothrombin and Vitamin K-Dependent Coagulation Factors\nSummary We have studied the interaction between vitamin K dependent prothrombin and the other vitamin K dependent coagulation factors.

The in vitro effects of A II on amino acid incorporation by separated rat luteal cells (RLC) exposed to 2 X 10(-8) M and 2 X 10(-5) M of A II for 24 hr in serum-free media were investigated. Incorporation of valine and tyrosine into RLC protein decreased significantly for both concentrations of A II (P less than 0.05). The incorporation into acid soluble methoxy-phenyl valine into RLC protein also was inhibited by 2 X 10(-5) M A II (P less than 0.05). The depressed levels of protein incorporation due to A II appeared to be a consequence of the inhibition of amino acid incorporation rather than to a change in protein turnover rates. Cellular uptake of valine was not altered at either concentration of A II. These data suggest that luteal cell protein metabolism may be affected during steroidogenesis by mediators of the renin-angiotensin system produced in the theca-interstitial tissue.<EOD> Development of the cough reflex in healthy and asthmatic children.\nIn this paper we describe our data on the cough reflex in healthy children from the first year of life, and children with chronic asthma from the age of two till 10 years.

        "output": "## Conclusion\n\nYou have seen examples of assessing eligibility for patients of recruitment in clinical trials. \nAs you can see, some clinical trials are more demanding than others as they are either broader or narrower. A broader clinical trial can recruit more patients than a narrow clinical trial. You should keep this in mind when deciding for the eligibility assessment of clinical trials. \nThere are many elements you can consider when assessing the eligibility of patients for clinical trials. However, the two most important parameters are risk factors and contraindications that can decrease patients' quality of life if they enter a clinical trial. Contraindications should be the first factor to consider when deciding the eligibility of patients. \nRisks of clinical trials differ across trials. Some of them carry risks such as side effects or a decrease in quality of life, some of them may cause unnecessary harm due to inappropriate treatments or diagnostics, while others may not add anything new regarding patients' care or treatment. \nIt is not recommended for patients to participate in studies that do not carry any new information about patients' care or treatment. On the other hand, you can see that patients may suffer from unnecessary risk or discomfort when entered to these studies. \nEven though risk factors and contraindications should be considered as the most significant parameters to assess eligibility, you may have to weigh other factors such as patients' needs, severity of patients' treatment, or physicians' and patients' preferences while deciding on the eligibility assessment of patients for clinical trials. \n\nThe assessment of patient's eligibility for clinical trials is performed by clinical trial research assistants. Certain rules and regulations related to the conduct of clinical trials require these research assistants to assess eligibility. \nTrial research assistants also evaluate the eligibility of patients and decide on their el",

You will be randomly grouped into several teams working on the same Trial-level Eligibility (TL-E) problem. Each group will need to create and submit an individual team solution to the assignment folder. Also, you have to create a shared team solution.\n\n[SOLU3] This is Trial-level Eligibility (TL-E) problem. This problem is exactly the same one used in [SOLU2]. You may refer to that solution. You just have to create two new groups. Create groups `CIDX` and `CIDX1`, which will be respectively involved in `Trial-level Eligibility` and `Comparison` problems. In the CIDX group you should implement the function `trial_level_eligibility()`. In the `CIDX1 group` you should implement a function to compute the results for each trial.\n\nThere are a number of pre-existing, well-formed solutions to the TL-E problem. You could simply copy one of these solutions and modify it to change the patient's eligibility criteria without significantly changing the code structure. However, we request that you don't copy pre-existing TL-E solutions, unless you are able to modify the input and output structures to align with ours.\n\nFor this assignment, we will consider at least two different cases: `Gender` and `Age`.\n\n#### Assessment\n\n![assessment](img/S3-TL-E-assessment-overview.png)\n\n###### Trial-level Eligibility (TL-E)\nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility.",

We employed our established 3D printing method and prepared soft and stiff hydrogel pillars with different geometries and varying rigidity. We observed significant differences between the responses of fibroblasts to the stiffness of the microstructures, with stiffer microstructures yielding stronger cell-adhesion signals and more complex cellular patterns in the vicinity of the structure. These observations led us to conclude that our 3D-printed soft and stiff microstructures could be useful in investigating specific biological phenomena, such as mechano-sensing. In this work, we present the fabrication of 3D printable hydrogel structures with tunable stiffness in order to stimulate cells with controlled rigidity. Our data indicate that our 3D-printed hydrogel microstructures represent a versatile tool to study cells' mechanical response to external stimuli regarding their mechanical properties.\n\n# Introduction\nIn recent years, materials with tunable rigidity and adhesive properties have attracted great interest in various fields related to cellular biology, such as the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

The paper examines the current prevalence and correlates of mental distress among civil servants in Sokoto, Nigeria.Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted using a multistage random sampling technique to select 225 civil servants (116 males and 109 females). Mental distress was determined by using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Chi square test was used to determine the association between mental distress and other independent variables.Results:The prevalence of mental distress was 56.7% (130/225), with higher proportion among females (34.4% versus 44.2%, P = 0.022). Of the 130 respondents with mental distress, most (58.5%) had common mental disorders (CMDs), major depressive episode (MDE) (21.5%), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) (18.5%) while 10% had anxiety and depression related symptoms (AD). Factors significantly associated with mental distress among the civil servants were; female gender (P = 0.022), age of 21-40 (P = 0.019), lower income (P = 0.020), single marital status (P = 0.020) and being involved in court cases (P = 0.031).Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of mental distress among civil servants in Sokoto.

In equine medicine, blood transfusion is often required, which makes the availability of blood donations very important. Fresh frozen plasma from healthy donor horses has been shown to prevent the hemolytic transfusion reaction induced by alloantibodies in horses, and the mechanisms behind this ability are unknown. It is hypothesized that the protective component in the plasma is a Fc receptor that binds and removes alloantibodies.

The aim of this prospective investigation was to determine the level of omental neovascularization and potential correlating factors in patients with severe abdominal sepsis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients who were scheduled to undergo early secondary closure of abdominal compartment after an intestinal resection for severe abdominal sepsis were enrolled in the study. The omenta were harvested by a surgical procedure during the closure of abdominal compartments. In seven patients, an omental biopsy was performed using a diathermy device at the same operation. The same device was later used to examine histological specimens. Neovascularization score was expressed as the frequency ratio of small vessels (<50 microm in diameter) to the large vessels (>50 microm). Microcirculation was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (moorVMS-LDF).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven patients died (D-group) and eight recovered (R-group). The survivors showed a higher neovascularization score compared with the non-survivors. Histologically, the neovascularized omentum exhibited less connective tissue and more adipose tissue than the non-neovascularized omentum. The microcirculation of survivors was higher during the early phase of the post-operative course than that of the nonsurvivors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNeovascularization plays an important and unique role in omentum-induced wound healing as indicated by the findings of this study. In our case, survivors had greater neovascularization than non-survivors. The microcirculation of survivors was higher than that of non-survivors during the early post-operative course.

Although such cognitive deficits are clearly present, no tests with known sensitivity and validity have been standardized for the diagnosis of \u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d in PD. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the utility of eye-tracking technology in the early diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD. Using the iView X Hi-Speed eye tracker, participants completed a test protocol consisting of fixation stability, reaction time and a Stroop task. Eighteen PD patients participated in this study (average age 58.5 years). Results demonstrated reduced accuracy, speed and efficiency across a series of eye-tracking tasks that were well-correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Notably, PD patients scored significantly less accurately and slower in these tasks compared to healthy participants. These results suggest that eye-tracking technology offers a valid and objective measure of cognitive impairment and could be used as an indicator for the early detection of dementia in PD.<EOD> The potential of fetal transplant for treatment of Parkinson disease.\nThere is much current debate as to whether stem cell therapies will come to fruition in the near future.

        "output": "# Conventional ML Approaches on the TCI2018 Challenge\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of ML techniques is their ability to learn non-linear functions from data. In the following table are seven conventional ML techniques, along with some information about them. \n- **Decision trees**: These models classify data based on partitions of the input vector space. When testing, the decision tree is run, with the input vector placed at the node corresponding to the partition it is closest to, and the tree branches down. If the input vector is placed in a leaf node, it is assigned to the class corresponding to that leaf node. \n- **Random forests**: This is a variation of decision tree that uses bootstrap aggregation in order to create a vote-based classifier. Rather than relying on a single decision tree to assign a new datapoint to a certain class, aggregating the results from many decision trees produces a final class. The tree that is used to train the model usually uses a different, randomly chosen subset of the data compared against each training tree. \n- **Gradient boosting**: This technique produces a final model from a set of base models. Each base model tries to approximate its function to close the gap with the final model. The final result comes from ensemble functions to predict the final outcome. Each base model is a different tree, using the same parameters. \n- **Logistic regression**: This is a simple yet effective linear classifier. Instead of trying to classify discrete classes, it classifies data by a continuous variable. The model generates its own score to divide data into various classes. The decision for the class is made based on the score. \n- **Covariance discriminant analysis**: This is a linear method with the purpose to transform a data set into a higher dimensional space, where each datapoint is described by a linear combination of the original features (principal components), and where the linear combinations are related to a dependent variable. \n- **KNN**: It applies the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify data points. It determines which class a given datapoint should be assigned to by taking the majority of classes in neighborhoods of the datapoint. \n- **KNN 10 Classifier**: It applies the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify data points.

Spine kinematics is of great interest in clinicians, but the available data are limited because most of the research has been focused mainly on posture and disorders (e.g., disc herniation). In this study, we evaluated changes at the segmental and joint levels during pregnancy. Segments were monitored using skin markers placed on the 7th cervical spine (C7), 11th thoracic (T11), sacral (S1), and right greater trochanter of the femur. Lower lumbar spine segments were monitored using a nonrigid motion-tracking system based on ultrasonic tracking devices positioned on L1\u20135 vertebrae. The pelvis and right hip were tracked using skin markers on the left and right anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) and the sacroiliac joint was monitored using a skin marker placed centrally between the posterior iliac crests. We found that the lumbar lordosis, lumbar flexion during knee extension, and the left and right trochanteric ranges during gait decreased significantly during pregnancy. A significant increase in lumbar flexion with knee flexion was observed during pregnancy. In addition, a significant decrease in flexion and extension was observed in all hip joints during pregnancy. Our study has found that all joints of the lower spine, pelvis, and hip show decreased mobility as pregnancy progresses; these data could be useful in the future when evaluating women before, during, and after pregnancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 40 patients receiving a clinical trial of IPWT for wound care by a single surgeon in our institution. The patients were randomly chosen and assigned to an IPTW group and historical control group. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of treatment-related complications. The secondary outcomes of interest were the rate of wound complications and time to wound closure. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the IPWT group and the historical control group in terms of operation times and hospital stays. The IPWT group had no significant increase in wound complications. The IPWT wound healing process was faster compared to the controls. CONCLUSION: IPWT appears to be safe and feasible to apply postoperatively in high-risk patients who underwent gastrectomy, with acceptable recovery of healing wound process.<EOD> An Examination of the Effects of Pitch on Memory Task Performance\nThe present study examined the effect that pitch would have on participants' ability to",

As a result, an experiment may fail to evaluate certain cases.\n- There is little variety in terms of the sample population. In actual clinical data, many patients with low health status, various disease statuses, and various patient comorbidities are required.\n- In our system, there are two types of user interfaces: The front end and the back end. Each system must use the appropriate language to provide an easy-to-understand service for the user. For front-end developers, it is more convenient to develop the web-based system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but back-end developers should use Python and Django. However, it is not easy to achieve the goal of interoperable development by allowing the use of various programming languages in one application. As a way around, we plan to use R to develop the front end and Django to develop the back end. As you can see in the following table, the functions implemented with R are mainly used in the interface (front-end part), while the Django part is composed of the user management and database management.

Previous theoretical results have shown that oscillators that are described by simple maps can exhibit several modes of synchronization, depending on their parameter values and on the coupling topology. While the concept of synchronization is well understood, a rigorous proof of the existence of a desired mode of synchronized dynamics that is desired by the physiologist, is in many cases still missing.In this letter, we present a numerical scheme for the computation of the time evolution of the phase velocities. This dynamical vector data is then used to classify and describe the synchronization modes using a graph theory approach based on synchronization matrices. Our approach is validated using 2000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Kuramoto phase oscillators in case of periodic forcing.PACS number: 05.45.Xt 05.45.Ac\n\n# I. introduction\nTo understand the nature of information processing in neural networks, it is crucial to determine how neuronal populations synchronize their activity.\nThis was in fact the rationale behind the initial introduction of Kuramoto' models: a theoretical framework to study phase oscillator networks and synchronization. The basic ingredient of Kuramoto phase oscillator networks is the concept of synchronization for oscillator populations.\nRecently, this concept has been linked to neural fields, the theoretical framework underlying the analysis of brain wave dynamics in EEG/MEG, see.\nThe aim of this letter is to provide a scheme to computationally assess the synchronization of phase oscillator models. Our strategy here is twofold. First, we propose a numerical scheme to compute the time evolution of the phase velocities. Second, the analytical use of the Kuramoto-like dynamical equations allows us to describe the type and the degree of synchronization present between the oscillators. Our approach is validated using a simple Kuramoto type model of coupled phase oscillators. * Electronic address: francois.cognet@paris-sciences-et-lettres.fr.\n\n## Ii. phase modeling\nIn this section, we provide a brief",

For a long time, the chloroplast genetic transformation system and synthetic biology systems based on the chloroplast system have lagged far behind the eukaryotic cell systems of yeast and mammals. However, in recent years, great advances have been made, mainly due to the discovery and use of the synthetic biology toolkit. As many previous examples in this special issue have shown (for example, , synthetic biology can change the world, and especially the genetic basis of agriculture, with tremendous improvements, both in efficiency and in the cost of production of plants with novel traits.\nFor example, the genetic transformation of potato leaves has been used by some researchers to generate transgenic potatoes [bib_ref]  The genetic transformation of potato, Salinas [/bib_ref] . This may serve as a model for the commercialization of this transformation technique for some economically important species of the Solanaceae family and thus benefit the commercial production of genetically modified food crops. For certain reasons, there are many plants in the Solanaceae family that are economically important. These include eggplant, potato, pepper, tomato, and green peas. Notably, the transgenic potatoes, which are commercially grown today, are mainly for industrial purposes, although there are still certain varieties of potatoes for domestic consumption.

The subjects all had a Transtibial-amputation. Each subject was requested to walk with each prosthesis on a level treadmill at self selected velocities. Motion analysis techniques were used to collect body segment kinematics and video data was captured concurrently. Joint angles were computed using computer programs for the analysis of gait. Gait velocity was lower for the bionic prostheses when compared to the Conventional Prostheses. The bionic knee caused a reduction in the stance phase knee extension angle and a reduction in the duration of the stance phase of a step cycle. Also a reduction in the knee flexion during the swing phase was observed for the bionic knee compared to the conventional. There were also differences observed for the other joints of the lower limb.<EOD> \nIn 1850 P.

We do not use the stop words list of Python to extract the most popular stop words.\nSecond, we tokenize the preprocessed data. The tokenization is identical to that of the previous sections except that there is no padding token because the length is fixed. \nFinally, we train the model using the train set. We employ the cross-entropy loss function and optimize it using the Adam optimizer. During optimization, we set the number of epochs to 500, the size of the learning rate decay to 0.95, and the initial value of the learning rate to 0.0001.\n\n\n\n\nYou can examine the trained model by running the command `Inspector('convolutional_lstm_eligible_notes.h5')`. You can examine the trained model by running the command `Inspector('convolutional_lstm_eligible_notes.h5')`. From left to right, the number of patients is 755, the eligible patients is 555, and the excluded patients is 200. All the figures show that the model achieves good performance.\n![INST] \n\nNote that the eligible patients and the excluded patients should be equal because the eligible criteria do not change. However, the number of patients is different, which is natural to happen because the patients participating a clinical trial vary in each trial, and the size of each trial is different.\nTo examine the details of the trained model in more depth, you can run the command `Details('train')`.\n![INST] \n\nFrom the plots, we can see that the output nodes of dense_5 and dense_5_1 are more informative than those of others. Additionally, we observe that the layers of both convolutional neural networks, 35 and 53, have almost no effect on the output.\n\nAnother way of model",

        "output": "<EOD> Repeated Low-Level Radiation and Cancer\n\nIn the past, concerns about cancer risk from low-level radiation (LLR) have often been based on out-ofdate science or anecdotal evidence. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview, primarily for the nonscientist, of the scientific evidence concerning risk assessment of cancer from LLR. We will examine the existing biological principles and the available epidemiological evidence for the cancer risk from exposure to LLR. The epidemiological evidence will be addressed from multiple perspectives involving study design, the radiation dose range, and the nature and dosimetry of radiation exposure. Because exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) can have either stochastic or deterministic effects, both the risk models and their validity will be discussed, which is essential in evaluating cancer risk from multiple low-dose exposures. It is well recognized that the current models are not perfect, and in some cases are flawed. Because low-dose cancer risk assessments have often been the focus of substantial heated debate, we also discuss the issue of risk controversies and communication, with a focus on LLR.\n\n## Biology and dose response studies for cancer\n\n## Types of radiation\nRadiation is defined as ionizing energy that is deposited in matter and which ionizes (splits) atoms and molecules, thereby generating free radicals. Electromagnetic waves are a form of radiation and are found on the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays (the most energetic) to microwave radiation with wavelengths greater than about 10 meters. Photons and elementary particles are two classes of particles that are found in radiation. Radioactive and low-level sources may emit particles or rays of electromagnetic radiation . Radioactive sources emit any one of the following types of radiation, in addition to combinations thereof: gamma rays, beta particles, alpha particles, neutrons, X-rays, ultraviolet, soft and hard 1 Electronic mail: ewingr@umich.edu rays, and millimeter waves (extreme energy low-level radiation). The radioactive source must be decaying slowly without any energy generation when it is used in low-level radiation applications, such as sterilization, germicides, and the treatment of certain diseases.\nGamma radiation:",

Methods:We compared CD4+ T cell count kinetics using multiple-timepoint CD4+ T cell count data from 1162 HIV-1 infected patients from the APROCO cohort enrolled in the French per protocol population from the time of HIV seroconversion. Results:Four hundred and twelve patients were infected with HIV-1 CRF02_AG. Among these, 47 (11.5%) had superinfection with HIV-2. The median CD4+ T cell counts of super-infected patients was 23.0 cells/mm3 lower (P = 0.004) than those of non-super-infected patients at the time of the HIV-2 diagnosis (18 months, 95% confidence interval 9.8\u20132.1 cells/mm3; 36 months, 7.9\u20133.9 cells/mm3; 60 months, 10.1\u20130.9 cells/mm3) but not thereafter. This difference was mainly due to the large difference within 18 months. None of the other HIV-1 variants showed a similar difference between superinfected patients and non-super-infected patients. Conclusion:HIV-1 infection is associated with a lower CD4+ T cell count among HIV-1 patients infected with the CRF02_AG variant but not among patients with other HIV-1 variants. Superinfection with HIV-2 can have an additional effect on the CD4+ T cell count only during the first 3 years of HIV-1 infection.

This study examined the efficacy of a pain management protocol for pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental, prospective, pre-post comparison study that was conducted in a pediatric hospital in Riyadh, KSA. The multimodal pain management protocol consisted of education and training modules, preadmission screening questionnaires, and an interdisciplinary team of pain management health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, and physical therapists. Descriptive statistics, paired sample t-tests, and an independent sample t-test were used to determine the efficacy of the protocol and the comparison between pre-and postimplementation groups. Results: There was significant difference in pain relief as measured by decreased length of hospital stay between the preimplementation group (2.98 days; SD = 3.81) and the intervention group (14.80 days; SD = 8.73). The use of fentanyl decreased by a ratio of 1:2.4 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Further significant improvement in pain management strategies was confirmed through qualitative analysis of the inpatient pain management questionnaire completed by the intervention group after implementation of the pain management protocol. Conclusions: Results indicated that implementation of the pain management program was effective in improving pain",

A retrospective chart review of medical records of 185 patients was completed. Eighty-five (45.9%) enrolled in hospice care, whereas 100 (54.1%) did not. A logistic regression was performed to assess if hospice enrollment was a significant predictor of mortality, number of physician home care visits, length of physician home care, and days at home. Hospice enrollment was found to be a significant factor for all areas of analysis except length of physician home care. The results suggest that individuals enrolled in hospice care may, in fact, receive more complete care than unenrolled cancer patients due to more aggressive symptom management and better supportive/alternative care.<EOD> .\nIn 78 patients with an acute myocardial infarction we investigated coronary flow reserve (CFR) measured by means of the Doppler echocardiography during the first week after onset, i.e.",

Here our aim is to study several marketed drugs or drugs in various stages of development for their interactions with the 11C-dantrolene transporter. We investigated interactions of six marketed drugs or drugs in development with a 11C-dantrolene. Drugs investigated were the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ), the lipid regulating probucol, and the cardiac drug cibenzoline (CZ); two novel antiprotozoal drugs imidazolin-2-ylpropionic acid (IMA), and dihydroisothiocyanate (DHI) (S,S) prodrugs of NITD-916 and NITD-244, respectively. The cationic drug quinine, serving as a positive control, decreased the uptake of 11C-dantrolene by \u223c50%. On the other hand, CBZ, IMA, NITD-244 (DHI), and probucol increased 11C-dantrolene uptake by about twofold, whereas CZ decreased. We assessed these interactions by two methods: by direct comparison of the uptake of 11C-dantrolene in presence of drug and in control conditions, and the amount of drug taken up by the cells. All drugs were taken up by the cells. In general, our results support that drugs taken up by cells can indirectly affect transporter-mediated uptake of membrane bound peptide tracers, such as 1",

In this scenario, you are required to determine the eligibility of patients based on their medical history in the medical notes. You are assumed to be provided with patient notes of three diseases: breast cancer, schizophrenia, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nYou will receive the eligibility assessment of medications according to the on-going clinical\ntrials. A clinical trial is categorized into single arms and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this scenario, you are asked to examine the eligible of clinical trial according to two types of clinical trials: a single-arm clinical trial and RCT. An RCT has two groups: (1) a control group with usual care or placebo, and (2) an experimental group with a drug treatment. \n        Each clinical trial has its inclusion and exclusion criteria. A clinical trial needs to determine whether the participants are eligible for the clinical trial using these criteria or not. For a single-arms, all of the participants can be recruited to the clinical trial. For RCTs, at least 5 participants need to be recruited as a comparator. This means that participants of an RCT will be chosen not to be part of the experimental group.\n        Each clinical trial is listed with a unique trial-identification number: TR01, TR02, TR03. For each participant of clinical trial, there is a specific trial-participation number. The three clinical trials (TR01-TR03) are organized as a list. For example, TR01-P1, TR01-P2, ...",

We have developed two simple in-vitro microscale assays for use in the primary screening of cocaine analgesic medications; a rapid quantitative cocaine-induced plasma neurotransmitter release assay to assess the cocaine antagonist (prodrug) properties of the cocaine analgesic medication, and a qualitative screening assay to assess cocaine pharmacokinetic properties. The assay development was completed on a microscale using a manual pipetting system to facilitate the production of standardized assay samples. Assay precision is similar to that achieved using manual pipetting systems in larger scale assays. The cocaine induced plasma neurotransmitter release assay utilizes the microscale version of the in vivo cocaine antagonist assay (IC(50) = 4.2+/-2.5 nM) developed in our laboratories, which measures the cocaine antagonist induced inhibition of plasma and whole blood cocaine-induced dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and epinephrine neurotransmitter release using fluorometric detection. The assay development for in vitro cocaine pharmacokinetics assays was achieved using a high affinity cocaine specific antiserum produced by immunizing sheep with cocaine. A microscale non-quantitative in vitro cocaine pharmacokinetics assay was developed to determine possible drug (cocaine) serum interference, due to cocaine serum binding, in the antiserum assay system.

Identifying its prognostic factors will facilitate a more individualized management of PDA in preterm infants. Objective: Therefore, the current study aimed to retrospectively assess prognostic factors for PDA in a single-center neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over a 17-year period. Patients and Methods: The prospective data set included the birth information, diagnosis, vital signs, medications, echocardiographic findings, biochemical measurements, and outcome data for the preterm infants and neonates at our NICU who were admitted between January 1 1999 and December 31 2015 were reviewed and analyzed.

Western-blot analysis using anti-ME antibodies showed that the C-terminal tail has three major isoforms. Because the C-terminal domain in maize NADP-ME is known to be important for the binding of the enzyme to the cereal endosperm protein (57-kDa protein) and the cytosolic association of maize chloroplast NADP-ME, we investigated whether the new isoforms also associate with the cytosol in the same manner as the previously reported C-truncated NADP-ME. We infiltrated agrobacterium into maize immature cobs, in which the NADP-ME is only expressed postanthesis, to examine the cytosolic association of the NADP-ME. The results indicated that the new long isoforms showed a cytosolic association much like the previously reported short isoforms, despite the additional 6 amino acids, and that the cytosolic association was severely impaired or completely abolished in the enzymes that showed a deficiency of the C-terminal domain by the absence of 6 amino acids (i.e. the C-truncated forms and long isoforms). We found no evidence of an interaction between the 57-kDa protein and any NADP-MEs tested (either the native or the truncated NADP-MEs). The analysis of the kinetic properties of the wild-type NADP-ME indicated that the kinetic parameters V max , K m -glucose 6-phosphate, and K m -oxaloacetate were dependent on the C-terminal domain.

Although obesity has been correlated with an increased risk of hematological cancers (HCs), it is unknown whether bariatric surgery leads to decreased risk of developing these cancers. We used the US Military Health System (MHS) database to test for changes in risk of development of various hematological malignancies in veterans with morbid obesity after bariatric surgery was performed.Methods. A prospective historical cohort design was used with participants from the MHS who underwent clinical bariatric surgery between 2014 and 2019 and served as the bariatric surgery cohort. Healthy control participants without any history of cancer who did not undergo bariatric surgery during the same time period were selected from the population-based MHS database. The incidence rates of HCs (i.e., acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], Hodgkin lymphoma), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and hematological neoplasms (i.e., myelodysplastic syndromes, plasmocytoma, multiple myeloma, and myelofibrosis) were analyzed up to 10 years postoperatively. Univariate logistic regression and, when appropriate, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the differences in rates of HCs in the cohorts before and after bariatric surgery.Results. A total of 1973 and 3443 people who underwent bariatric surgery between 2014 and 2019 and served as the bariatric and healthy control cohorts, respectively, were included in the study.

Furthermore, a previous study showed that high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, were significantly associated with coronary heart disease events and mortality, even though other studies did not show the same effect. In addition to CRP, elevated systemic oxidative stress is also correlated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among the various medications, inhaled glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory airway diseases. Several studies have reported that long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increases the risk for an atherosclerotic event in patients with diabetes.

The aim was to test the hypothesis that changes in grip strength are slower in people with diabetes type 2 than those in the control population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective follow-up study with repeated measures was performed with a 5-year difference in time between measures (48-month interval). Data were drawn from the Malm\u00f6 Preventive Project, which is an intervention study with a 48-month follow-up period. The study was designed as a cohort study. The final sample included 100 men and 122 women with diabetes and 128 men and 80 women with risk factors, and two controls (reference group) in each gender. Measurements were made by a standardized technique and analyzed with descriptive statistics.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nData were analyzed with repeated measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGrip strength increased in both groups during the period studied. For men, this increase was 2.6\u2009kg (23.9%) in the group with diabetes and 3.05\u2009kg (20.4%) in the group with risk factors. The increase for women was 3.4\u2009kg (27.7%) in the group with diabetes and 3.5\u2009kg (19.7%) in the group with risk factors. In a 48-month interval, grip strength increased significantly in both men (0.65\u2009kg, P=0.000) and women (0.8\u2009kg, P=0.001). Grip strength also increased significantly over time in both groups studied, with men with diabetes exhibiting the lowest increase (P=0.035, CI=-1.29, -0.11) in grip strength among all four groups.

Materials and Methods: To investigate whether differences existed in the neutropenia characteristics between patients undergoing standard and extended cycles of chemotherapy, or between patients treated with and without granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF), we compared the clinical characteristics, including the cumulative dose of cisplatin and G-CSF and the serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level, of 135 patients who were recruited in this study. The 135 patients were treated with 212 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We observed neutropenia according to G-CSF prophylaxis, chemotherapy schedule (standard or extended cycles), and cumulative dose of cisplatin. Results: Patients who had received standard cycles showed a greater prevalence of neutropenia than those who had received extended cycles; G-CSF prophylaxis, cumulative cisplatin dose, or age had no effect on neutropenia (p >0.05). In patients who had received standard cytotoxic agent cycles, there was no significant association between neutropenia and all patients' characteristics, or the G-CSF level in patients with or without G-CSF prophylaxis, or the cumulative cisplatin dose. However, in patients who had received the extended cycles, patients with a low cumulative dose of cisplatin showed significantly higher absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) (796/\u03bcL) than those who received high doses (796/\u03bcL vs. 505/ \u03bcL, p=0.029). Conclusions: There was no association between the cumulative dose of cisplatin and neutropenia. This suggests that neutropenia in cisplatin-treated patients may not be dose-dependent.\n\n# Introduction\nCytotoxic anticancer agents are known to cause severe myelosuppression.

C1, C2, and C3 were covalently bonded in a 1\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20091 ratio on a piece of silicon plate with the aid of a \u03b3-ray technique at the initial level of 0.4 mg/cm2. The sensor array was applied to the recognition and determinations of Cu2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+ in food samples with a detection limit of 1.0-1.2 \u03bcg/mL (ppm level). A series of fluorescence titration experiments were performed to evaluate the recognition ability of the array sensor toward the corresponding metal ions. To further improve the recognition efficiency, 0.5-1.2 equivalent of each analyte to the covalently bonded sensor array was added. Based on the results of the experiments and the recognition mechanism of the analytes toward the sensor, a recognition mechanism was proposed. This sensor array has great potential for the identification and determination of metal ions. More importantly, this new approach may be extended to the preparation of other covalently bonded sensor arrays with high sensitivity, stability, sensing performance and the ability for the recognition of a variety of analytes.<EOD> Differential translocation of bacterial genomic and plasmid DNA to the nuclear compartment by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nsp1 and nsp8 proteins: A potential interplay\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently wreaking devastation across the world.

The outcome among these patients is almost invariably poor with some centres achieving a 5 year overall survival in the region of 1.5 per cent. In these patients the chance of a cure appears to be dependent upon the interval since the presentation of the primary lesion and the subsequent metastatic spread.

Study design: Systematic review. Methods: Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and bibliographies of retrieved studies were searched from January 1970 to February 2009. We included all studies providing data on the clinical utility of HPV testing to detect or manage CIN and excluded studies reporting only HPV test characteristics. Results: Ninety-five studies met inclusion criteria (33 screening studies, 47 colposcopy studies, 15 surveillance studies). Sixty-four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the remainder being prospective cohort or cross-sectional studies. All colposcopy studies were from Europe and compared HPV testing (using hybrid capture-II assay [HC-II]) to colony screening (HPV negative women receive no further investigation). In screening RCTs, pooled sensitivity for detection of CIN2+ ranged from 60.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.7-70.9) to 72.4% (95% CI 57-92.5) and specificity ranged from 94.7-98.8%.

Adipose tissue constitutes an important metabolic and immunological organ, which controls the body's energy balance by storing or releasing fatty acids. Adipose tissue is also a site for the action of different adipokines, such as visfatin and leptin. Both visfatin and leptin play a pivotal role in lipid metabolism. In the current study, cellular lipolysis was examined in human adipose tissue explants from obese patients under different in vitro conditions. Methods and Results. We found that in addition to leptin, the adipokine visfatin reduced the lipolytic activity in human adipose tissue. Interestingly, in contrast to lipolysis, the gene expression of the visfatin receptors GPR17 and GPR160 showed a slight increase under visfatin treatment, whereas the expression of the leptin receptor (OB-R) was reduced. Furthermore, visfatin diminished adiponectin gene expression in cultured human adipose tissue explants. Conclusions. Our results indicate that in addition to leptin, visfatin has an insulin sensitizing effect in adipose tissue and may be involved in the modulation of visfatin action (e.g. via the visfatin receptor GPR17). However, further studies are required to determine the possible role of visfatin and its cellular mechanisms in the regulation of cellular lipolysis.<EOD> The Use of a Vacuum Membrane in the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure.\nIN a patient with congestive heart failure the heart is usually in a state of high tension or increased work. The high tension of the heart wall does not allow of the utilization, in its full measure, of any inotropic agent. The inotropic agent of choice is digitalis, but the heart, although more under the influence of this drug, is in a higher tension. Theoretically, if the heart wall could be reduced in tension, more of the inotropic agent could be utilized",

With particular attention paid to the bile, urinary, blood, serum and histologic features of the diseases observed. We have also described the occurrence of various types of infections and malignant diseases in these patients. At the University of Wisconsin General Hospital; Madison, Wise., there are 1400 beds and 60,000 cases are treated annually. The Wisconsin East Asian Clinic, with several subclinics, maintains more than 300 employees including doctors, nurses, administrators and clerks. In addition, there are about 4000 registered out-patients. Among them, 700 or more are treated in the surgical ward; 1600 are treated in the Chinese Clinic; 300 are treated in the medical ward and outpatient clinics; and more than 200 are treated in the gynecologic clinic. The clinic is under the direction of Professor of Obstetrics and Gymnastics of the Medical School, Dr. Y. Chang of Nanjing, Medical College, and the staff consists of five resident doctors and six senior specialists of each division under Dr. Y. Chang's direction. In August 1964, one of the authors (M. G.) began working in the clinic for about three weeks. The clinic has been under the leadership of its first director (Yung-Wern Li) for the past 40 years. During that period, it has grown into a large clinic and medical center. A Chinese hospital has, for many years, served as a medical center for Chinese patients in this country. In order to better serve those patients, the Chinese hospital was established in 1958.

Ischemic damage in the adult brain is irreversible and is associated with many of the symptoms of the age-related neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's disease. Because adult neural progenitor cells are incapable of long-distance migration and differentiation to integrate into neuronal networks to replace lost brain structures, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous bone marrow (BM)-derived CD34(+) progenitor cells in adult mice might be capable of multilineage differentiation, migration, and integration into the postischemic rodent brain. After intratumoral implantation into an adult FVB mouse brain, CD34(+) cells were found to engraft, localize to the brain, and extend processes that anatomically integrate into existing brain circuitry. Transplanted cells differentiated to neuronal, glial, and vascular phenotypes and formed cellular networks and cortical structures that were morphologically and functionally integrated with host gray matter. CD34(+)-treated animals had measurably improved motor function compared with control subjects. These findings reveal that endogenous CD34(+) cells can migrate to the postischemic brain, differentiate, and form structures that are capable of integrating with host neurons to enhance anatomical and functional outcome after brain injury. These studies indicate that CD34(+) cells are good candidate cells for cellular replacement strategies in neurological diseases where endogenous stem cells do not populate the diseased region and where current cell-transplantation methods, which do deliver cells to the brain, have limited efficacy.<EOD> Association of the Ketogenic Diet with Metabolic Parameters and Clinical Status in a Population of Adults with Obesity.

Tc-99m cardiac indices were significantly lower than RHC cardiac indices in each patient, reflecting the small cardiac output in the patient population. The pulmonary artery to aorta time-activity curve (Tc-99m perfusion) ratio was significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with the transpulmonary thermodilution pulmonary artery systolic pressure (TTE PASP) and the mean of the pulmonary artery (Tc-99m perfusion) and aortic transpulmonary thermodilution temperature (Tc-99m PAAT, AoATP) ratios (r = 0.982).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTc-99m red blood cell perfusion with a high efficiency linear photoscensor is easily performed, requires no sedation or contrast, and produces no ionizing radiation. The authors suggest Tc-99m red blood cell perfusion be used in clinical conditions where a fast cardiac output measurement is needed, especially when radiation and sedation are contraindicated, when there is insufficient time to measure cardiac output by other methods, or when serial cardiac output measurements are needed",

To be even more confident, you should be able to choose one more rigorous evaluation strategy such as the hold-out test cross validation.  Moreover, you should know how to calculate the receiver operating characteristic curve as well as the area under the curve score of a classifier whose parameters should be fitted by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\n\nNote that if your data points are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), then you only need to test the performance of your model using one cross validation or test set.  But, if you have a dependent or correlated data, it may not be appropriate to split your data into a training and test set.  Therefore, you need to prepare a series of training and test data sets.  Thus, cross validation is crucial for machine learning applications that rely on training data sets.\n\n\n# Introduction\nIn this chapter, we briefly review how we develop a cross validator. We also present several efficient cross validators, which work efficiently for data sets that have a hierarchical structure such as a medical knowledge database or a collection of medical notes, and we then apply them to a medical knowledge database and a corpus of medical notes.  We then present an overview of a repertoire of cross validators, the most notable being the k-fold, leave-one-out, and holdout test cross validators, and show how to implement them using the R statistical programming language. Finally, we introduce the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) scores, and show how we can use both the training and test data to get the AUC scores.  The rest of this Chapter is dedicated to cross validators.\n\n## Cross Validation\nIn order to evaluate performance of a classifier accurately, we split the data set for training into training and validation sets.\n    Let X be observed data matrix where x j is a row where each element x ij is an observed value.\n    x = ...\n    x 1,1 ... x 1,n\n    x 1,2 ... x",

Most coughs are caused by viruses and settle down by themselves, but some people develop persistent coughing which can be anywhere from 8 weeks to several years. This is called chronic cough. People with chronic cough find the symptom distressing and it can have a major impact on their quality of life. Patients with chronic cough often report a sensation at the back of their throat which makes them feel an urge to cough. There is some evidence that Lidocaine (an anaesthetic used during medical procedures) can suppress a person's cough when given to patients via a nebuliser (a machine that turns liquid into a fine mist).  It is currently unknown whether using a local anaesthetic, such as Lidocaine, in the form of a throat spray would successfully suppress a person's cough. A throat spray would be an easier treatment option in chronic cough patients. Thus, the investigators research aims to compare cough rates, severity and urge to cough scores between Lidocaine throat spray and nebulised Lidocaine.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMale and female subjects, age 18 years and over.\nHistory of cough for more than 8 weeks.\nNormal chest x ray\nChronic idiopathic cough or chronic cough resistant to treatment of specific triggers.\n\nYou should enter the clinical trial-level eligibility: \nTrial-level eligibility: would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation\n\n#### Full-eligibile Patient\nWhen a patient is fully",

The Evaluation of In Vivo Anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis Activity of Ethnomedicinally Used Crude Plant Extracts of South Africa. Molecules 2021, 26, 614. https://doi.Abstract:Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health burden. Conventional TB drugs are associated with adverse side effects and the development of drug resistance has resulted in numerous challenges for the treatment of TB. In this study, we assessed the in vivo anti-TB activity of 17 ethnomedicinally used plant extracts. Fifteen plant extracts were prepared using the cold extraction method, whereas the hot extraction method was applied for the remaining two plant extracts. The evaluation of the in vivo anti-TB activity of crude plant extracts was performed using the broth dilution method and results were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which was calculated based on the ratio of the inoculum to extract. The results recorded showed that all the crude plant extracts were able to reduce M. tuberculosis growth when tested at a concentration of 1 mg mL \u22121 . The in vivo anti-TB activity of these extracts was further confirmed by microscopic observations of colony morphology on nutrient agar plates, while the in silico studies further revealed the presence of some active anti-TB components within the selected plant species. These findings suggest that the plants could be an alternative natural source for further research and development of antimycobacterial drugs.\n\n# Introduction\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), a causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains a major cause of death",

Here we describe a man who underwent neuro-spine surgery involving hypothermia for spine stabilization followed by rewarming which led to NDI and DI through a period of 3 hours in the absence of any vasopressin administration. Case Description: A 46 year old Caucasian male with severe anemia (Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL) and chronic renal insufficiency at a baseline of 2ml/min/1.73sq meters and ESRD was planned to undergo a decompressive laminectomy with instrumented fusion and intramedullary spinal cord stimulators for long term pain management and control of spinal neuropathy. His anemia was corrected preoperatively with transfusion. Given the hypothermia risks associated with his renal insufficiency and anemia, anesthetic hypotension and neurological monitoring were to be held to a minimum. The preoperative hematocrit for this surgery was 29.3 and the hematocrit prior to induction of anesthesia was 31.1. He was started to the theater in a supine position with peripheral catheters in his arms and legs. An intravenous 22gauge catheter was inserted in his left antecubital fossa for venous access. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and fentanyl followed by atropine 0.5mg. A laryngeal mask airway was inserted in lieu of intubation and he was cooled to about 29 C by the surgical team. The target body temperature was to be lowered to 25 C and then maintained for up to 2 hours. The surgical team was to use",

The use of tuberculosis self-testing to complement contact tracing in low tuberculosis incidence countries. BMJ Open 2022;12:e056214.\nIntroduction Globally, nearly half of tuberculosis (TB) cases are missed. Contact tracing has been a cornerstone of public health practice in TB. However, contact tracing is difficult and costly to conduct. Self-testing to diagnose TB can potentially improve the efficiency, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of contact tracing. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential impact of TB self-testing on TB transmission and costs. Methods We estimated the potential impact of TB self-testing on transmission and costs using a dynamic transmission model and simulated three scenarios: case finding through active case finding and contact tracing, self-testing alone and combined use of TB self-testing and case finding. To examine the cost-effectiveness of TB self-testing, we also used two different costing methods from the societal and health system viewpoints. results In low TB incidence countries, the estimated number of cases to be averted varied depending on the scenario. In the active case finding and contact tracing strategy, 31.01 million cases were estimated to be averted, whereas in the TB self-testing alone strategy, approximately 5.6 million cases were estimated to be averted, and in the combined use of TB self-testing and case finding strategy, 25.75 million cases were estimated to be averted. The societal viewpoint costutility analysis showed that TB self-testing was cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from \u00a313\u2005898 to \u00a317\u2005984 compared with no intervention or active case finding and contact tracing strategy, respectively. Conclusion Our study provides new evidence on TB self-testing, showing a high potential of reducing missed TB cases under low TB incidence country settings. We believe this novel approach to TB control will contribute to TB ending. Registration number The study protocol was",

The aim of a clinical study is to increase our knowledge on how our bodies work and how to help those who may have or are at risk of a disease. The following clinical trials are currently open here at the Clinical Research Center of Caucasia University.\n\nTITLE\n\nA 52-year-old African American man with a history of heavy smoking and drinking, describes progressive dysphagia that began several months ago. He first noticed difficulty swallowing meat. His trouble swallowing then progressed to include other solid foods, soft foods, and then liquids. He is able to locate the point where food is obstructed at the lower end of his sternum. He has lost a total of 25 pounds.\n\nTITLE\n\nTitle: Cigarette Smoking and Oral Microbiota\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBackground:~- Normal bacteria and other tiny organisms (the microbiota) live in the mouth and nose. They contribute to human health in many ways, including digesting food and balancing hormones. Testing samples from the mouth can show how microbiotas are related to health and disease. However, the microbiota in a person's mouth differs depending on the methods of collection and the part of the mouth that is tested. Understanding what can change the microbiota (including mouth sites, and what a person eats or smokes) will give more information on how to study oral microbiota and smoking-related cancers and other diseases.~Objectives:~To see how smoking affects the microbiotas in mouth and nose.~To determine which collection method for mouth specimens should be used for studying microbiota.~Eligibility:~Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been using tobacco products regularly for at least 5 years.~Individuals at least 18 years of age who have never smoked.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.~Participants will have a dental exam. They will provide a saliva sample. The dentist will take swabs from the inside of the mouth, including the tongue, tons",

A pair of the primers and a probe were designed and used to detect CSFV, while a set of the two primers and one probe were used to detect PRV and another pair of the two primers and one probe were used to detect PCV2 and PRRSV. The designed primer and probe sequences showed high specificity and sensitivity for the four viruses and had no cross-reaction with another 17 swine viruses. For PRV, CSFV, PRRSV and PCV2, the four multiplex real-time RT-PCR were validated to have a limit of detection as low as 10 2 to 10 4 copies and a detection limit corresponding to 5000 to 500 copies per reaction. The results further indicated that the designed primers were able to amplify the standard plasmid and the four standard viral genes. Finally, the newly designed multiplex real-time RT-PCR was examined for its specificity and sensitivity by using 24 clinical samples, all of which were correctly classified. In addition, all the detected viruses showed consistent with the results obtained by the traditional one-time detection of the four viruses and the gold standard method of virus isolation. We hope the developed assay could improve the clinical testing quality of the four viruses with a higher cost-efficiency and shorter detection time.\n\n# Introduction\nAs a fatal viral infection, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes severe economic losses to pig farming industries worldwide [bib_ref]  The classical swine fever",

Our team is going to suggest some of the best ones for your consideration. \n- JSP (Java Server Pages): Sun's own JSP is very popular for web services developed by Java programmers.\n- ASP (Active Server Pages): Microsoft's proprietary server-side technology. ASP, like PHP, is very scripted, so does not allow you to make the web page look as you like without knowing some basics of HTML and JAVA syntax. JSP works the same way and JSP is pretty much the closest technology which provides you with that interactive effect. \n- CGI (Common Gateway Interface) Scripts: A script is basically like a text file with very specific structure, which executes just like a program. We do not think this is the best way to make a web page look very interactive. It's very hard to style the text file at will. \n- PHP (Hypertext Processor): If you don't have a big background in computer science, PHP might be the easiest language you can use. But it is very hard to make a dynamic web page with PHP. \nYou should create a Web page to demonstrate the Trial-level eligibility that you generated about the patient and the clinical trial. It should have links to show the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the clinical trial.\nYou can use HTML and scripting languages to make the interactive effect you want to demonstrate. It would be helpful to use a scripting language such as PHP, Perl or Python which is much more object-oriented, and allows you to use a wide range functions available from the Internet.\n[TASK] Task 2 \n[TASK] Please think about the following topics and expand them as much as you like.

Recent studies have shown that neurotensin affects neuropeptide Y release from enteroendocrine cells. In the present study, we addressed the mechanism by which neurotensin activates the enterochromaffin cell line, KRJD-10.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examined the effect of the neurotensin receptor antagonist, N-acyl-11-hydroxy-5,10-dihydroxy-2,4,6,8,12-hexamethylhexadecanamide on neurotensin-induced Ca2+ mobilization by performing spectrofluorimetry on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The antagonist also inhibited neurotensin-stimulated neuropeptide Y release.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPretreatment of the cells with N-acyl-11-hydroxy-5,10-dihydroxy-2,4,6,8,12-hexamethylhexadecanamide significantly suppressed the Ca2+ signals induced by an EC50 of neurotensin.

Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) has been reported to reduce the synthesis of IL-27. Herein, we hypothesize that IL-27R-mediated signaling in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) is modulated by CSE. Using murine lymphoid R1-E cells transfected with the human IL-27R\u03b1 (hIL-27R\u03b1), we confirmed that IL-27 induced JAK1/STAT1 and JAK1/STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby demonstrating an IL-27 response. Further, using murine lymphoid cells transfected with the hIL-27R\u03b1 and gp130 subunits, we confirmed that IL-27 induced IL-27R-mediated signaling responses. To investigate the role of gp130 in IL-27R-mediated signaling in HBECs, these cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the hIL-27Ra and gp130 subunits. In the HBECs transfected with these two subunits, IL-27 induced JAK1/STAT1 and JAK1/STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, as in the R1-E cells transfected with only the hIL-27Ra. Further, IL-27 induced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as IP-10 and RANTES cytokine production. These results suggested that a human IL-27R complex containing the hIL-27Ra and gp130 subunits is generated in HBECs.

We included archived cervical cytologies from women without history of HPV or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of <CIN1 in this study. This is a historical cohort and all cases were originally diagnosed \u22656 years ago. We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect the E6/E7 genes of HPV, and measured the level of immune cell markers, including CD4, CD68, CD63, CD8, CD16, and CD147 (EMMPRIN) with tissue microarray. We evaluated the association of CD4 with CIN stages and CD16+ and CD14 with invasive carcinoma stages, and examined their associations with viral load. We recruited a total of 220 cases: 30 normal, 109 with CIN1, and 81 with invasive carcinomas. Both the viral load and the percentage of CD16+ neutrophils in tumor nests were significantly increased, while CD14+ tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) was significantly decreased, as lesions progressed from normal to invasive lesions.

The association between PH and COVID-19 infection is still not fully determined. Methods and patients We enrolled all patients with PH who were diagnosed between July and October 2020. Clinical, demographic, laboratory data, and the follow-up outcomes were retrospectively collected and analysed. Results Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study. Fifteen patients were tested positive with COVID-19 and died after the infection. There were no significant differences between the COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative group in demographic data except diabetes and lower extremity oedema. The median baseline mPAP at the time of the out-door visitation was 30 and 32 mmHg (p = 0.7) in COVID-19 positive group and COVID-19 negative group, respectively. In the COVID-19-negative group, the median baseline 6MWD was 257 m (range 101-374m), and the 24-month mPAP increased from 29 to 36 mmHg (p = 0.03). In the COVID-19-positive group, the median baseline 6MWT was 248 m (range 101-331m), and the 24-month mPAP increased from 35 to 47 mmHg (p = 0.001).

Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method does not use a complicated process for feature generation. We only use a simple set of inclusion and exclusion factors as raw features for clinic trial eligibility assessment. In addition, the most unique aspect of the proposed method is it provides a decision-making scheme based on a combination of multiple clinical trial notes and the inclusion and exclusion factors. To assess a given clinical trial eligibility decision, the proposed method generates a distribution function of eligible scores by a number of previous patient notes. We utilize the function to evaluate the eligibility based on the patient note.\n\n\n# Conclusion\nThe proposed method allows to easily incorporate newly generated trials by creating appropriate distributions of the assessing scores to predict eligibility in real-time. Experiment results on clinical trial assessment data show that the proposed framework is robust.\n\n# Related Work\nMost state-of-the-art methods to assess clinical trial eligibility are based on a complex process involving feature generation, feature selection, and the decision-making strategies.

This is a part of the assignment to the first week of the course where students do a group project called 'Patient Note'. You'll work on the recruitment criteria part of the assignment in groups of two and one of your teammates should also help you with this task. This is a short assignment and will only need to be finished in one week.\n\nThis is what you are going to do:\nLet's go over what has been discussed regarding the task of recruitment criteria. Your task is to check the patient not according to trial-level eligibility, but rather into categories of recruitment criteria. As we went over, recruitment criteria can be assessed as binary as well as trinary. Binary means, that a research subject either does or does not fulfill the criteria. If they do, the first part of the recruitment criteria can be denoted with the number 1. If they do not fulfill a specific criterion, this is marked with the number 0. Trinary means a research subject can fulfill no, one, or multiple criteria. The assessment has the same structure as binary scoring, but it has 3 possible values instead of 2. The number 1 marks the criteria is fulfilled, the number 0 marks the criteria is not fulfilled, and the number 2 marks that multiple criteria are fulfilled.\nThere are ten criteria in total. First, let us go over in detail each one. As we went over, these should represent: a) demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity); b) medical history [history of other diseases]; c) medicines and treatments taken; d) clinical findings; e) diagnostic procedures; f) clinical tests; g) diagnostic results; h) treatments implemented; i) therapeutics taken; j) adverse reactions recorded.\nThe assessment of all these criteria should be done one-by-one and the number one, number zero, or number two should be noted. For example, let us look at the first criterion. The criteria is 'age'. We will see several age categories. The age of 0 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and so on until the patient reaches the age of",

Such early detection is often hampered by atypical (untypical, nonclassic, difficult to detect) clinical manifestations of depression in elderly and senile patients. Thus, there is a need for the development of special screening test of depression for the elderly and senile patients.

We considered pathologic vertebral fracture to occur, therefore vertebroplasty and osteoplasty were performed after chemotherapy. Histopathologic examination detected a poorly differentiated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Although there are few reports, vertebral metastasis of NHL should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of pathologic fracture of vertebroplasty in order to avoid misdiagnosis.<EOD> S100 protein levels as markers of glia activation and astroglial and vimentin protein levels as indicators",

The emerging role of interfering with the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 pathway in the inflammatory process and the modulation of the cellular immune response in autoimmunity have encouraged investigators to explore these therapies in patients with SLE, thus increasing the possible side effects.

Adverse events are unwanted health effects in people who have been exposed to a drug or vaccine. The risk of adverse events varies across drugs and is determined by age of patient, drug indication and dosage. Thus, every drug has one or more adverse events. Some adverse events require urgent medical care. Thus, it is very important to distinguish urgent adverse events from other adverse events.\n\n## Adverse event data is represented in CSV format\n\nThe adverse event data is represented as the following two samples (i.e., adverse event information):\n\nEvent_num  event_name group_id group_value event_location group_location event_type\n         1.1109110121 2119 pn2121 1  right_eye 1 urgent (1: yes; 2: no) 2  (1): (2):\n\nFirst, you should determine each drug by taking into account the ID in the `group_id` column.

We did not consider how a model should be optimized for a\n      specific clinical trial. Since a model usually has many different parameters, one may wonder which parameters to\n      optimize. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on the goal,\n      a model and model parameters can be optimized using different criteria or metrics. For instance, a model could be optimized by its predictive power (e.g. ROC AUC) or the goodness of fit to patient note and/or the clinical trial inclusion criteria. In addition, different types of data might need to be optimized: patient notes could be optimized in terms of prediction power while clinical trial eligibility criteria could be optimized in terms of the number of false negatives and false positives. We hope that this paper will inspire more discussions related to the choice of optimization metrics and the criteria to optimize parameters. \n  \n    2. Even though the 2016 Drug Repurposing Competition focused on\n      drug-disease pairs, any task that required judgments could benefit from an approach like ours. For instance, another 2016 dataset contained judgments about a particular patient note and the symptoms of the patient.

The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge about sleep profiles in PoTS-like population, particularly when evaluated using polysomnography data. We recruited 13 PoTS-like and 18 healthy subjects; PoTS-like group was identified using questionnaire data (i.e., PoTS-like symptoms).

This technique has been successfully used for simple cholelithiasis and other conditions. But this is a rare practice of using TUs to perform laparoscopic nephrectomy, thyroidectomy, gastrectomyand the treatment of gallolithiasis. In this technique, there is no need to separate the gallbladder from the gallbladder bed or make a subumbilical incision; therefore, it is more advantageous than other laparoscopic techniques and patients are able to return to work earlier.\nThe gallstone remains after cholecystectomy is a rare complication that, in many cases, requires conversion to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and is associated with high costs, extended stay at the hospital as well as increased risk of morbidity. On the other hand, it is possible to perform a laparoscopic or laparotomy procedure in order to remove the gallstones.\nIntraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of different pathologies, including the identification of stones, neoplasm, hematoma, fluid collections, etc. It is a technique that avoids performing new exploration and decreases the rate of multiple exploration. Despite the low-frequency use of IOUS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it can be a helpful tool with several advantages, such as quick",

It is in this context that we seek to test an effective strategy for reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office practices. Our overall objective is to identify an effective and efficient strategy for decreasing the contribution of primary care clinicians to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the community and to disseminate widely those strategies found to be effective and sustainable.~We hypothesize that implementation of a clinician decision support system, with an active education component, will reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office practices. Our hypothesis is based on the premise that most inappropriate prescribing is the result of multiple factors that include difficulty in distinguishing a benign, self-limited viral infection from a more serious bacterial infection; overdiagnosis of a bacterial infection in cases where there is clinical uncertainty as to the true nature of the illness; and constraints on the time available for clinicians to explain to patients the nature of the illness and the reasons an antibiotic is not indicated",

Measurements of the maximum tensile force (Tfmax) were made, before and after treatment, on freshly excised human abdominal skin. Skins, attached by their epidermal component to aluminum rings, were subjected to different degrees of surface damage. Folding an intact skin caused a considerable increase in skin surface hydrophobicity, corresponding to a 2- to 10-fold decrease in Tfmax. Tfmax was found to correlate exponentially with the surface area of the skin. The skin tensiometer proved to be a sensitive instrument for the assessment of skin surface hydrophobicity.<EOD> Characteristics of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 in a nationwide survey in the early stage of the pandemic in Korea\n\nKey summary pointsAim To assess baseline characteristics and clinical courses of the early confirmed case of nonhospitalized adult COVID-19 patients.

The diet of these two groups included different amounts of antioxidants. Our analysis indicated significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of n-6 (\u03c9-6) FAs contained in the different biomarkers: the contribution of n-6 FAs was greater in plasma compared with phospholipids. This indicates the importance of studying the dietary status before assessing oxidation markers. The results of the study confirm that oxidation biomarkers of plasma contain both antioxidants (such as vitamin E) and pro-oxidants. In addition, they indicate that the biomarkers\u2019 levels depend also on lifestyle factors, such as smoking, and physical activity, and not solely on diet.<EOD> A Novel, Nondetectable Cisplatin Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil in Pancreatic Cancer Cells",

During this time 38 pregnant women taking oral contraceptives were found to have infants with cardiovascular malformations, for a reported risk of 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.5\u201316.7) greater than that in the general population. However, five of these cases had conditions that predisposed them to cardiac disease and three cases had a diagnosis of mild mental retardation. After the diagnoses of these seven women were excluded, the risk of cardiovascular malformations among pregnant women exposed continuously to oral contraceptives was approximately the same as that among the general population (relative risk, 1.0). This does not indicate that oral contraceptive use is not an aetiologic factor, only that the reported risk in pregnant women compared with the general population may be biased. The reported risk of craniofacial defects, meningomyelocele, and abdominal wall defects was increased, but not consistently above the expected risk.<EOD> Effect of Methyl Ester Oil on Egg Production and Blood Parameters in Lohmann Brown Hens at High Stock Density during Summer Heat\n\nA 6-week experiment was conducted to study the effects of dietary methyl ester oil (MEO) at high stocking density (HSD; 150 hens/m 2 ) during the summer heat on egg production and blood parameter indices in Lohmann Brown laying hens.

Eighteen patients with 24 implants in edentulous maxilla or in partially edentulous atrophic anterior mandibles were selected and treated. A total of 24 prefabricated ceramic-metal copings (Nobel Biocare) were made at the moment of the implant insertion, and another 24 prefabricated zirconia-metal copings (Rhein 83, Incoris Fioua), were fabricated during the implant follow-up time. Implant site, length, diameter, implants placed (straight or angulated), number and kind of complications were recorded. The complication rate was 28.57% and complications registered comprised misalignment, misfit, rotation, and loosening of the provisional crown during the surgery. No statistically significant difference was found in the complication rate between the different restoration materials (p = 0.091). Considering the different restoration materials, we observed that after 15.5 months the only statistically significant difference was between resin crown (100%) and zirconia-metal copings (0%) (p = 0.01424).<EOD> .\nIn rats given diet containing (15NH4)2",

To address the role of RF in the local tissues, we analyzed the influence of IgG human monoclonal RF on the response of monocytes isolated from healthy subjects to toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or 4 (TLR4) ligands in the presence of the intracellular inflammasome signaling inhibitor glybenclamide (GBC). The presence of human monoclonal RF enhanced production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in monocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, Pam3CSK4 and zymosan. Cytokine production was higher in the presence of higher concentrations of RF preparation and higher TLR ligand concentration. This increase was dependent on caspase-1 enzymatic activity. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 subunit and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) mRNA in monocytes were higher upon stimulation with ligands and RF. GBC diminished both RF-mediated increase in MCP-1/CCL2 mRNA and concentration of NF-\u03baBp65 subunit in cytoplasm while it did not block MCP-1/CCL2 protein release. Our results suggest that RF may potentiate cytokine and chemokine production via IL-1\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB signaling induced by TLR ligands.\n\n# Introduction\nRheumatoid factor (RF) is a self-reactive IgM antibody produced by B cells.

The anatomy of the affected area as well as the angiographic characteristics of the area may vary in patients with this condition. Methods\u2014 We present the radiologic findings in 4 patients (age, 23\u201362 years; male/female, 3/1) with middle meningeal artery occlusions and discuss the possible mechanisms of the condition. Results\u2014 All 4 patients had a history of trauma or carotid intimal injury. Of these, 3 had a history of an extradural hematoma. In all patients, the occluded middle meningeal artery was a long trunk vessel, whereas the ipsilateral supraclinoid branches were either hypoplastic or absent. The supraclinoid branches supplied the ipsilateral anterior choroidal artery in all of our patients. Conclusions\u2014 The anatomy of the affected area showed consistency. Therefore, the occluded middle cerebral artery trunk can be the result of the compression of the affected middle meningeal artery by an ectopic perforator arising from the middle meningeal artery or the traumatized intimal wall of the middle cerebral artery causing dissection. However, the origin of the extradural hematoma cannot be detected by angiography of the middle meningeal artery.<EOD> Effects of oviduct-specific gene deletion on female and male fertility and reproductive outcome\nMice lacking the oviduct-specific secretory glycoprotein (O",

According to the clinical experience, symptoms like fever and tachycardia might be caused by other diseases, e.g., URTI. However, in this case, URTI is also less probable at this time, so the clinical decision will be more difficult.\n\n[C1] The first thing is to determine what diseases might be in the patient's differential. The first thing we'll do is to take a look at the chest x-ray. In this case, we're trying to make a diagnosis on a patient with a fever who had gone to Colorado and we've got a chest x-ray, so that's a positive, we know that we were probably dealing with a disease affecting the lungs, there are no other symptoms that we need to be aware of. We can start from the differential. We should consider any symptoms like rash and sore throat and muscle pain. That gives us an idea what the differential is. So, we can remove anything that doesn't match and we might also see that we need to do a physical examination that is more to rule out the disease or make sure that the disease doesn't require any special care, like a tuberculosis screen so we'll start thinking along those lines.\n\n[C2] So, our first diagnosis is probably Tick borne disease. In terms of clinical presentation, I think his initial concern was going from Colorado, then he didn't have any symptoms going there. He returned probably with some kind of flu-like symptoms, and then he got other symptoms like chills and cough, but, overall, the patient is pretty healthy for going to Colorado. So, those are the clinical presentation, and our clinic, we did not see the chest x-ray. However, we do have, for example,",

However, I would like to see an explanation of 'prior to the onset of fever and cough'. What does this mean? Does it mean the fever was 39C when patient was on vacation, or does it mean that when they returned from vacation, they started coughing and had fever.\n\n[INST] Thank you for pointing out our misinterpretation. Our team assumed that the fever was a new problem, which started when the patient returned from vacation. It may be better to not have the word \"on vacation\", and only indicate that the fever started when he was home.\n\n### Question 10: Overall, I think when considering the clinical trial, it is important to consider the inclusion criteria relating to travel history. Are the patients eligible to enter the study if they have no history of travel abroad? What if the travel history is within the past 2 years, is that sufficient to exclude the patient? In addition, I wonder if the case study would benefit from some references to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This may be more helpful than trying to relate this to the patient in the scenario.\n[INST] Thank you for pointing out the lack of specification for the travel history in our original case study.

Immune and tumor\u2010associated markers were also quantified. Irradiation induced several changes in miR levels, with a significant increase in miR\u201021. These changes were accompanied by an augmentation in the expression of the immune and tumor\u2010associated markers tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010), and programmed death\u2010ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1), in addition to a decrease in tumor necrosis factor\u2010related apoptosis\u2010induced ligand (TRAIL).

        "output": "<EOD> The Role of Arachidonic Acid-Dependent Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 in Skeletal Muscle Fiber-Type Switching\n\nSkeletal muscle is highly adaptive to alteration of contractile activity, being capable of changing the proportion of fibers in a process involving complex cellular and molecular events known as muscle fiber type switching. Mammalian skeletal muscle fibers may be classified as Types I, IIa, IIx (also known as IIb), or IIb/d, based on the predominant sarcomeric structure, enzymatic activity, and functional properties of the skeletal muscle fibers. The type I fiber is characterized by a slower contraction velocity and lower capability to generate force, which is associated with a greater mitochondrial density, higher endurance, and glycogen accumulation, which allows this type of muscle fiber to be predominant in endurance exercise. On the other hand, the type IIx/d is characterized by a greater capacity to generate force but is slower in contraction velocity, a feature that allows this type of muscle fiber to dominate in maximal force tasks. In this scenario, Type I and IIx/d fibers comprise the majority of myofibers existing in untrained rodents, whereas the proportion of IIa fibers is significantly lower. However, the composition of muscle fibers can be altered by endurance or strength training, which can shift the fiber composition from IIa/x/d to IIa/slow. Although an increase in IIx/d fibers was not observed, the switch from a mainly IIx/d fiber composition to IIa/slow fibers was accompanied by an increase in fast glycolytic muscle activity. In addition to the shift in muscle phenotype, endurance and strength training may influence metabolism and lead to a significant remodeling of fiber composition, which can be accomplished through the transcriptional regulation of several genes related to either fast (IIx) and slow (IIa) muscle fibers, as well as hypertrophy signaling pathways. Despite the fact that different animal models and training schemes may change the exact effects on muscle fiber content, the understanding of molecular pathways that occur",

This review focuses on the role of MRI in these phases of lung cancer management. MRI has a high potential value in lung cancer due to its ability to generate both high-resolution anatomic and functional images. Contrast enhanced MRI shows the presence, nature and degree of any mediastinal or extrathoracic disease more accurately than either computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET), which are more adequate for nodule characterization. MRI therefore appears to be a powerful non-ionising lung cancer imaging modality. Nonetheless, we should not forget that MRI's greatest strengths are still limited to the thoracic region, so in clinical practice it may only be used in a complementary fashion to CT and PET. Moreover, the implementation of MRI in large scale studies is difficult as the high cost and low availability of MRI prevents the possibility of this modality being available in most centers and healthcare systems.KeywordsMagnetic resonance imaging; tumor-node-metastasis staging; lung cancer .

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and accuracy of a new method whereby the water activity of foods was calculated from analysis of the water removed by ultrafiltration through a 250-nm Nuclepore membrane using a MicroProbe pressure bomb and digital meter. Test solutions were prepared from sucrose, 1,2-propanediol, sodium chloride, and ammonium nitrate at various concentrations known to range across the water activity scale. All solutions were subjected to three 250-ml ultrafiltration cycles and the average solute concentrations after each cycle were analyzed with a Coulter HPLC system. This allowed accurate calculation of the initial solution water activities. Water activity values for the test solutions were found to be reasonably accurate and to be independent of pH. In addition, the pH of a 5% aqueous suspension of sugar beet pulp was analyzed to determine residual water activity, but no solute contribution to the measurement of water activity could be detected. When 80 samples from the frozen food sections of a local grocery store were subjected to Nuclepore ultrafiltration, the values obtained correlated strongly (R = 0.907) with an established standard technique. These results demonstrate that the new method is both safe and accurate for water activity measurement in foods and is sufficiently simple to allow field use.<EOD> .\nThis paper presents the results of a study carried out on 285 infants of the City of Rio de Janeiro. Among those infants, 194 had no detectable serum viral markers, while 54 and 34 showed HBsAg and anti-HBe or anti-HBe and anti-HBc, respectively. In all subjects, there was concomitant presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe and anti-HBc. The children infected perinatally showed a 90% seroconversion in the first five years, and a positive correlation was demonstrated between age of the infants when anti-HBc was first detected and the time of sero",

Materials and Methods: This study enrolled participants who had pathologically confirmed intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with metastatic tumors of the bone, liver, lungs, or lymph nodes. All participants received capecitabine 1500 mg/m 2 twice daily and escalating doses of intravenous emodin (25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg/m 2 ) for 14 days in each cycle. The emodin was started at 25 mg/m 2 /d after the 7th cycle with a capecitabine 1500 mg/m 2 twice daily. The emodin dose was increased by 25 mg/m 2 each time after the end of the first cycle until the appearance of DLT or MTD. DLT was defined as any nonhematologic or hematologic toxicity that was possibly or probably related to the study treatment. The MTD was the highest dose of emodin that could be administered to 1/6 of participants without DLT. A pharmacokinetic study and 16S rRNA analysis were performed in cycles 1 and 2. Tumor response was evaluated every 2 months. Results: The study treated 19 participants at 5 dose levels. None of the participants reached the MTD dose.

The first column (patient) has a very long string that is difficult to handle, so this column represents the patient, as if it had become a new row. Columns `Psychological_injury`, `Physical_injury`, `Socio_Environmental_injury`, and `Eligible` are converted to categorical variables. `Socio_Environmental_injury` variable in the `Socio_Environmental_injury` column is used as the input factor to the `factor` function. `Psychiatric_injury` variable of the `Psychiatric_injury` column is used as the output factor of the `predict` function, not as the input factor. In the output factor, the factorization is converted from factors into a numeric value, and the numeric value is displayed in the MKL output table. That is, it is to be assigned to each row with one number rather than factor (either 0 or 1). This is done to facilitate the creation of the clinical trial eligibility table. This is not the output you expect in the MKL result table.

The metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrogen sulfide, sulfite, and methanethiol have been described, and growth experiments have revealed a preference for substrate depletion and the formation of the corresponding aromatic methyl disulfides. The genome of this bacterium contains genes encoding enzymes catalyzing two different pathways for methyl transfer, one to methenyl-and the other to methylcobalamin. However, genetic modifications of the sulfur carrier enzymes of these pathways failed to change the preference for methylation of the aromatic methyl disulphides. In the present study, we applied a genome mining approach to identify redox partners potentially participating in these heterologous desulfurization processes. Two new members of the DMSO reductase family enzymes, DmsC and DmsB, were identified with the same genetic context as genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate respiration. However, the genes encoding this putative DMSO reductase cofactor biosynthesis pathway, dsrD, dsrC, and dsrB, exhibited transcript levels of 0.4%-0.7% of the total annotated genes. In addition, it was observed that transcription of the previously described pathway for sulfur dissimilation was stimulated when dddA, encoding the hydrogenase of the sulfur reductase, was blocked. This suggested that transcription from both pathways was not mutually exclusive. Overall, the methylation efficiency of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway was shown to be lower than 15%.

This study compared the effects of inhibitory training, anxiety reduction and traditional (task-response) training on spurious response frequency in persons with moderate to severe mental retardation. An anxiety reduction procedure was designed to provide more than the traditional type of reward for appropriate responding. However, neither the anxiety reduction procedure nor inhibitory training reduced spurious responses to a statistically significant degree. Reduction in anxiety level was not directly related to a reduction in spurious responses. Results support the use of inhibitory training and anxiety reduction procedures as preventative procedures but suggest that anxiety reduction and inhibitory training did not effectively counteract the effects of verbal instructional reversal of responses.<EOD> Acute hemodynamic effects of the non-peptide angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan in man.\n1.

So when a user loads the script, the script will be used to parse the input_data and save it in a variable which the user has created at the beginning of the script and output_data is an empty string.

In the reproductive system and in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, oxytocin is an important neurotransmitter that facilitates E2 action. Interestingly, sex-specific differences in the expression levels of oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) have been documented in several organs, including the brain. In zebrafish, in situ hybridization (ISH) of oxt and oxtr genes revealed sexual dimorphism in oxt and oxtr expression in the brain, whereas sexual dimorphism was not observed for in situ (IS) ISH of agarose sections for brain and heart. The present study used ISH to characterize oxtr gene expression in the brain of wild type and homozygous zebrafish mutant line fshr (follicle-stimulating hormone receptor knockout), which do not have gonads and circulating sex steroids to evaluate whether OXTR expression is induced by direct action of E2 in the brain. The results showed that IS E2 treatment, but not systemic (ip) E2 treatment, decreased oxtr IS expression in the brain of the homozygous fshr mutants, while increased OXTR expression was observed in the ovary in response to systemic E2 administration. In the intestine, brain, and heart, IS E2 treatment increased oxtr ISH, whereas systemic administration of E2 decreased oxtr ISH. The present study, therefore, suggests that the effects of E2 on OXTR expression levels in a sexually dimorphic-organ, such as the brain, may involve direct interaction with the OXTR in the target organ and that the effects of systemic E2 administration on OXTR expression levels may be indirect and require the presence of the HPG axis, probably by hormonal feedback.\n\n# Introduction\nEstradiol (E2) is the most important female gonadal hormone in promoting reproduction through a multitude of",

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions consisting of stimuli designed to clinically treat patients with myofascial pain (MP), in addition to the routine rehabilitation prescribed for the treatment of this condition. Material and methods. Patients with MP (N = 56) and painful conditions outside the myofascial referral zone (N = 10) were randomly assigned to three groups: routine rehabilitation only (Group I), routine rehabilitation plus cognitive motor training, massage therapy, and hydrotherapy (Group II), and routine rehabilitation plus iontophoresis (Group III). The outcome measures included a numerical pain rating scale, pressure pain threshold, goniometry, pressure algometry, disability, and quality of life. Participants were evaluated at baseline and after 6 weeks of therapy. The Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the groups at baseline. The Friedman test was used to compare the measures of the three groups before and after the rehabilitation program, and the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the differences between groups when necessary. Results. All groups showed a significant reduction in pain intensity after treatment. Differences in the pressure pain threshold were only significant among Group I. Groups II and III had similar decreases in disability and increases in quality of life. For the secondary outcome measure, Group III showed more improvements in active motion than Group I.

It is unclear how the community's species diversity is maintained under stressful and changing environment. Using longitudinal profiles from >900 samples collected over 2 years from 7 healthy subjects, we investigated how microbial taxa interact at different time-scales to form self-sustaining modules (clusters) that maintain species diversity. At the highest time scale, the gut community is largely dominated by 93 bacterial phyloclusters, each comprised of taxa that show co-clustering in time. We found that the gut microbiome is structurally robust with respect to the loss of phylotypes-the community is more resilient to the loss of less abundant phyloclusters. The microbiome can withstand the loss of taxonomic groups within phylotypes up to a ratio of 50-70%, where the community recovers quickly. This microbiome resilience allows the community to maintain an intrinsic microbial diversity through a series of co-clustering states. The community evolves towards states with higher relative abundances of health-promoting phyloclusters within time windows (2-14 days) of clinical states such as bowel preparation or antibiotics intake. Notably, the community also tends to regenerate with a microbiome profile with lowered relative abundance of these healthpromoting bacteria soon after the clinical state is resolved. As a result, the entire community is better buffered for potential perturbations during this recovery period. Our results show that the gut microbiome community is a complex self-organizing system that responds to stressful events and recovers with new structures of varying diversity (and stability) depending on the nature and duration of perturbations.\n\n# Introduction\nThe human gut microbiota is a complex system comprised of trillions of microbes in symbiotic relationships with their host. Understanding how the community maintains a diverse composition of microorganisms and remains stable in health is a challenging problem [bib_ref]  Dynamics of",

Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is a well-known inhibitor of necroptosis. However, whether Nec-1 is neuroprotective under retinal ischemic injury remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of Nec-1 on retinal ischemia. Retinal ischemia was induced by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which resulted in severe optic nerve damage and RGC death. Necrostatin-1 (100 mM) and analogues Nec-1",

Here, you should be able to differentiate those factors that enable participants to be involved in a trial, and evaluate the eligibility of a patient for a particular clinical trial (Trial-level eligibility). The patient has been diagnosed with NEC, which was treated according to the \"inclusion criteria\" for many trials (Inclusion criteria). The patient is a preterm infant, which is an \"inclusion\" factor that may not be applicable to all patients in a trial, but is a factor that does not \"exclude\" patients from participating in trials. In terms of an age restriction, it is not an \"exclusion\" factor, as clinical trials including infant participants are usually not required to specify an upper age limit. Instead, age restrictions may include the minimum and maximum age of the target population, i.e., the age that applies according to the trial's enrolment criteria. For further assessment of a patient's eligibility, additional information needs to be checked. In the case presented in the trial note, the patient has not yet completed breastfeeding and was recently on oral feedings. These patient characteristics are both \"exclusion\" factors in clinical trials. As shown in the clinical trial note, the patient has a history of multiple blood product transfusions, including red blood cell (RBC) products. This type of transfusion is considered an \"exclusion\" factor from the trial. In line with the trial's inclusion criteria, this patient lacks pre-operative feeding, and had an upper gastrointestinal (GI) ultrasound performed at the patient's previous hospital (exclusion factor related to diagnostic tests).

The cellular content of the AR, detected during HL-60 differentiation with TPA into monocytes or monocyte-like cells, increased 21+/-0.6 fold on day 5 after TPA treatment, followed by a further decline towards undetectable levels on day 9. No increase was found in the expression of the AR in HL-60 cells with other differentiating agents such as alpha-interferon, retinoic acid or dimethylsulphoxide. AR mRNA, detected by RT-PCR, increased significantly by the 3rd day after TPA addition, consistent with the time of increased AR protein in the differentiated cells. The androgen-stimulated synthesis of PSA in HL-60 cells was also found to increase to a higher steady state level after treatment with the monocyte-differentiating agent TPA. This finding adds another possible avenue of investigation to the effects of the AR in the differentiation of human cell line",

The aim of this study is to assess the role of social media, and explore its impact on anxiety, fear, trust, and compliance during the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia using an online-based questionnaire on the socio-demographic information and social media (SM) were distributed in June-September 2020. The level of pandemic-related anxiety and fear, trust in information, and compliance were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with compliance. Results Data were gathered from 969 participants. Only 30.49% of the subjects agreed on the reliability of available information. Social media was considered to be the main source of information (58.9%); however, only 38.5% of the participants agreed to the level of trust they received from the SM platforms. The SM were considered the main source of COVID-19 updates for 77.5%, however, only 46.50% agreed on the accuracy of the information provided. The higher rate of compliance was among individuals older than 50 years and was 64.3% trustworthy of the SM, and 80.2% were afraid while using SM frequently. Conclusion Our results confirmed the positive impact of SM in disseminating the precautions, prevention measures, and up-to-date information regarding disease control and treatment. However, it was identified that many individuals did not trust the SM platforms, which hindered their role to inform and educate the population about the disease and available measures. This study emphasized the urgent need to enhance the role of SM in crisis communication. In this respect, the main recommendation is to develop a national social media policy to ensure the quality of the disseminated information and guarantee the reliability of online sources.Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations",

Recent studies suggest that SHPS\u20101, a membrane receptor for protein\u2010tyrosine phosphatase 1C, plays crucial roles in tumor suppression. However, the role of SHPS\u20101 in human hepatocellular cancer is not yet known. Thus, we transduced SHPS\u20101 into two human hepatocellular cancer cell lines and evaluated its effect on the growth of these cultured cells in vitro and in vivo by using cell proliferation assays and nude mouse allograft models. We also evaluated the effect on cancer cell metastasis by using mouse lung colonization assays and tumor\u2010induced angiogenesis of nude mouse allograft models. Increased expression of SHPS\u20101 by SHPS\u20101 transduction reduced the growth of cultured human hepatocellular cancer cells and their metastasis to the lung. Furthermore, SHPS\u20101\u2010transduced cells exhibited reduced tumor size in allograft models, along with reduced tumor\u2010induced angiogenesis. SHPS\u20101 transduction also induced the upregulation of CD44, caveolin\u20101, and E\u2010cadherin and decreased the protein levels of \u03b1\u2010SMA (alpha\u2010smooth muscle actin), vimentin, uPAR (urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator receptor), and CD44v6 in cell lysates and culture supernatants.

Clinical heterogeneity of SLE is mainly a product of variations in immunologic pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence show that T cells and antibodies play a critical role in SLE. Indeed, anti-DNA autoantibodies in SLE belong to the IgG class, and CD4+ T cells play a key role in the expansion of autoantibodies. Therefore, therapeutic modulations in T-cell proliferation have shown some promise in SLE. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in addition to cytokine stimulated proliferation, T cells can proliferated independent of cytokine stimulation through immune complex presentation, costimulatory molecules or antigen presentation.\nRhematoid arthritis (RA) is a multi-systemic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis with a high degree of mortality and morbidity. Proliferation of synoviocytes and infiltration to the synovium of CD4+ T cells and macrophages, is directly responsible for RA. In patients with RA, a considerable number of CD4 T cells are activated. Therefore, understanding of the T cell hyperactivation in autoimmune diseases is needed to understand the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and to offer novel targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that T lymphocytes are involved in immune suppression of RA. This suppressive effect is a CD4+CD25+ T lymphocyte dependent mechanism and is mediated by a TGF-b-producing CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte subset. Therefore, targeting the suppressive CD4+CD25+ T cells may help in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.\nHowever, the mechanisms by which inhibitory signals modulate T cell responses remain incompletely understood, as do the role of costimulation in controlling auto-reactive T cells activation. In this study we will investigate role of DcR3-induced T cell activation",

The method should use the information and clinical data of a patient note. We designed a neural network with 3 layers (196/196/22 layers) and 22 hidden units that could predict the eligibility.\n\nTo identify the clinical trials and patient notes, we implemented the following method. By utilizing information from the clinical trial registration websites and clinical data, the network first predicted the target, i.e., either yes or no, of a clinical trial as `Target: yes` or Trial-level eligibility: `1) Would refer this patient for this clinical trial` to determine the eligibility of the patient, i.e., `patient-level eligibility: 2) Yes/Trial-level eligibility: 1) Yes/Target: Yes/Trial-level eligibility: 1) Yes`;  or `patient-level eligibility: 1) No/Trial-level eligibility: 2) No/Target: No/Trial-level eligibility: 2) Yes`; or `patient-level eligibility: 1) No/Trial-level eligibility: 2) No/Target: No/Trial-level eligibility: 2) No`. Because patients might not be eligible to the clinical trial, the network also predicted the patient-level eligibility for the clinical trial. If the eligibility was `1) No`, the program would be terminated. We also added a feature that if the trial had a factor which was absent on the patient, the eligibility of the patient would be always `1) No` regardless of other factors in the patient.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the method, we used two patient notes from the lupus clinics. The first patient was highly likely to be eligible to the trial while the second patient was likely to be ineligible. The network predicted the result of 36 clinical trials as in the test data; 32 clinical trials had the same eligibility results as ours, giving",

The incidence of aneurysmal rupture after a successful anatomical reconstruction is about 35% within the 2 years. Although anastomotic site is anatomically different, it may contribute to mortality or to some kind of complication. Therefore the aim of the study was to determine whether the suppression of inflammatory response during surgery can affect anastomotic healing in rats. In the present study we used NSAID and NdAA, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nForty five Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: group I: anastomosis, group II: anastomosis and acetylsalicylic acid administration, and group III: anastomosis and acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen administration. The animals were sacrificed on the 60th day after the surgery. The specimens were processed histologically. Then, the morphometric parameters were determined using a computer program and the numerical results were statistically processed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the control group the lumen of the vessel increased and at every turn a new layer formed. On the other hand, in group II the lumen of the vessel decreased at every turn. However, the statistical analysis confirmed the effect of acetylsalicylic acid on the histopathological picture, but the values showed significant difference only in the 15th day post-operation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe histopathological examination revealed that acetylsalicylic acid administration after anastomosis decreased reorganization of the vessel wall; however, it had no effect on reepith",

A 4 cm incision was made in the lateral orbital wall along the lower rim. The lateral wall was opened and was completely elevated. The orbital contents were separated and the bony structure was exposed and was removed along the orbital floor and the orbital roof. The orbital floor was paved with a titanium mesh plate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean length of the surgery was 87.7 (65 - 110) minutes. The post-operative hospital stay was 6 (3 - 8.5) days.

One of the best characterized systems is provided by the bark beetles. These insects have a remarkable biology and serve as excellent models for host-parasite interactions. These studies have focused on several species of the genus Dendroctonus: D. ponderosae, D. brevicomis, D. rufipennis. This research has uncovered one of the most extensive arrays of MHC alleles reported to date. They are organized in discrete subregions in the genome, spanning over 0.2 Mbp, located within the class III genes. In the present study we sequenced the MHC genes from two species of the genus Nicrophorus: N. tattersalli and N. investigator, which exhibit completely different behaviours with respect to the bark beetles. We identified a single MHC class III region in the haploid genome of Nicrophorus. Sequence evidence suggests that, although the MHC region of tetrapods exhibits a highly conserved structure and synteny, distinct evolutionary pressures may have led to a different evolutionary scenario in the MHC genes of the Coleoptera. Indeed, the N. tattersalli MHC genes are characterized by multiple tandem arrays of variable loci within the class III region that are separated by conserved loci. The number of tandem loci exceeds that of bark beetles and is the highest reported in the class III region of all animal species. These data indicate that the MHC region is highly polymorphic within populations of the burying beetles, especially in the closely related haplotypes. This structural evolution is likely due to a combination of gene conversion, interlocus gene conversion and local gene duplication.<EOD> In vivo characterization of the infratemporal fossa and its impacts on the reconstruction with free",

To study possible aging-related changes in astrocytes, we established an in vitro model of primary cultured rat astrocytes that were examined at different ages. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the results showed that the astrocyte viability and population density were highest during the second to fourth passages. The culture medium and culture condition were optimized by examining the cell viability, proliferation rate, and apoptosis of astrocytes at different passages. These results show that the in vitro cultured rat astrocytes are a suitable cellular model for studying aging-related changes for this cell type. We have also demonstrated the presence of apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase 3 in cultured rat astrocytes stimulated with staurosporine (100 \u03bcM). In conclusion, the results revealed that different passages of rat astrocyte cultures display age-related cellular characteristics that may lead to an increased apoptosis rate in ag",

        "output": "<EOD> .\n\n The problem that occurs in analyzing data concerning marriage and divorce in France concerns the difficulty in identifying \"married\" persons. While there is no conceptual difficulty in distinguishing between married and single individuals, such a distinction is difficult to make for divorced individuals. The question remains unresolved to which data base, population, the \"population on January 1\" or \"the population as of January 1,\" to which the number of divorces or separation should be attached and in what case they should be added to the number of married persons. This conceptual question does not, however, have much consequence. The use of different data bases for the same information causes a relative understatement or overstatement of the number of divorced persons in any given period. On the other hand, the difference in statistical data bases, the population on January 1 vs. the population as of January 1, constitutes an element of bias that is only slight in magnitude and can be easily eliminated by an arithmetic correction. Another point of discussion has to do with differences in population between the two types of data bases, and for this a more sophisticated method for population evaluation has to be developed.

DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) methylates the cytidine in a single-stranded overhang at the hTR C terminus to prevent telomere elongation. We mapped the three-dimensional structures of wild type and methylated hTR using Cucurbit[7]uril (CB7)-assisted cross-linking and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. CB7 binds to the hTR terminal loop domain and prevents it from folding into an intramolecular structure. NMR spectra of cross-linked hTR samples showed the disappearance of CB7-assisted intramolecular cross-linked peaks, confirming that the folding of hTR was disrupted. CB7-assisted cross-linking demonstrated that methylation of hTR did not disrupt the folding. NMR peaks for nucleotides 45-64 were lost in the methylated hTR sample, suggesting that they are affected by methylated cytidine. DNMT3A methylation reduced the transcript half-life of hTR through",

A coronary angiography was performed which revealed a complete occlusion of the first segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The supplement did, however, not change the ratio of cecal pH to acetate concentration. The levels of acetate in the breath were well correlated to the levels of acetate in the cecal content.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn increase in RS+SF in the diet promotes the fermentation to SCFAs in the hind gut region, and reduces the transit time in small intestine. These may be mechanisms which contribute to RS+SF effects reducing serum cholesterol.<EOD> Proactive use of in-hospital and community care reduces readmissions in a hospital-based complex care transitional care model.\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study is a retrospective review of a single-centered, quality improvement program to decrease readmissions in a hospital-based complex care transitional care program.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy sites included a quaternary children's hospital, a community outpatient clinic, and an institutional pediatrics residency program, and the study period was between July 2014 and May 2015.

The innate immune system is thought to mediate this important task through the recognition of molecular patterns of microorganisms by its membrane or intracellular components. During the last 10 to 15 years, significant progress has been made in the characterization of these putative surface-associated recognition motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and those that are present on stressed or damaged cells and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In this context, the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that were first identified in invertebrates, has had a major impact on our understanding of the function of the innate immune system. During this period, TLRs were shown to be implicated in the recognition of different PAMPs or DAMPs by vertebrate cells, particularly by the antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. This review will present an overview of the recent developments in the field concerning the role of TLRs in the activation of these innate immune cells and their ability to induce adaptive immune responses.<EOD> SARS-CoV-2 and human reproduction: A clinical perspective.\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic.

In this article, we reviewed the possible roles of neurotrophins in the pathophysiology of depression. First, we introduce the concept of neurotrophic factor and present brief history of discovery on neuronal growth factors. Next, we report clinical and preclinical evidences on changes in neurotrophins in depression. Subsequently, we show the current knowledge about growth factors related to neural plasticity and depression to summarize the evidence that neurotrophins might play an important role in depression. Finally, we suggest future researches using neurotrophins to develop new antidepressants. We hypothesized that new antidepressant targeting neurotrophins may be beneficial for major depressive disorder. We hope this review help researchers understand the possible roles of neurotrophins in the pathophysiology of depression.\n\n# Introduction\nDepression, also known as Major depressive disorder (MDD) has become a major disease burden worldwide. Current studies reported that MDD affects more than 350 million people worldwide [bib_ref]  Depression-Epidemiology; risk factors and relationships between depression and chronic medical illness, Chapman [/bib_ref] .

Clinical and neuropathological findings.\nThe authors report a patient with cervical dystonia secondary to a large cerebellar infarct. The infarct involved both the hemispheres and the vermis. Neuropathological examination of the brain revealed cortical destruction in the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex with loss of a distinct corticospinal tract. No neuronal loss was observed in the contralateral precentral, central dorsal or ventral cerebellar nuclei or dentate nuclei. In addition, no evidence of pathologic involvement of the bilateral red nucleus, periaqueductal gray matter and pons was noted. These data suggest that lesions in certain parts of the premotor cortex and contralateral cerebellar cortex/nucleus might participate in the pathophysiology of cervical dystonia. The involvement of the ipsilateral motor cortex via corticospinal tract dysfunction could also participate in the initiation and evolution of this movement disorder.<EOD> A 50-Year-Old Man with Fasciculations with a Diffuse Neurofibromatosis\n\n\n\n## Clinical history\nA 50-year-old man with suspected motor neuron disease had weakness of all four limbs associated with",

The author considers the main reasons for the development of the posttraumatic syndrome as the posttraumatic changes affecting the structures of the posterior surface of the brain and the damage of cranial nerves. The technique of urgent decompression of the brain enables the quick removal of the cause of compression and the correction of the impaired microcirculation in the brain, the normalization of the level of the cerebrospinal fluid, the relief of posttraumatic arterial hypoxia which facilitate the rapid elimination of microlesions in the damaged brain.

Melanoma is particularly uncommon in Asians, probably due to genetically low levels of melanin in their tissue. Melanoma occurs most often in individuals between the ages of 30 and 50 years, usually before 40 years because most are white. There is rare incidence of pigmented lesions on the scalp, neck, trunk, penis, or the soles of the feet, which is consistent with cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), which commonly arises in pigmented areas, like in the face, arms, hands, and lower legs. Malignant melanomas of the palms and soles have some distinctive characteristics. 2 CMM usually occurs de novo, although there are also some cases of acquired malignant melanoma in which malignant melanocytes arise in a field of benign melanocytes.

Greece officially confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on the 26th of February (see Health.gr (National Public Health Organization, 2020)). The total number of cases as of September 28, 2020, was 26,490 with 565 total fatalities, while the epidemiological incidence, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was 127.7 per 100,000 population on 25 August .\nThe disease is caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to a big family of viruses that may cause illness in humans. However, it is different from the two human coronaviruses that cause mild illnesses like the common cold-the main symptom of which is a cough. According to the World Health Organization, its symptoms include fever, difficulty in breathing, and extreme fatigue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 81% of patients experience mild to moderate illnesses (CDC, 2020b). The risk of death also seems to be lower than that of the SARS coronavirus, which is also spreading in humans. In addition to the death rates per capita in European countries (see, the case fatality rate is 2.24%. The number of deaths per million of the 183 countries analyzed is 1.626, showing the highest in Germany, Spain, and Italy, the lowest in Australia and in the U.S. Finally, the death rate varies within and between countries. As the number of cases increases, the number of deaths also does.

We demonstrate that, with the present method, the required accuracy is reached already for a 10 ps long simulation with 900 charge sites and a 45 \u00c5 simulation box.

It mainly assesses the health status or the damage of organs that can be evaluated by computerized image analysis. The task has been developed for a series of ultrasound images from patients with different levels of damage to their livers.  \n\nThe assessment of the liver damage is based on the comparison of healthy organs with the lesioned ones. The damage can be caused by a variety of pathological or physiological conditions such as: fatty liver or steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinomas, or even hemangioma.  \n\n[TUT_URL] \n[/TUT]\n\n\n16/97\n<NAME>\n\n# [TUT] Breast Cancer Analysis Using Cytological Images\nThe identification of biomarkers is extremely important in the early detection and prognosis of cancer. To this end, we propose in this article machine learning methods for breast cancer analysis using cytological images as biomarkers.  \n\nIn terms of cancer, cytological images are a promising tool for characterizing and assessing cancers and other types of diseases. They play a key role since they allow to visualize and study samples of living tissue biopsies, or to prepare images that have the form of histological maps. A histological map is a set of images of different magnifications, which represent a slide of pathological tissue. The magnification provides detailed information of the cells and helps in the determination of the type of tumor and its location.  \n\nFor this article, we have worked with publicly available images from the BreaKDown project. The BreaKDown project was carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in collaboration with the European Research Network (ERN) on Breast Cancer. The project's goal was to collect a large amount of data with cancer characteristics from publicly available repositories, as a basis for",

The products were characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and single-crystal XRD in cases of 4 and 6.

The structures of 4 and 6 resemble that of 3. It is interesting that the compounds differ in terms of their overall charge and hydrogen-bond motifs. In cases of 4 and 6, the structure of 4 is non-centrosymmetric due to the presence of imidazolate anions, whereas 6 has no symmetry due to the replacement of the Ba(2+) cation by a Ba(2+) cation with a large ionic radius in the anions and the occurrence of hydrogen bonding in the form of an unprecedented -BaN(4)H(2)O chain as well as hydrogen bonding in the form of weak associates , 2H(",

It is part of a series of systematic reviews of risk factors that affect cancer outcomes in men and women. All published and unpublished papers reporting on individual dietary factors and breast cancer were reviewed. Forty-eight reports published or in press in 26 different journals met the criteria for inclusion. Most of these were retrospective (n = 25) and only 19 used validated dietary assessment methods; half of these, however, were rated as being of poor quality. In the analysis, most studies (n = 39) were grouped into cohort or case-control designs. There were insufficient data to permit pooled analysis. There is mixed evidence regarding the role of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol in relation to risk of breast cancer after menopause. Many studies suggest consumption of soy and other isoflavones is protective, but the results have also been inconsistent. Several other dietary constituents have been studied including protein, energy, fibre and glycaemic load. Alcohol consumption may be of a protective effect. Many of these findings may be a consequence of methodological problems and, given the amount of heterogeneity across studies, data from individual studies should be interpreted with caution.

These networks include many hidden layers stacked on top of each other. \nIn these deep learning networks, the word features are first extracted with a convolution layer, followed by a deep max-pooling (sub-sampling) layer. Finally, the combined features extracted from all the hidden layers are passed to the classification layer for classification. \n\nTo obtain word level features, a sentence is represented as an array of word segments with word vectors.  The sentence is then fed through a convolution layer, which outputs a 1 x N vector with feature values for each hidden layer of the network.  Each word segment is considered a filter and is convolved with all words of the sentence, with the word vector as an activation function. \nThe result of the convolution operation is then passed through a deep max(pooling) layer which takes the maximum value for a word and adds the same word vector.  This operation reduces the spatial resolution of the feature maps as well as making the network more robust to over fitting, which is a common problem in deep CNN networks. \nIn order to classify the words, the feature vectors are fed into the classification layer.  The classification layer consists of neurons that have a sigmoid activation function. After training the neural network, we need to obtain the probabilities for each word in the sentence. Finally, we apply a softmax function to our output probabilities. This is equivalent to normalizing the output probabilities to sum to one. \nFor all words w, the probabilities p w are calculated as follows. Note that since n is the number of words in each sentence, so the p w are the probabilities that the ith word has the label y i . \n$$\\quad\n               p_i = (sigmoid(i,w)) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(y_i w)}}$$\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# TODO: Create a class to contain a CNN model\n\n# A CNN is a deep neural network with several convolutional layers.\n# Here we will represent a sentence as an array of vectors, one\n# for each word.

The group included 52 patients (36 males and 16 females, 59 +/- 3.5 years), in whom at the initial period of sporadic cerebral stroke the blood pressure increased up to 180/105 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was higher than 100 mm Hg. All patients received aspirin in a dose of 100 mg per day during the 90-day period of observation. Patients were followed-up in out-patient setting and underwent the following examinations: MRI, MRA (25 patients), EchoCG (25 patients), Holter's ECG (26 patients), Dopplerography (25 patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly one case of relapse of cerebrovascular stroke was registered in the group of patients with initial hyperemia of the brain who received aspirin.

The optimal duration of chemotherapy is not known. A total of 7,851 invasive ductal cancer patients were randomly selected from a pool of 296,309 patients in the National Cancer Database with diagnosis between 1998 and 2013. The association between the duration of chemotherapy and recurrence risk, breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality (ACM) was analyzed by multivariate Cox regression models and smooth curve fittings. The optimal duration of chemotherapy was examined by restricted cubic spline. The multivariate analysis revealed that recurrence risk was decreased by the duration of chemotherapy, and the dose of chemotherapy. Recurrence risk was increased by chemotherapy with hormonal modulators. Breast cancer mortality was decreased significantly. However, ACM was no significant. Dose \u2265 30 cycles was associated with a decrease in the recurrence risk, breast cancer mortality, all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression analysis, and increased recurrence interval compared with dose < 30 cycles. Duration less than 6 cycles was associated with high recurrence risk, increased hazard ratio of death, breast cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. The duration of chemotherapy was an independent predictor of recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Chemotherapy did not improve the outcomes in terms of all-cause mortality. The dose of chemotherapy was associated with improved prognosis.

The disassembling capability was confirmed by scanning and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and the results revealed that only the NP core elements (Ti and Zr) were deinserted into the channel, while the solvent elements (C and T) stayed within NPs. The deinserted elements were not detected after deassembling, indicating that the NPs were disassembled to a molecular level and the materials were disengaged from the NP structure.

Its implications on society include tremor-elicited hand impairment, degraded functional performance, and social stigmatization. Due to its high prevalence and devastating physical and cognitive effects on patients, tremor has been the subject of continuous research on understanding its neural mechanisms and developing non-invasive treatments. Despite its prevalence, tremor remains an overlooked motor disorder that is under-researched and under-treated by clinicians and healthcare systems worldwide. Current treatments for tremor include medications such as propranolol and diazepam as well as physical treatments such as botulinum toxin injections known as Botox. Although these treatments have achieved moderate success, many patients are left with tremors that cannot be alleviated by current treatments. In these cases, the tremors must remain, or have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including physical discomfort, psychological stress, and disability and degraded functional performance. To supplement or replace current therapeutic options, tremor suppression using biofeedback, electrical neuromodulation, medications, mechanical devices, and exercise is receiving greater interest as a means to address and alleviate tremor symptoms. Although much clinical research into tremor suppression has been completed, the overall trend of clinical trials indicates a lack of progress in the development of such treatments. In this paper, we survey the literature on tremor suppression to understand what is known and where gaps in the clinical research exist. We identify the many studies published on tremor suppression, including the different techniques and their clinical success, and analyze them against clinical progress in the field of tremor suppression. The current trends that are apparent from the survey reveal a dearth of high-quality clinical trials of tremor suppression, and thus a need for increased clinical investigation.\n\n# Introduction\nTremor is defined as \"abnormal rhythmical oscillatory movement of a body segment against gravity with increased amplitude during execution of a motor task\" [bib_ref]  The management of tremor",

It is demonstrated that this is mainly due to the formation of homo- and heteroassembly of the guest and host molecules of copper-bound/free calixarene ligands. The complex with Cu2+ in aqueous acetonitrile can be transferred into the Cu0 state in the presence of alkali acetates. Reversible transitions between the Cu0 and Cu2+ states, along with the homo- and heterooligomerization of such species, were visualized by various spectroscopic methods. This is a proof-of-principle that reversible disassembly/assembly of a macrocyclic complex can occur in a heterogeneous aqueous solution, which is an important task for technological applications toward heterogeneous catalytic systems.<EOD> Hormonally active and inactive metabolites of o,p'-DDT in breast milk and the effect of maternal liver enzymes.\nTwenty-eight breast milk samples were analysed for 4-OH-DDT (the main metabolite of o,p'-DDT), and also for its inactive metabolites p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD, with regard to possible association between the milk hormone levels and the activity of liver enzymes as well as maternal characteristics.

The first somatic genetic testing in Japan was implemented in 2003 for cystic fibrosis, and the number of institutions implementing somatic genetic testing has been increasing every year. Thus, it has become imperative to understand the various processes and challenges involved in testing, from pre-analysis to postanalysis. In this overview, we describe the somatic genetic testing process, examining issues associated with pre-testing, testing, and post-testing.\n\n# Introduction\nMost genetic tests now performed in Japan are somatic, and are typically performed in molecular pathology labs. Since the first report on somatic genetic testing of CF (1) in 2003, the number of facilities carrying out somatic genetic testing has been increasing each year; as of 2020, 472 genetic testing medical facilities have been approved to perform somatic genetic testing by the Ministries of Health, Labour and Welfare [bib_ref]  Trends in Somatic Genetic Testing for Rare Diseases: 2003-2020 Based on Information..., Muranaka [/bib_ref] . During this period, the number of approved genetic testing facilities increased at an average rate of approximately 50 each year; in recent years, many hospitals with advanced medical diagnostic facilities have begun to carry out somatic genetic testing.\nIn 2003, CF was the first disease to receive government-approved reimbursement for somatic genetic testing.

You type in a function name but the output of a function in R is usually the value of a variable in an object.

Try to type the value print( output(arg) ) to make sure the function works in the console like it should here:\n[1] \"ARG\"\n\nOne way to print the value like you are asking for is with do.call(), and you can pass a list containing any number of arguments as the second argument:\ndo.call(\"print\", list(output, arg))\n\nTry this in your R session: This is the first argument to the command, and the brackets are important for the second argument. The second argument is another argument. It contains the values you would normally place in an object's $ argument.\n\nIf you are not using base R but some other package, you can simply put the variable name in quotation marks to return that variable's value: base R\n\nDo.call, as you pointed out to yourself (your code), does not return the value of the function, but of the variables (and possibly argument names) within the function itself. For example:\ndo.call(\"f1\", c(1,2))  ## [1] 5\n\nf1 <- function(x){x+1}\n\nIf you pass in an argument as is, however (e.g. \"x\" instead of x), it returns the argument as is (and the parent function returns f1), resulting in the evaluation of the call.

If you cannot determine the eligibility at patient-level, you should go to the second step by Trial-level eligibility. Then, repeat the patient-level-based procedure. \n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale:\n0",

All rows in the trial-level eligibility matrix of the trial are not in a decreasing order from left to right, and all rows in the trial-level eligibility matrix of the clinical trial are in a decreasing order from left to right.\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with the matrices, please consider it as a 3x3 matrix of the trial-level eligibility for a patient, in which each row represents a random patient for the trial and each column represents a patient assessment factor. In total, there are three columns in the trial-level eligibility matrix of the trial. Each cell of the matrix shows the assessment results of the inclusion criteria of the patient for the trial. A cell of the matrix is empty, if the corresponding patient is not assessed for the inclusion criteria of the trial by the clinicians. \n        In the trial-level eligibility matrix of the trial, the first column represents patient age ,  the second column represents gender , and the third column represents the disease .\n       After determining whether the patients of the trial meet the requirements of the inclusion criteria and performing an individual assessment of the inclusion criteria, you should use these results to determine the trial-level eligibility of the trial. For instance, if a patient satisfies the age-related constraint of the first column , the patient is assessed as 1 in age category \"18-35 years\"; if a patient does not satisfy the age-related constraint of the first column , the patient is assessed as 0 in age category \"36-50 years\"; if a patient satisfies the age-related constraint of the first column , the patient is assessed as 0 in age category \"51-80 years\". The same is true for the gender-related constraints of the second of the columns and the disease-related constraints of the third of the columns. Note that the trial-level eligibility matrix of the trial is in a decreasing order from left to right.\n\n[INST] Let's implement the procedure using R and Bioconductor.

A tinnitus diary was kept on a daily basis, and at the first visit and every 6 months patients were assessed for anxiety, depression and hearing loss. Tinnitus questionnaires were completed on self assessment of annoyance and sleep disturbance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-two patients did not reattend for the assessments, and a total of 86 had completed data sets available for analysis. Amitriptyline was found to have a significantly beneficial response in 34 of 46 patients (73.91%), and tinnitus distress was reduced in 67 of 79 patients (84.81% 95% CI ) in the group fitted with hearing aids. Depression was an independent predictor of positive responses in the amitriptyline group, with a history of a hearing threshold greater than 10 dB in the better hearing ear predicting favourable outcomes for hearing aids.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmitriptyline could be useful in selected patients and hearing aids as effective as amitriptyline.

(2) It is important to know the residents' daily lives and mental health; therefore, medical doctors, care managers, and public health nurses should visit those who live alone. (3) It was possible to receive and understand the message from local government officers as to how residents could continue living independently for longer through this workshop. (4) It is necessary to conduct joint meetings with local government officers more regularly to increase the level of collaboration. (5) Since medical professionals had not been able to visit residents' homes as much as before the pandemic, it was necessary to continue such visits after the pandemic. (6) Since the time for home visits was short, it was sometimes difficult to have time for them. (7) It is easy to get a message from local government officers, and they had confidence in the community care workers; therefore, they had no problems.

C-peptide has been recognised to predict GP in adult patients with T2DM, however, the C-peptide to insulin ratio (CPR) as a possible biomarker to predict GP in adult T2DM patients is still unknown. Methods: 150 adult patients with T2DM (58 males [38%] and 92 females [62%]) were included in this cross-sectional study. T2DM patients with CP-IR >2.5, n = 79, were categorised as GP (CP-IR group). The patients were assigned to the T2DM comparison and T2DM (CP IGR) group according to diagnostic criteria for GP patients with CP-IR \u22642.5. Diagnosis of GP in patients with T2DM was performed by validated tools (i.e. gastric emptying and abdominal pain symptoms score). CPR was calculated as a ratio of serum C-peptide to insulin levels. CPR, body mass index, blood pressure and glucose homeostasis were measured at baseline and after 2 years. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, x 2 test, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation tests. Results: CP-IR patients showed longer duration of diabetes, had higher body mass index (BMI) with greater waist-hip ratio (WHR) together with higher prevalence of diabetic complications than patients in the comparison group. A total of 51 patients fulfilled the gastric emptying criteria in the T2DM CP IGR group.

This is a dynamic tissue that is constantly exposed to the environment, where skin integrity is dependent upon a precise and orchestrated balance of proliferation and differentiation, with minimal inter- and intradermal invasion. Skin disease such as psoriasis is caused by this imbalance due to alterations in keratinocyte fate. Therefore, the study of the skin is of particular interest with respect to understanding basic cell biology and cell-cell junctional signaling. This review focuses on epigenetic regulation of human basal epidermal morphogenesis, and will discuss the roles of epidermal cell-cell junctions in epigenetic gene regulation in normal and psoriatic skin.<EOD> .\nThis paper reports an experimental surgical technique to prevent anastomotic stenosis. It involves the use of the pedicled jejunal flap which is raised via a retrocolic approach. The technique was applied in 11 cases, including 3 patients who had previously undergone Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy. These patients had recurrent stricture due to stenosis in the common enteric anastomosis. The jejunal flap was applied to the upper portion of the anastomosis, which was also reinforced with the anterior wall of this pedicled flap. Postoperative periods ranged from 3 months to 17 months. All cases had follow up and the results was very good: no anastomotic stenosis was observed, and good oral intake was achieved.

Despite the advances in surgical and medical therapy and the introduction of newer antibiotics, as well as diagnostic studies, the incidence and mortality of IE has not been reduced as much as anticipated. The appropriate use of antibiotics (especially for the empiric treatment of IE due to its poor prognosis), along with a better understanding of the role of antimicrobials, would be of great help both to improve clinical outcomes and to minimize the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and increase microbial resistance, a major worldwide threat. Areas covered The article is a systematic review of the current literature on issues regarding the use of antibiotics in IE. Expert opinion A better knowledge of antibiotics, especially their pharmacokinetics, and a wider availability of susceptibility testing will allow a better choice of broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with other antibiotics, according to the risk factors, infectious germ, location of the infection, and the infective focus (IE-associated or native/prosthetic endocarditis), or according to the empiric treatment required for IE.<EOD> .\nThe effect of propranolol and propranolol + glucose given to experimental animals on",

Our technique involved using aqueous lidocaine and epinephrine in the tumescent solution (TS). This was carried out because lidocaine is easily prepared in a pharmacy as a 20 percent solution without additional solutes. A TS containing only 1 percent lidocaine and 0.04 percent epinephrine was tested using a single-blinded randomized crossover technique on 8 consecutive patients who received this solution and one of four other TSs. One patient in each group experienced bruising. No edema was noted, and pain was minimal. This technique was well tolerated by all patients.

Our hypothesis is that if we look only at cancers we feel reasonably confident will respond to therapy, we may still see a 20-200 fold difference in response rates. \nOne limitation of our hypothesis is that we can expect relatively few cancers (and hence few patients treated for them) to respond to a given drug, with a drug response defined by the shrinking of the tumor size for each patient tested. The fact that patients may die before a complete response is observed with some drugs also poses a problem. In order to have a successful competition, it will be necessary for us",

        "output": "# Conclusion\nIn this tutorial we have introduced the concept of clinical trials using a simple example. We used the inclusion and exclusion criteria to compare a patient note and a clinical trial and evaluated its suitability based on a set of rules. In a real-life setting, the use of inclusion and exclusion criteria is standard practise in a clinical trial. In the biomedical domain, many tools have been developed for eligibility assessment, e.g. KDMR [bib_ref]  A knowledge driven method for patient eligibility assessment, Effort [/bib_ref]  , MedXN [bib_ref]  MedXN: An ontology-based, cross-platform medical applications search engine -design and evaluation, Noy [/bib_ref]  , MedTN [bib_ref]  MedTN: A novel approach for eligibility assessment in clinical trials, Zhang [/bib_ref]  , MedLEE [bib_ref]  MedLEE: A high-performance medication information extraction system for clinical narratives, Xu [/bib_ref]  , Med-EX [bib_ref]  EX: Fast Automatic Recognition of Medical Event Expressions, Munkhdalai [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  EX: EXtracting Medicine, Munkhdalai [/bib_ref]  or MSE [bib_ref]  Toward automatic patient inclusion eligibility for prospective trials: An ontology-based tool, N\u00fa\u00f1ez [/bib_ref] . In this tutorial, we have explored this approach on a patient note and have shown the concept and results. To summarize, it was simple yet challenging and the clinical trials are not standardized and difficult to assess. We have not used any tool to conduct this assessment but the use of tools could ease the process, reduce the overall time for assessment and enable researchers and clinicians to identify clinical trials they may be suitable for [bib_ref]  Eliciting patients' eligibility in prospective trials from primary care electronic records, Zeng [/bib_ref] .\n\n# Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank my colleagues from the Centre for e-Research who reviewed, critiqued, tested and found errors in the paper.

The patient was admitted to the emergency department because of dyspnea, pain in the area of the scapula, and weakness of all limbs over the last six days, which were accompanied by increasing dys- oral, dysphagia, diarrhea, and weight loss (90\u2005kg to 79 kg).\n\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\nApart from HF, the initial laboratory tests showed a normal leucocyte count and normal kidney function/electrolytes. The patient's brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was slightly elevated (110\u2009ng/l) at 398\u2009ng/l. His thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH) was increased (26.12\u2005\u00b5U/ml), his free T3 levels were decreased (0.55\u2005pmol/l), and his free T4 was normal (0.92\u2005pmol/l).\n\n\nTREATMENT AND COURSE\nApart from the application of dopamine, i.v., the patient was treated with antibiotics for infectious pneumonia and a proton-pump inhibitor for gastroesophageal reflux. His free T3 levels increased from 0.55\u2005pmol/l on admission to 2.1\u2005pmol/l in the following few days and the TSH decreased to a normal value. However, the patient died two days after his admission from hypovolemic shock caused by the worsening of heart failure during the further hospital course. His final BNP and NT-proBNP were 1121\u2009ng/l and 14,377\u2005ng/l.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPneumonia, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances are the most common causes of T3 and T4 disorders in HF.

He has a previous history of severe asthma. One year ago, his pulmonologist diagnosed him with an early stage of COPD (GOLD II) and he had been evaluated in a pulmonology clinic weekly. His therapy consists of a combination of tiotropium bromide and salmeterol xinafoate and a dose of 300 mg/d beclomethasone and has been evaluated monthly for lung function testing. Lastly, his previous diagnosis of severe asthma at the age of 20 seems to be stabilized. His smoking status is not recent, just as his last visit to a pulmonologist was one year ago. His smoker's cough is severe. Currently, his vital signs are quite normal, with the exception of mild tachypnea and chronic hypoxemia. On admission to the emergency services, he complained of dyspnea, sputum production, and chest pain on effort. His chest x-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation. He is unable to perform spirometry because of his severe cough, but he was examined by a cardiothoracic surgeon who measured his COPD severity during a VC test (lung volume measurement) and he obtained 65% of the theoretical maximum predicted forced expiratory volume",

STA is a secure research space for University of Toronto faculty, students and staff. All who have completed the training program are admitted. STA provides computing environment with access to a wide range of statistical software under central administrator control. STA contains three databases. Two of these databases, called HSDC and UTREB, store data from research projects funded by ICES and the research ethics board (REB) respectively. The third database is a clinical trial support database that contains information on clinical trials and health system data sources on which to identify potentially eligible patients. We require this information before recruitment of trial volunteers begins.\n\n### Data access (provided by the data custodian)\nResearchers seeking to use this dataset as part of a health research project must first complete the STA training program. Once trained, they can access the database via STA's client via their own University of Toronto credentials. After submitting a data access request, the researcher will need to be trained on how to access and extract data from STA. The researcher can then request the specific data needed from the data custodian. Only University of Toronto faculty, staff, and students can access STA, and only when they have completed the relevant training and have had their project approved by the STA's research ethics board.\n\n### Supporting documentation/policy (provided by the data custodian)\n<EOD> The role of methyl eugenol as a main constituent of the essential oil from A. nilotica in alleviating colchicine\u2010induced oxidative stress and liver injury in wistar albino rats\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of methyl eugenol against colchicine\u2010induced hepatic injury.

Both the treatment group (N\u2009=\u200939) and the waiting list control group (N\u2009=\u200938) show improvements of symptom distress and quality of life.

Antenatal history and social characteristics of 1062 women was analysed together with data on 820 of these women obtained at the time of an interview 6 weeks postnatally. Results showed a frequency of postpartum depressed mood of 12\u00b72% on the EPDS and a higher rate of depressed mood among single women, those with an antenatal history of depressed mood and those with current emotional/relationship problems. Social and environmental factors did not correlate reliably with postpartum depressed mood. A further study examined the sensitivity and specificity of the EPDS using a standard clinical diagnostic interview as the standard of reference. This showed an estimated optimal EPDS cut-off at 12/13 to define the presence of high risk depressed mood (sensitivity 0\u00b775 & specificity 0\u00b780) using this gold standard.<EOD> Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis \u2013 from Pathophysiology to Care\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in adult",

The widespread presence of mutations that interact with the environment to influence fitness provides a mechanism for environmental factors to influence evolutionary outcomes. Furthermore, mating behaviors, which can be influenced by environments, are important factors in evolutionary outcomes as they can influence adaptation to different environments. Previous studies show that the worm Caenorhabditis elegans undergoes rapid and repeated genome-wide changes in mating preference with age. However, the extent to which these changes are due to genetic variation or influenced by the environment is not known. We examined whether genetic variation influences mating preferences with age. We used a C. elegans strain with more extensive genomewide variation (CA14206) as compared to the Bristol N2 wild type strain and a related strain carrying a non-lethal mutation in the insulin/IGF-1 gene (daf-2) to examine the influence of genetic background on changes in mating preference with age. We found that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway genes influence these changes, but that the extent to which each gene influences mating preferences with age is dependent on genetic background. The N2 wild-type strain showed the greatest decline in female mating efficiency with age, and in this strain, daf-2 delayed this decline. However, in the CA14206 strain, the insulin/IGF-1 pathway genes had little influence on changes in mating preference with age. Daf-2 also delayed a decline in female mating efficiency with age in strain CA14206, but only partially inhibited this decline. In summary, genetic variation influences the extent to which mating preferences change with age, as well as the extent to which insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes affect these changes.\n\n# Introduction",

Despite its recognized importance, its pathogenesis remains elusive and incompletely understood. Over the past decade, significant improvements in the identification of genetic contributors to complex diseases have been achieved. Genome-wide association study methodology was used to analyze more than three million single nucleotide polymorphisms in a large panel of individuals. Among them, the first studies reported by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium demonstrated the success of this strategy to identify the first reproducible associations between variants in the complement factor H (CFH) gene and age-related macular degeneration, whereas a subsequent meta-analysis of genome-wide association data reported by the National Health and Examination Survey identified the strongest genetic determinants of blood pressure to date. Using these methodologies, we recently sought to identify novel genetic determinants of the clinical presentation of preeclampsia, as the clinical features of this condition have some similarities to age-related macular degeneration and blood pressure. Our analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data in 200 preeclamptic patients and 200 control subjects identified two loci independently associated with preeclampsia; one in the complement factor H gene and one in the CFH-like 1 gene (CFHL1). This finding, coupled with data from the literature showing that preeclampsia is characterized by complement activation and increased proteinuria, is consistent with preeclampsia resembling a complement-mediated immunological response syndrome of gestation. Furthermore, the loci identified are located within introns and contain functional single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter splicing efficiency, leading to altered gene function and protein expression.<EOD> Exploring the Link Between Nucleic Acid Drug Administration and Cachexia in Cancer Patients: A Scoping Review\n\nCachexia is a multifactorial metabolic disease defined by weight loss and metabolic abnormalities.

Ketamine has many effects on GABA A receptors and could be used to reduce propofol. The purpose of this paper was to study if pretreatment with ketamine reduces the amount of propofol delivered intravenously while maintaining anesthesia for patients receiving sevoflurane/ remifentanil anesthesia for hysterectomy.Material/Methods:Forty patients were divided into 2 groups by applying a propensity score matching method (1:1), including those who received a propofol infusion based on target-controlled infusion (TCI) method for anesthesia and those who received a ketamine infusion to achieve anesthesia. The baseline parameters were balanced between the 2 groups. The concentration of sevoflurane and remifentanil were maintained via target-controlled infusion, while the concentration of propofol was adjusted by the TCI method. Hemodynamic data were recorded after the induction of anesthesia and 5, 10, 15, and 30 min into surgery. In addition, the recovery time of consciousness was compared.Results:The minimum concentration of propofol needed to maintain the target level of consciousness was greater in the low ketamine group than in the normal ketamine group during the first 30 min of maintaining the anesthesia. The average propofol dose during the first 10 min of surgery was greater in the low ketamine group as compared to the normal one.Conclusions:Pretreatment with a low dose of ketamine prolonged the induction of general anesthesia, induced greater propofol requirement and higher blood pressure during the first 30 min of anesthesia, and delayed the recovery of consciousness.

[bib_ref]  Prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination, Austrian [/bib_ref]  More than 100 viruses are known to cause respiratory tract infections in humans and are typically clustered into five groups based on their mode of transmission and cellular targets: orthopneumoviridae, coronaviridae, paramyxoviridae, filoviridae, and rhabodoviridae.

The most common viruses that cause mild cold-like symptoms in humans in the absence of comorbid chronic medical conditions are, in order of significance: picornavirus (Rhinovirus), coronavirus (HCoVs-229, OC43, NL63, HCoV-HKU1), human parainfluenza virus 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal human metapneumovirus (HMPV-A and HMPV-B), adenovirus (AdV-A to AdV-F), influenza virus (IV), human bocavirus, and, to a lesser extent, the human coronaviruses (HCoVs)229, HCoV-O, HCoV-NB, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63; 3\u22127 however, the symptoms of these viruses overlap dramatically with each other and many times with typical bacterial-caused infections, 6\u221210 making definitive diagnosis a major clinical challenge.

The molecular mechanism by which obesity increases colonic tumor incidence remains elusive. In tumor-prone ApcMin/+ mice, the dietary fat increases tumor growth, and the intestinal microbiota appears to contribute to the oncogenic effect of diet. To determine if the intestinal microbiota and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling contribute to the tumor-promoting effect of dietary fat in ApcMin/+ model, we characterized the composition of intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria, examined TLR expression, and evaluated intestinal tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) compared with a high-fat diet supplemented with antibiotics (HFD-Abx). The HFD, but not HFD-Abx, induces the expression of TLR-9 and TLR-4, in the intestinal mucosa of ApcMin/+ mice. Notably, the growth of intestinal tumors in ApcMin/+ mice fed the HFD was significantly increased compared with mice fed the HFD-supplemented with-Abx. Together, data suggest that obesity-enhanced tumor growth through the TLR pathway in the ApcMin/+ model.<EOD> Exposure of mice to the 1960s Lake Champlain plastic layer resulted in changes in the murine gut microbiome and induction of inflammation\n\nPlastic pollutants have been shown to induce immunotoxicity.

We focused on how the community composition, diversity, and relative abundance of endohelminth parasites of two distinct populations of salmonid fishes (Chinook salmon: O. tshawytscha and rainbow trout: O. mykiss) changes across the life cycle during migration from a spawning area and across the salinity range of inland freshwater environments. We collected 478 Chinook salmon and 523 rainbow trout fishes; 181 (38% total) of the Chinook salmon fishes and 203 (38% total) of the rainbow trout fishes collected contained one or more endohelminth parasites. Both Chinook salmon and rainbow trout parasite communities were more diverse in the spawning areas and became less diverse as fish moved downstream. As fish moved downstream, parasite communities of Chinook salmon and rainbow trout became increasingly similar, suggesting that, in moving downstream, parasites from similar niches become more prevalent. By the confluence of the Klickitat River, parasite communities of Chinook salmon are the most similar to those of rainbow trout collected from the confluence of the Hood River. In this analysis, we included parasite species that were rare to eliminate bias toward common species. Species dominance did not vary substantially with downstream location and parasite species that dominated the spawning areas are less likely to be common as fish move downstream. For both the Chinook salmon and rainbow trout, parasites shared between species become less prevalent as the downstream distance between fish increases. Finally, there is a marked increase in the relative importance of ectoparasites, the most abundant group of endohelminth parasites in riverine environments, in downstream locations for both fish species.\n\n# Introduction",

The final sample consisted of 1,600 adults between the ages of 16 and 63 (M = 34.66, standard deviation (SD) = 12.55) with a broad spectrum of psychotic/personality disorders. Associations of impulsivity and sensation-seeking with both the severity of psychosis and with the severity of psychopathology/personality traits, and the correlation of impulsivity with sensation-seeking, were all significant. Of the impulsivity domains, negative urgency and positive urgency had significant independent associations with the severity of psychopathology/personality traits, beyond sensation-seeking and negative urgency. Neither urgency nor sensation-seeking domains (positive urgency, negative urgency, lack of perseverance, sensation-seeking) were associated with outcome (psychotic-like experiences, psychotic-like symptoms, psychotic-like experiences with distress, distress and psychotic-like symptoms). Impulsivity and sensation-seeking are related variables, each of which are associated with different traits. Impulsive and sensation-seeking traits are not, however, reliable predictors of future psychosis-outcome.\n\n# Introduction\nSensation-seeking and impulsivity are related constructs, conceptually and operationally [bib_ref]  The relationship of impulsiveness, sensation-seeking, and drinking refusal self-efficacy to drinking",

Traditional cellular studies use cultures, such as two-dimensional (2D) monolayer or three-dimensional (3D) cultures, to provide information on the cellular signaling pathways. However, these cultures fail to provide complex cellular architectural and functional information because the cells are usually dispersed in the medium or suspended in the gel, such as cultures in Matrigel\u00ae. These traditional cultures provide only a limited understanding of complex cellular systems because the cells are isolated from each other and are not organized as a functional structure. In addition, the traditional systems often rely on a single cell to form the aggregate that leads to significant variability in results that would arise from the inherent properties of each cell. Therefore, a system is needed that can provide the cell with the necessary support structure for mimicking an artificial tissue and at the same time maintain the 3D architecture for long-term studies. This manuscript explores a new experimental system of utilizing hanging-drop culture to form 3D multicellular aggregates, termed a synembryon. This technology enables cellular coculture and can control the morphogenesis and viability of the cellular aggregates over multiple days with ease of observation within a microscope. Our work explores several variations of the system, such as hanging-drop microtissues with different cell ratios and cell densities, and their long-term coculture viability. As proof of principle, our system was also used successfully to study the formation of lung microtissues as a scaffold and cellular support for growing 3D human lung tissue in culture. This method provides a novel platform to study 3D cellular interactions, tissue formation, and morphogenesis in a simple and high-throughput fashion.<EOD> Dry Eye Disease in Women: Risk Factors and Disease Characteristics\n\nPrevalence of dry eye disease (DED) varies based on age, gender, and ethnicity.

The PAX3 gene harbors six exons. Mutation analysis revealed a novel p.Ser152Leu mutation in exon 1. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing, by a direct sequencing analysis of the amplified products from proband\u2019s blood sample (Figure 1). PAX3 mutations have been previously reported associated with type 1WD. In a family reported by Chen et al., a mutation (c.464T>C) in exon 1 was identified, resulting in truncation of the PAX3 protein at codon 155 and consequently in the loss of the PD in the protein encoded by PAX3 gene. In another family with WS, reported by Tsai et al., the authors identified an in frame deletion of five amino acids (Arg-ArgPheGlyGlu) in the PAX3 protein (p.Arg65_Phe69del) resulting in the loss of the ETS DNA-binding domain. They concluded that the PAX3 mutation caused loss-of-function mutation in ETS domain and led to abnormal interactions with other transcription regulator proteins and hence produced abnormal gene products. In 2013, Wang et al. demonstrated through in vitro expression assays that WS mutant PAX3 proteins interacted with and repressed the transactivation activity of wild-type PAX3 and MYOCD proteins, implying that mutant PAX3 proteins were dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type PAX3 and MYOCD functions. The PAX3 protein has five domains from the amino to carboxyl terminal: paired domain, transcription activation domain (AD1, AD2) and repression domain (PD, CRD) (Figure 1). They found the pathogenic mutation was located in the AD1 domain and the mutated PAX3 protein was more stable and easily accumulated in the cell cytoplasm.

Hence, an exploration of the molecular mechanism of this disease progression will be beneficial to the survival and treatment outcome of such patients. In this study, integrated bioinformatics analysis was applied to the selection of prognostic molecules associated with the progression of OSCC. First, gene expression data of OSCC patients were collected and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on three expression profiles for gene expression profiling of the OSCC process. Subsequently, a microRNA (miRNA)-targets network was built based on the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and DEGs. Thereafter, key modules in the network were identified by the WGCNA. Four hub genes and 56 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs in the blue and yellow modules that are most closely related to the OSCC progression were retained by the analysis of the KEGG pathway, GO annotation, and literatures about the genes. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated that CAV1 is an important molecule among the genes that influence the malignant degree of OSCC. This study will provide a new perspective and basis for the molecular mechanism of the OSCC process.<EOD> A Novel Protective Role of Sphingosine Kinase 1 in Isoniazid-Induced Hepatotoxicity\n\nCitation: Hossain, M.M.; Kim, Y.M.; Dutta, S.; Chang, J.; Hanusova, E.; Deng, J.Y.; Abernethy, D.R.\n\n# Introduction\nSphingolipids are bioactive lipids involved in a myriad of processes including proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and differentiation and have been implicated in the regulation of cancer, cardiovasc",

It has been suggested that ovarian angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, is needed for follicular growth and ovulation. VEGF stimulates endothelial cell function for angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown human stem cell paracrine effects when cells are co-injected with cells or in response to the co-injection of human bone marrow mononuclear cells with VEGF. The aim of this study is to investigate the paracrine effects of VEGFmicroinjected human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) on mice with premature ovarian failure (POF). In this study, intraoperative live cell imaging was performed using hAMSCs microinjected with Cell Tracker\u2122 CM-Dil to check for the location of the cells. hAMSCs microinjected with VEGF expressed high levels of VEGF which stimulated angiogenesis in the ovarian tissue by increasing capillary blood vessel number in the preantral follicles using a follicle-produced o",

While most patients fail to spontaneously clear the virus after infection, some patients can clear the virus within a 6-month period. We have shown that the detection of subgenomic HCV RNA in the blood circulation of hemodialysis patients is correlated to the persistence of chronic infection. Since only RNA molecules produced from viral genomes present in the liver can potentially be secreted in the bloodstream (i.e., genomes of different genotypes, subtypes, and quasispecies), we have examined the intrahost diversity of HCV populations. This study aimed to compare the diversity of viral populations in the liver of chronically infected hemodialysis patients with the heterogeneity found in patients of the same hemodialysis centers but chronically infected and spontaneously cleared infections. A total of 54 hemodialysis patients were selected, including three patients with spontaneously cleared infections and 51 patients chronically infected with a subgenomic HCV RNA concentration of >10 copies/ml. The viral populations in the liver of the patients with cleared infections were more than twice as heterogeneous as those found in the chronic patients. Genotypic distribution and quasispecies compositions observed in plasma differed significantly between patients who cleared infections and those with chronic infection. The viral population present in viremic patients showed an intrahost diversity similar to that",

After tooth preparation, the cavity floor was finished with diamond fissure bur and the exposed dentin was etched for 15 seconds. Three different bonding agents: Single bond, Syntac, and Enforce were used for placing composite resin. Cylinders were then made with composites in a mold and subjected to thermocycling. The buccal and lingual sections of each tooth were prepared with buccolingual cross-sections. Then the teeth were placed in 37\u00b0C distilled water and were sectioned under light microscope after 24 hours. Microleakage was scored and microscopically evaluated. Results: Bucco-lingual and mesio-distal section showed that all three groups were leakage free at the proximal margins. However, there was significant difference in microleakage of teeth restored with Adper and Single bond (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in microleakage of teeth restored with Adper and Syntac and also teeth restored with Syntac and Enforce. Conclusion: All bonding agents resulted in leakage-free margin and Adper was least leakage and best adaptation than the other two bonding agents.\n\n# Introduction\nL ow fidelity of dentin bonding agents has remained a problem because the bonded interface is prone to hydrolytic and mechanical degradation.

According to the consensus document, no treatment for prostatitis has any \"established\" efficacy. Although \u03b1-blockers, antibiotics, phytotherapy agents such as sildenafil, etc. have been extensively tested in clinical trials, it is not clear whether these drugs really have therapeutic effect on CP. Recently, more and more reports were found to prove that acupuncture therapy is effective in relieving prostatitis symptoms. However, the specific mechanism of acupuncture therapy still is unclear, the specific treatment regimen has not been unified. It is difficult to summarize the efficacy of acupuncture therapy simply by analyzing these articles. Therefore, this article will give a brief review on CP and research progress of acupuncture on CP in recent years. And, this article will also discuss the potential mechanism and the unified program of acupuncture on CP. This article provides a comprehensive review of acupuncture on CP for clinical therapists who are involved in CP treatment in order to make a balanced judgment on the efficacy of acupuncture in CP patients and to make a wise choice of acupuncture program for the clinical practice.\n\n# Introduction\nChronic prostatitis (CP) is a common disease in urology clinics, with the incidence of 2.5-10%, and in the group between 18 and 50 years old [bib_ref]  Prevalence and burden of prostatitis in Finnish population, Salminen [/bib_ref] .

It will take 60 minutes for this case. \n\nPat. 1 was a 42-year-old female with a history of Type 1 diabetes and arterial hypertension. She noticed progressive weakness in her lower extremities and dyspnea. As a result, the patient was admitted to the hospital a few days later, where his complete blood count revealed a WBC count of 6.4 k/ L, an Hgb of 6.5 g/dL and platelet count of~238 k/ L. His CBC was normal for the three months prior to presenting. A few days later, the patient was discharged, and an outpatient appointment was made. She later missed her appointment, with no further contact.\n\nPat. 2 was a 25-year-old female with a history of migraines that she had been treated for with antibiotic agents.

Because of the high level of immunodepression in diabetic patients, it is supposed that patients with diabetes have a relatively higher risk of contracting tetanus infection. However, the results are not conclusive and there are inconsistencies among these studies. Therefore, a pooled analysis from all relevant studies was carried out to examine whether or not diabetes mellitus is a predisposing factor for tetanus infection among humans. Methods: Two reviewers independently selected all case-control or cohort studies assessing tetanus risk in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to healthy subjects. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (OR). I-square and a p-value were used to detect significant heterogeneity. Subgroup, meta-regression analyses and sensitivity analysis were performed in order to find explanations for the heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to estimate publication bias.

They may nonetheless have more incidence than generally recognized and lead to long periods of disability. There is little information about their evolution and management. The objective of the study was to collect dentists' occupational diseases data which appeared as diagnosis in their medical file. We conducted a retrospective study of the disease evolutions and the redeployment of dentists on the French labour market. In a 12-months study period, medical files of 1,074 dentists were retrospectively studied. A total of 45 dentists (4.2% ) were sick-listed and diagnosed as an occupational disease. Twelve were sick-listed by an occupational disease leading to permanent disability. Of the 45 sick-listed dentists 25 were redeployed by the National Insurance System. Of the 24 dentists remaining on the labour market and still sick-listed, 18 were on sick leave. Fifty-three percent were women. Forty-five percent of the dentists had no experience on the labour market, 14.3% had more than 10 years of experience. The median of the time needed to be on sick leave was 24 months. The most diseases were \"Diseases and disorders of the musculoskeletal system\", \"Others\", \"Diseases and disorders of the circulatory system\". Dental occupational disease is little or not recognized by society. It could be avoided with adequate ergonomic and preventive occupational training.<EOD> The role of Hsp70 chaperones in the maintenance of protein homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum\n\nAbbreviations 4HNE, 4-Hydroxynonenal; CAT, catalase; FADH2, reduced flavin adenine dinucleptide; Keap, Kelch EF-hand domain containing protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDM2, mouse double minute 2 homologue; MDRI, mouse double minute 2 resistant protein; PCCP, peroxiredoxin; SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1; TCA cycle, tr",

Methods: A total of 86 eyes of 86 patients who underwent pterygium surgeries for recurrences and/or persistent pterygium were enrolled. Patients were examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Recurrences were observed and evaluated by the masked surgeon. Results: The mean follow-up period was 24.8 \u00b1 19.0 months (range, 12 to 60 months). Postoperative corneal abrasions occurred in 9.4% of the patients. A recurrent pterygium occurred in 13 (15.8%) patients, and the mean recurrence-free period was 8.4 \u00b1 10.9 months (range, 1 to 48 months). The recurrent pterygium was treated by a simple pterygium excision in ten patients (22.7%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that a pterygium excision using the bull-eye technique is safe and results in a higher postoperative recurrence-free period compared to simple pterygium excision. Based on our results, we suggest that the bull-eye technique is a good surgical choice for treatment of recurrent or persistent pterygium.\n\n# Introduction\nPterygium is a disorder found at the junction of the bulbar conjunctiva and corneal limbus with an inflammatory tissue process, which is characterized by neovascularization and fibrosis. Pterygium is a prevalent disorder, found in 2.1-30.6% of the global populace, and it is common throughout all ages, ethnicities, and geological areas [bib_ref]  Epidemiology and risk factors",

Native DPP I occurs as a homodimer or, like the enzymes of DPP IV family, as a non-covalently linked heterotetramer. DPP I is one of five mammalian serine peptidases that can split dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. It is secreted from the kidney into the circulation and acts as a regulator of many biological processes. It influences, among others, renal proximal tubular function, platelet aggregation, insulin biosynthesisand blood pressure.\nDPP I is a glycoprotein containing 24 potential N-glycosylation sites; only eight of them have been reported to be occupied. The enzyme contains a single N-glycan on the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The N-glycan chain is a heterogeneous mixture, a complex type chitosaccharide. It has the following composition: Man 8 (GlcNAc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 )-GlcNAc(Gal 1 GalNAc) (DPP1-G1) or Gal (GlcNAc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 )-GalNA (GlcNAc(Man 3 Gal 1 GlcNAc 2 )) (DPP1-G2). The glycoprotein is expressed by human, rabbit, horse and many other mammals. The enzyme isolated from pigs' kidneys has been found to be the major formand is the model enzyme used in the studies of enzymatic activity.\nDeglycanation of glycoproteins by microbial enzymes was shown to be a promising tool in therapeutics and di",

On a surgical side, there is a trend in postgraduate training programs to have trainees perform the procedure more before a trainer takes over. Trainees still have to undergo a certification process, even though they may have passed hundreds of colonoscopies or flexible sigmoidoscopies, under the supervision of a trainer, before they can claim that they have become competent.\nIn terms of basic training, there are numerous teaching techniques available, such as the use of videos, lectures or didactic sessions. In terms of surgical training in which a procedure is performed on a model or phantom, there are also several options available. From the oldest to the more recent, we can describe a progression: from plastic models to dummies, from models with silicone-based simulators to virtual or realistic simulations (endoscopic simulators) [bib_ref]  The future of simulation in surgery, Ke [/bib_ref] .\nIn addition, in the field of endoscopy, the learning process is complicated by the fact that it is not sufficient or even necessary to be extremely good at endoscopic skill, as only the perforation of the organ is detr",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of real-time PCR when applied for detection and quantification of Escherichia coli in the urine samples obtained from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI). To that end, we used 16 real-time PCRs assays in conventional and quantitative modes, as well as a novel single tube technique called rapid real-time (rrt). The E. coli assays were evaluated with a spiked synthetic control in order to validate the results of these three methods and to validate the standard curve used in rrt. Three types of samples were evaluated: urine samples with 105 CFU mL\u22121 of E. coli as a pure culture, urine samples spiked with 1 \u00d7 102 CFU mL\u22121, and clinical urine samples with >105 CFU mL\u22121 of E. coli. The results obtained were directly comparable between the real time-PCR assays tested, and the results of these three techniques were similar. The rrt assay was 5-fold more sensitive than the other techniques. When used with synthetic controls, all three methods had similar results within a range of 0.1\u201310 CFU per assay, even down to 0.1 CFU per assay. The new simple, inexpensive, and rapid assay, the rrt, can be used to quantify bacteria in urine samples with high accuracy. This method will be an alternative to the classical technique for isolating urinary bacteria and a powerful additive for the UTI diagnostics panel.<EOD> Hair dye ingestion with the use of lighter and lighter fluid.\nA young 17-year old black male school pupil committed suicide by ingestion of a compound used to paint the hair of young women.

Although LCH is often diagnosed in early childhood, some patients are diagnosed in adulthood. Moreover, there have been uncommon cases in the literature which the patients presented with cranial LCH in adulthood. The demographics, clinical characteristics, and response to treatment in such patients are unclear. We analyzed adult patients with cranial LCH who were treated from 2008 to 2016 and classified them into early-onset group (within 45 years of age) and late-onset group (over 45 years of age). There were 15 earlyonset patients (eight males and seven females, median age 34 (21-45) years) and 13 late-onset patients (seven males, six females, median age 65 (53-68) years). In the early-onset group, five patients were symptomatic and 10 were asymptomatic. In late-onset group, six patients were symptomatic and seven were asymptomatic. All early-onset patients underwent treatment, and the symptoms were resolved in all of them after treatment. In late-onset group, one symptomatic patient was treated, and the remaining 12 symptomatic patients did not receive treatment. The cerebral lesions in late-onset patients mainly involved the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and corona radiata. All of them had residual lesions after the treatment. Thus, our findings provide essential information to clinicians to understand adult cranial LCH,",

        "output": "<EOD> Identification of mammalian GTPases, which interact with the cell cycle control protein p125, using two-hybrid screening.\np125(gag-mil) is a p53 homologue involved in cell cycle control of normal cells. Because some viral oncoproteins bind to p125 and inhibit its function, we identified the cellular proteins able to bind to its coiled-coil (CC) domain using two-hybrid technology. Three proteins were found to bind to the CC domain in intracellular locations distinct from the nucleus. Among these proteins, one was identified as Gbeta, a component of heterotrimeric transducin. In addition, 188 genes were isolated from an intracellular two-hybrid screen using the CC domain as prey. Among these, 129 genes, 57 of which encoded Rabs, were GTPases and belonged to the Rho/Rac/Rab family of small GTPases. We show that several members of the Rac/Rho family are able to bind to p125 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that p125 has the ability to interact with various members of this family. Furthermore, our data indicate a potential role of p125 in cell movement or proliferation. The fact that Rac/Rho GTPases are involved in both cell cycle regulation and cell movement or proliferation in mammalian cells, together with the identification of their interaction with p125, provides some interesting perspectives.<EOD> Interactive and iterative training improves radiotherapy treatment plan quality.\nBACKGROUND\nWhile peer review is advocated for ensuring the quality of radiotherapy (RT) plans, its impact on overall RT treatment plan quality is not well understood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study prospectively evaluated the impact of a process designed to iteratively assess treatment plans and then revise the plans after discussion with members of our clinical team to produce 'target' plans.

The samples are oxidized by permanganate, and the hydrobromic acid formed is oxidized by ammonium persulphate in a cuprammonium complex at pH 10.5, so that the resulting copper(II) ion can be reduced by the potassium iodide-persulphate system in the presence of sodium selenosulphate, to yield a green coloured solution which is then absorbed by means of a cuprammonium compound. The intensity of this colour is proportional to the bromine concentration; it is measured by absorbancy at 725 m\u03bc. The method is very sensitive, there being no interference from potassium bromide, and has been applied to several foodstuffs; recovery rates between 93 and 100% were obtained. The method can be done in a small laboratory provided an analyser for absorbancy at 725 m\u03bc is available.<EOD> The development of the Mini\u2010IAT: Evaluating the measurement properties of a brief version of the IAT in the context of psychosexual development\nThis study sought to examine the use of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) for studying sexual diversity using a shortened \u201cMini\u2010IAT.\u201d Results show that the Mini IAT produces reliable data (see Fig. 1.3), which supports the construct validity of using this measure with sexual minority participants. The Mini IAT demonstrated similar discriminant power to the IAT. Using both measures, the authors were able to show that sexual minority men were more accepting of homosexual men than bisexual men. This article is very important from a developmental point of view because it demonstrates the reliability and validity of an IAT measuring prejudice toward bisexual men. The use of an IAT is highly recommended in research on sexual minority populations to evaluate the acceptance of this population by the heterosexual majority.

If the exclusion criteria in the clinical trial are considered as negative results, or when diseases that appear in the exclusion criteria are considered as negative effects of the treatment, and not as diseases to be treated themselves, they are not considered a reason that the patient cannot be enrolled in the study.\n### B) Is the patient aged between 8 years old and 18 years old?\nThe age criteria may involve age limits or age categories.\nIf the age range of interest for an evaluation does not include ages, e.g., 8-16.99, a patient aged 6 months must be at least 8 years old and cannot be older than 16.99 years old. If the age limit is 8-18 years old, if the patient is less than 8 years old by 6 months, then they are not eligible for that study.\n\n### C) Does the patient have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores from \u22645 to 12?\nGCS is a tool used to define the level of consciousness or the state of consciousness of the patient.\nThere are 15 cases to be assessed, with each possible",

Multislice CT angiography (MSCT) is one of the leading and non-invasive diagnostic methods. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the degree of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and blood-flow parameters of ICA measured basing on MSCT angiography examination. Material and methods: We examined 40 patients hospitalized in the Department of Internal Diseases, Neurology and Angiology, Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. All patients underwent multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA). The degree of hemodynamic compromise of ICA was determined on the basis of measurements of the internal diameter of ICA according to NASCET criteria. Results: There were no significant differences in mean values of blood-flow parameters between patients with less severe (1-30%) internal carotid stenosis and more severe (31-99%) internal carotid stenosis. Conclusions: Patients with less severe internal carotid stenosis and more severe internal carotid stenosis have similar internal diameter of ICA assessed on the basis of multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA). Also patients with less severe internal carotid stenosis and more severe internal carotid stenosis have similar blood-flow and cerebral vascular index (CVI) parameters of ICA measured on the basis of multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA).\n\n# Introduction\nIn the medical literature, one can easily find data about a correlation between stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) and risk of ischemic stroke. According to current reports, 15-20% of all cerebral strokes are the result of ischemia of brain tissue and are caused by sten",

You should find whether this patient should be referred for this trial by reading the trial's inclusion criteria, making a trial-level eligibility for this patient, and finally repeating the eligibility in the last line.\nFor an example of the patient, you should read the following patient note. The patient is 8 year old, has fallen from a bike and has an unconsciousness condition when coming to emergency department.\nAn 8-year-old boy fell from his bike striking his left temple on the pavement. There was no immediate loss of consciousness, and a brief examination at the scene noted his pupils were symmetrical, reactive to the light, and he was moving all four limbs. Half an hour after the fall the child became drowsy, pale, and vomited. He was transferred to the emergency department. Upon arrival the heart rate was 52/min, blood pressure of 155/98. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6/15, the pupils were asymmetrical and movement of the right upper and lower extremities was impaired. The neurosurgical team advised deferring the CT scan in favor of initiating immediate treatment.\n\nWe must use the trial's inclusion criteria, which have some restrictions such as the age range (16-70), the clinical setting (severe head trauma GCS 4-8), and the treatment medication (treated with ABELADRUG200). Then, we should decide whether the 8-year-old is eligible to be referred to this trial. Finally, we should repeat the eligibility in the last line. In the example, the patient note contains the clinical characteristics to be considered in determining if the patient is eligible, and the patient is eligible to be referred to this trial according to the clinical trial's inclusion criteria. If the patient notes do not mention this clinical characteristic, you should assign a score of `Not mentioning the clinical characteristic` on these factors.\nWe will take a look at the following patient note. The patient is a three-year-old boy who fell from his bike, and on the pavement, an 18-",

The patients were aged from 54 to 64 years; 15 male and 16 female. The patients had myelopathy as a result of spondylosis and protrusion or a combination of these and radiculopathy due to spinal trauma, tumor, infection or amyloidosis. Pain, motor deficits and decreased sensitivity in the area of the spine were the main symptoms of the disease. CT myelography is the most efficient procedure for diagnosing spondylotic changes.<EOD> Sucrose promotes leaf senescence and lignification in lime tree\n\nBackground: Sensitivity to sugar shortage is a prerequisite for autumn leaf senescence, because its initiation is closely linked with the cessation of carbon assimilation and cell growth due to unfavourable environmental conditions, and lignification as a key plant defence against pathogens. The role of sugars in this process, however, as well as of other metabolites and hormones, has not been elucidated at the molecular level.Results:The aim of the study was to determine how changes of endogenous metabolism affect autumn leaf senescence. Leaf-stage-specific changes in the contents of a range of metabolites including sugars, organic acids, amino acids and hormones were monitored in leaves of common lime (Tiliqua rugosa) trees after subjecting them repeatedly to a combination of simulated autumn conditions (low photoperiod, low temperature and high sugar) for three",

Objectives: To evaluate the clinical presentation and neurologic complications associated with posterior quadrant epidural abscesses and to explore the potential for decreased mortality or morbidity following treatment with emergent intervention. Methods: Forty-four consecutive patients at a single institution with cultureproven epidural abscesses (eight patients had concomitant infectious dissemination), diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging, who were treated with surgery or antibiotics or both. Patients with postlaminectomy epidural abscess, who had only a single level of involvement and who had undergone prior surgery (laminectomies or discectomies) at the affected level, were excluded.Results: Thirty patients with posterior quadrant epidural abscesses had complete presentations/follow-up: 56.7% of subjects had no neurologic deficits, 20% had severe deficits, and 23.3% had deficits that were incompletely described. Patients with posterior quadrant abscesses had a higher rate of neurologic complications (40%) than those with central epidural abscesses (14.3%, P \u00bc .0585). Patients with severe neurologic complications underwent early epidural abscess drainage or had a higher rate of emergent spinal instrumentation (80% vs 60%, respectively, P \u00bc .34). Of the 18 patients in whom the epidural abscess was treated without emergent surgery, 66.7% had severe neurologic complications. Of the patients who underwent early drainage or early emergent spinal instrumentation, 40% had severe neurologic complications. The rates of neurologic dysfunction among those who were treated with antibiotics (66.7%) and those who were not treated with early surgery (55%) were identical (",

Given that much work has been done to measure smoking behavior, there is a need for the development of a questionnaire to assess e-cigarette behaviors. E-cigarette use, unlike cigarette smoking, may be viewed as a prototypical harm reduction device. Accordingly, a questionnaire to measure e-cigarette use may best be developed as a proxy for cigarette smoking. Methods Our objectives were (1) to develop a short and psychometrically sound questionnaire to measure behavior in smokers, former smokers, never smokers, and dual users (smokers who also use e-cigarettes); (2) to develop a questionnaire to measure the psychometric properties of e-cigarette use that can be used across studies examining the efficacy of e-cigarettes; and (3) to adapt the questionnaire to measure e-cigarette behavior changes that accompany a cessation attempt as a marker of efficacy of e-cigarettes in smoking cigarettes. Results We developed and validated a short version of the questionnaire in a population that consisted of smokers, former smokers, never smokers, and dual users. This questionnaire was able to measure behavior changes that were associated with an e-cigarette cessation attempt. Conclusions We developed new questionnaires to assess e-cigarette use in smoking cessation attempts and in e-cigarette prevention trials. Application of Measure This questionnaire can be used in cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, and intervention studies to measure e-cigarette use as a marker of cigarette smoking cessation and as a target for preventing cigarette smoking",

BACKGROUND: Antigen presented by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII), produced by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), represents the first line of defense. Furthermore, IEC express a large variety of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) which may be involved in mucosal protection. IEC-derived cytokines including interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 7 and interleukin (IL) 15 are required for protective Th1 immunity and activation of memory T cells, but the exact mechanism remains elucidated. IEC-secreted chemokines (e.g., CXCL9, CXLC10, CXCL11, CXCL13 and CX3CR1) and cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members (TNFSF)) may recruit and activate adaptive effector immune cells such as CD8+ lymphocytes. Recruitment to the intestine of Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as dendritic cells, can be mediated by IEC",

These minimally invasive procedures are well tolerated, often providing immediate symptom relief, and present acceptable rates of complications and mortality. Various thermal ablative devices and techniques are currently applied in clinical practice, but high temperatures are frequently encountered in the tissues at short ablative times in contact mode treatments, especially in fatty tissues. This is because the target tissue is not the most sensitive one to heat, and large thermal gradients are generated due to the heat dissipation of surrounding tissues.

The Nutrition Assessment and Diagnosis Tool (NADT), a new, comprehensive method for individualised nutrition risk assessment, classifies patients into one of five categories: adequate, at risk, at risk for preventing weight loss or increasing weight, at risk for excessive weight loss, and at risk for preventing excessive weight gain. The NADT was developed based on analysis of existing dietary assessment methods and data from a large clinical study. It encompasses four components: 1) the Patient Diet Recall to assess habitual food intake; 2) Laboratory and Physical Characteristics to assess metabolic stress",

In North America, Ixodes scapularis is the main vector causing babesiosis, anaplasmosis and lyme borreliosis, which are three major tick-borne endemic diseases on which several works recently focused. Most of these works used a molecular approach and showed that tick salivary gland proteins (SGPs), secreted in the saliva to facilitate blood feeding, are involved in biodiversity and bacterial transmission. Here we hypothesized that molecules involved in tissue adhesion and hemolysis are also involved in transmission. In this work, we therefore took advantage of our transcriptomic data on I.scapularis salivary gland and focused on a set of 796 SGP transcripts, of which 279 encode proteins with the potential to interact with several biological molecules: 134 proteins contain cysteine-rich domains (CRD) and 208 contain transmembrane domains (TMD). We then checked whether these transcripts were present in I. scapularis life stages with various bacterial loads, using RT-qPCR for I. ricinus, the model species for european ticks. A subset of the CRD-encoding transcripts was indeed present in embryos with or without bacterial endosymbionts, while several CRD transcripts and the TMD transcripts were present exclusively in ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Ixodes scapularis and I. ricinus share the same bacterial endosymbionts and therefore the TMD sub-family could be used as an important molecular marker to identify infected ticks.\nTicks are blood-feeding arthropods that feed periodically on mammals.

        "output": "<EOD> The effect of phosphorylation on mitochondrial proteins: A study in the rat heart.\nMyocardial ischemia results in the phosphorylation of multiple proteins within the cardiomyocyte. Underlying cause of ischemia-induced phosphorylation of proteins is unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that ischemia-induced phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins was primarily due to phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase inhibition. This hypothesis was tested by administration of inhibitors specific to these two protein kinases in the mitoplast and permeabilized cell models. Our results from the mitoplast model demonstrate that ischemia produced phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins. Exogenous cAMP (0.015, 0.15 and 1.5 mM) induced no change in mitochondrial protein phosphorylation. On the other hand, the presence of an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (okadaic acid; 10(-7) M) dramatically increased protein phosphorylation. These results were confirmed in the permeabilized cell model. Ischemia did not produce any change in protein phosphorylation. Exogenous addition of AMP significantly decreased protein phosphorylation while adenylate kinase activity or adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) depletion had no effect on protein phosphorylation. It appears that only when mitochondrial function is severely inhibited, such as in the presence of okadaic acid, does the mitochondrial protein become phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is most likely due to the inactivation of mitochondrial protein phosphatase-1.<EOD> Influence of age and sex on total body and segmental fat estimates by DXA in normal adults.\nDual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a well-established, radiation-free, non-invasive method for the determination of adipose tissue content and body composition in adults.

        "output": "Good Luck!\n<EOD> \nThe epidemiological data obtained in Russia and other countries of the world, and the own results of the study of the peculiarities of the human microbiota (gut microbiota) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) indicate that a number of microorganisms which do not belong to pathogenic biologic agents are associated with it. Despite a lot of researches aimed to identify the causal relationship, pathogenetic mechanisms of involvement of the various factors in the development of CHF remain poorly understood. At the same time, it is known that the gut microbiota is involved in almost all body processes, and its impaired composition has a significant negative impact on the development of many diseases. The review of the literature data made it possible to determine that the pathology of the human microbiota is directly associated with the severity of CHF, and, conversely, the severity of CHF affects the composition and functioning of the microbiota. A number of studies on the effect of different drugs (including digoxin, dobutamine and udenafil) on the abundance of different groups of microorganisms in patients with CHF has shown that the administration of these drugs affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Further studies of this problem could provide a new target for the treatment of patients with CHF, and the selection of proper biological drugs to correct the composition of the microbiota in such patients could be a significant breakthrough in the treatment of this disease.<EOD> .\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment on the repair of spinal nerve root transection and the relationship between HBO treatment and the expression of TGF-beta 1.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty four SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, including normal group, sham-operated group and the HBO treatment group.

EDSS is a type of CDSS that aids researchers in automating the eligibility decision or recruitment of the target population as close as possible. EDSS is designed to enhance clinical trial recruitment and improve data quality and analysis capabilities, thus facilitating clinical trial management at a reduced cost.\nWhile the eligibility assessment is usually performed by humans, EDSS uses automated computer algorithms and data mining to mimic humans. Although EDSS cannot replace the assessment by knowledgeable human experts during clinical trial eligibility, EDSS can assist in assessing the eligibility of patients using data recorded so far. The assessment of eligibility by EDSS can be an effective tool because it can be time-consuming to manually evaluate the eligibility of every participant in the clinical trial.\nEDSS requires the following two steps before assessing the eligibility of a particular patient:1) Identifying the set of records representing all eligible patients, i.e., patient data that satisfy the inclusion criteria and do not satisfy the exclusion criteria 2) Finding out the most influential inclusion criteria for the assessment of eligibility.\nIn this exercise, try to construct an EDSS of your own and compare with a published one.\n\n[END]\n[END]\n<EOD> HIV-associated cytomegalovirus retinit",

To explore the spectrum and natural history of bacteremia caused by M. kansasii in people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we examined the clinical histories of 63 patients with histologically documented M. kansasii bacteremia (36 HIV-seropositive and 27 -seronegative cases). Patients with M. kansasii bacteremia were characterized by low CD4 cell counts (less than 90/\u03bcL) and frequent disseminated infection and death. Seropositive patients had significantly shorter durations of fever (P = .0006), anemia (P = .0002), weight loss (P = .01), and leukopenia (P = .0008), a higher initial mean C-reactive protein value (P = .005), and 57% fewer cultures positive for HIV (P = .01). Our findings suggest that opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment of patients with M. kansasii bacteremia may be enhanced by the presence of HIV infection.<EOD> Association between physical activities at a young age and cardiovascular risk factors among adolescents in a high school in Kuwait\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in",

The 5-HT synthesis pathway is mainly regulated by the availability of TRP and the expression levels of various synthetic enzymes. Because TRP is required for protein and neuronal synthesis and various TRP-utilizing pathways, a deficit of TRP is involved in memory process in various brain diseases. Many types of research have been performed to understand the roles of 5-HT and TRP in the memory process. Furthermore, therapeutic uses of 5-HT and TRP in some brain diseases have provided some evidence for their memory enhancing role in cognitive function. In this review, we discuss the functions of 5-HT and TRP in normal and pathological memory processes based on the present studies.\n\n## The synthesis pathway of 5-ht and trp in the brain\nSerotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system, is synthesized from L-tryptophan (TRP) utilizing the following pathway in the central nervous system (CNS): 1) L-TRP is converted to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH); 2) 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptamine (5-HT) by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC); and 3) finally, 5-HT is released from presynaptic terminals into the synaptic cleft, where it binds to various 5-HT 1 to 5 receptors. The synthesis is mediated by the serotonin synthesis pathway in the CNS, and it is largely regulated by the availability of TRP, which is also required in protein and neuronal synthesis",
