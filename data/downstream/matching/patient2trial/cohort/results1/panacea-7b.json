As the most commonly identified genetic cause of obesity, PWS is often confused with Early-onset Morbid Obesity (EMO). Individuals with EMO show some signs of PWS, but clinically do not have PWS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical features and genetic basis of PWS and EMO, and to determine how these conditions affect a person throughout a lifetime.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nIndividuals enrolling in the Prader-Willi syndrome group will have a confirmed diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, as confirmed by molecular and cytogenetic testing\nIndividuals enrolling in the Early-onset Morbid Obesity group will have a documented medical history of their weight exceeding 150% of the ideal body weight or a body mass index greater than 97% before the age of 4 years; they will also be under the age of 30 years.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 40-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to the ER with excruciating pain in her right arm that had started 1 hour prior to her admission. She denies trauma. On examination she is pale and in moderate discomfort, as well as tachypneic and tachycardic. Her body temperature is normal and her blood pressure is 80/60. Her right arm has no discoloration or movement limitation.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Focal Hand Dystonia\n\n\nSummary: Background:~The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information about movement disorders.~Focal hand dystonia, also known as writer's cramp or musician's cramp, is a painful condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand dystonia.~Objectives:~- To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.~Eligibility:~Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand dystonia.~Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.~This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to 5 hours.~Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.~In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst. Participants will have multiple bursts during the test.

Emergency physicians subjectively complain of stress related to changes in work shifts. Several potential biomarkers of stress have been described, but never investigated in emergency physician, who may represent a good model of stress due to the complex interplay between stress (life-and-death emergencies, which is the defining characteristic of their job), lack of sleep and fatigue due to repeated changes in shifts.The aim of this study was to compare biomarkers in emergency physicians working a 24-hour shift (24hS) or a 14-hour night shift (14hS), and in those working a control day (clerical work on return from leave). We also followed these markers three days following each shift (D3/24hS and D3/14hS).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nemergency physician\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

The aetiology of AA is still poor understood: the commonest hypothesis refers to appendix obstruction followed by impairment of wall appendix barrier and thus wall perforation and/or abscess formation1. However some studies suggest that no-complicate and complicate appendicitis are different entities allowing a different treatment. The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode of AA.The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode of AA.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\npatients between 18 and 65 years old\nfirst episode of suspected AA diagnosed by Andersson's score or combination with abdominal ultrasound\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

The main goal being to examine the number of days required following stenting in order to have significant improvement in dysphagia and the length of time that this baseline is maintained. Approximately 100 patients will be prospectively enrolled in this study.~Patients with end stage inoperable esophageal cancer deemed candidates for intraluminal esophageal palliative stent insertion will be prospectively enrolled into the study. Patients with esophageal obstruction or stricture due to other benign causes, tumors obstructing the cervical esophagus, as well as patients with airway-esophageal fistulas will be excluded from the study.~The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of intra-esophageal stent insertion to improve malignant dysphagia as a main factor affecting the quality of life in these patients.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAll patients with end stage inoperable esophageal cancer deemed candidates for intraluminal esophageal palliative stent insertions.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 32-year-old woman is admitted to the ER following a car accident. She has sustained multiple injuries including upper and lower extremity fractures. She is fully awake and alert, and she reports that she was not wearing a seat belt. Her blood pressure is 134/74 mm Hg, and her pulse is 87/min. Physical examination reveals a tender abdomen with guarding and rebound in all four quadrants. She has no bowel sounds.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Teenage Driving Safety Study: An Emergency Medicine-Trauma Collaborative Study\n\n\nSummary: Teenage driving safety continues to be a major public health issue. Two factors have been found to contribute to a higher teenage driving accident rate than adults: lack of driving experience, and risky behaviors. Insufficient driving experience puts teenagers at a disadvantage in detecting and responding to hazards while driving. Factors contributing to distracted driving (a diversion in the driver's attention from the road) may include: talking or text messaging on a cell phone, applying makeup, having multiple passengers, listening to loud music, eating/drinking, smoking or reading while driving.~This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the effect of an educational program on the risks associated with distracted driving for teenage drivers. The researchers will compare cell phone usage behaviors in Pennsylvania, where no cell phone laws are in place, and New Jersey, where cell phone laws exist, and will educate the beginner driver on the potential dangers associated with driving without a seat belt, substance use, and participating in distracting driving behaviors. Knowledge of state laws will also be assessed.~Objectives~Educate participants on the potential dangers of distracted driving.~Evaluate the impact of the educational program on teenage distracted driving behaviors by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, state law quizzes, and anonymous observation, pre, post, and delayed post education.~Quantify distracted driving behavior in teenage driver's attending local area high schools by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, state law quizzes, and anonymous observation, pre, post, and delayed post education.~Qualify distracted driving behavior in teenage driver's attending local area high schools by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, anonymous observation, and anonymous voicemails, text messages, and/or emails pre, post, and delayed post education.~Qualify distracted driving behavior in adults through anonymous observations near local area high schools.~6. Compare teenage driving behaviors as reported and observed between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.~7. Compare seat belt usage, driving behaviors, and substance use in the study population to the state and national averages pre and post education.~8. Compare averages of student's knowledge of state driving laws pre and post education.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nTeenagers perceived to be students driving near school property.\nTeenagers perceived to be of driving age.\nTeens in 10th, 11th, and 12th grades attending Phillipsburg, Southern Lehigh, Freedom and Liberty High Schools.\nAny driver driving near school property, which is perceived to be older than of high school age.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

On examination she is found to have alopecia, a rash mainly distributed on the bridge of her nose and her cheeks, a delicate non-palpable purpura on her calves, and swelling and tenderness of her wrists and ankles. Her lab shows normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, a 4/4 positive ANA and anti-dsDNA. Her urine is positive for protein and RBC casts.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: GENetic & Immunologic Abnomalies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\n\nSummary: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease for which the aetiology includes genet-ic and environmental factors. It is rare in children as compared to adults. The severity may be related to greater involvement of genetic factors in children. The impact of genetics in the development of SLE is important, and the risk of recurrence in siblings evaluated by lambda S ratio is 30 in SLE, while it is 15 for type-1 diabetes and 8 rheumatoid arthritis, thereby indicating high impact of genetics in SLE.~Recently, the group of Professor Yanick Crow in Manchester and other teams has identified new forms of lupus Mendelian genetics. The TREX1 and genes involved in the SAMHD1 frostbite lupus.~Nearly 2 % of all adult subjects with SLE have a heterozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene, which therefore represents the first genetic cause of SLE. The team of Professor Crow also identified the ACP5 gene that is responsible for SLE associated with Spondylo-epiphyseal enchondro-epiphyseal dysplasia (syndromic lupus). Other groups have identified mutations in two genes encoding a DNAse (DNAse1 and DNAse1L3) responsible for familial monogenic forms of SLE. These new genes SLE were identified through research of germ-line mutations in cases of lupus syndromic or family. In collaboration with Professor Crow, we are currently undergoing characterization of a novel gene of SLE in a family and we have identified a second locus identified in another family. The identification of these genes provides a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance in humans. The frequency of these genetic forms is not known. There is very little data on the immunological phenotype of these patients.~This is a clinical study to investigate the genetic and immunological abnormalities associated with pediatric SLE. The aim are to:~study the genetics of pediatric SLE (or syndromic or family) and to search for mutations in the known genetic lupus or new genes in collaboration with Professor Yanick Crow.~study the lymphocyte subpopulations and serum cytokines in pediatric patients with SLE (or syndromic or family) in the large Rh\u00f4ne- Alpes- Auvergne area.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMale or female subject, major or minor of any age with SLE (defined according to the ACR criteria)\nOnset pediatric (<18 years) OR\nSyndromic Lupus (associated with growth retardation, neurological deficit not related to lupus, frostbite, lymphoproliferation, the kidney malformations, heart, lung, brain calcifications) OR\nLupus in context with familial consanguinity OR\nFamilial cases (2 cases of SLE related first degree relative) OR related topic of the first degree to a lupus patient participant (if family lupus or related parents) OR\nmother/father's lupus patient (in cas of simplex lupus)\nA person or beneficiary entitled to a social security scheme or similar\nInformed consent signed by the person (or parent / holding parental authority for minors)\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 15-year-old girl presents to the ER with abdominal pain. The pain appeared gradually and was periumbilical at first, localizing to the right lower quadrant over hours. She has had no appetite since yesterday but denies diarrhea. She has had no sexual partners and her menses are regular. On examination, she has localized rebound tenderness over the right lower quadrant. On an abdominal ultrasound, a markedly edematous appendix is seen.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Fast Track Appendectomy for Suppurative Appendicitis\n\n\nSummary: The literature has reported that fast track surgery can be safely applied to children undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis. There is no current evidence regarding the application of same day discharge protocol in children with intra-operative findings of suppurative appendicitis. The current standard of care for patients who present with intra-operative findings of suppurative appendicitis includes post-operative admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Patients are discharged home once they have met the following discharge criteria: temperature less than 38.5 degrees Celsius, pain control with oral pain medication, and tolerating a liquid diet. Given the evidence in the literature that has shown that same day discharge of patients with acute appendicitis is safe and effective, we propose that fast track surgery protocol can be safely applied to patients with intraoperative findings of suppurative appendicitis. We hypothesize that this will result in a decreased postoperative length of stay, without an increase in 30-day complication rate.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPediatric patients aged 5-18\nDiagnosis of appendicitis and scheduled for appendectomy during the hours of 0600-1800.\nIntraoperative findings of suppurative appendicitis\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 63-year-old man presents with cough and shortness of breath. His past medical history is notable for heavy smoking, spinal stenosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism and mild psoriasis. He also has a family history of early onset dementia. His symptoms began about a week prior to his admission, with productive cough, purulent sputum and difficulty breathing, requiring him to use his home oxygen for the past 24 hours. He denies fever. On examination he is cyanotic, tachypneic, with a barrel shaped chest and diffuse rales over his lungs. A chest x-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Predictive Questionnaires for Risk of Acute COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Exacerbations\n\n\nSummary: COPD patients frequently suffer intermittent exacerbations of their disease characterised by acute deterioration of symptoms. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with significant impairment of health status, use of health care resources, poor prognosis and increased mortality. The development of simple and practical predictive tools would help to identify COPD patients at greater risk of suffering exacerbations, which is important since those patients would need more intense and early treatment.~This one-year prospective cohort non-drug study will evaluate several COPD-specific questionnaires as predictive tools and the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities as risk factors, for the composite events in study cohorts. The trial duration consists of a screening period (4-6 weeks) and a follow-up period (12 months), 4 visits in total along the study.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nSigned informed consent\nAge \u2265 40 years\nPatients fulfilling criteria for COPD according to the Global initiative for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD) stage I or higher\nSmokers or ex-smokers of at least 10 pack-years\nPatients suffering an AECOPD either:\nAdmitted to hospital due to AECOPD (severe exacerbation) or\nConfirmed AECOPD at GP (general practitioner) setting (moderate exacerbation) Definition AECOPD: Increase in respiratory symptoms requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics or both.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old nonsmoker white female with mild exertional dyspnea and occasional cough is found to have a left lung mass on chest x-ray. She is otherwise asymptomatic. A neurologic examination is unremarkable, but a CT scan of the head shows a solitary mass in the right frontal lobe.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Sertraline for the Treatment of Patients With Frontal Lobe Dementia (FLD)\n\n\nSummary: Dementia refers to a condition where there is a loss of intellectual function (cognition). It is usually a progressive condition that interferes with normal social and occupational activities.~Patients with frontal lobe dementia (FLD) suffer from a destruction of the brain cells found in the frontal lobe of the brain. Loss of frontal lobe neurons can cause changes in personality, such as aggressiveness, agitation, and depression. In addition, patients with FLD may have difficulty planning tasks and may have a loss of motivation.~Researchers believe that the cells lost in the frontal lobe of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, which means it is used by neurons to communicate with other neurons. Researchers are inclined to believe that by replacing the missing serotonin, symptoms of FLD may be relieved.~Drugs known as serotonin uptake inhibitors, help to maintain high levels of serotonin in the body. They have been used successfully to treat patients with depression and patients with violent / impulsive behaviors. Sertraline is a serotonin reuptake blocker that is relatively easy to give (once daily), is safer than most other serotonin reuptake blockers (very little effect on vital enzyme systems [cytochrome P-450]), and has few interactions with other drugs.~This study is designed to test the effectiveness of Sertraline for the treatment of symptoms associated with FLD. Patients participating in the study will receive Sertraline for 6 weeks and a placebo inactive sugar pill for 6 weeks. During the study, researchers will test psychological and neurological functions to measure the effects of the drug.\nInclusion criteria: Characterized as having behavioral manifestations using a standardized neuropsychiatric scale and interview.\nFLD patients' frontal cognitive sysfunctions characterized using a short neurobehavioral test battery.\nPatients must be able to be tested and cooperative with the procedures required in this protocol.\nNo contraindications to the use of Sertraline.\nNo medical conditions that can reasonably be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk (e.g., cancer) or require frequent changes in medication. Well-controlled medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes will not be excluded.\nPatients must not be pregnant or nursing and must be using effective contraception, if still at child-bearing age.\nNo history of prior severe traumatic brain injury or other severe neurologic or psychiatric condition, such as psychosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury.\nNot using any psychotropic medication which cannot be stopped 4 weeks before the study.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 56-year-old female on 20th day post-left mastectomy presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and malaise. The patient says that she has remained in bed for the last two weeks. The physical examination reveals tenderness on the left upper thoracic wall and right calf.

In particular, we are interested in how medical innovations diffuse throughout social networks. We wish to examine the diffusion of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) use for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) throughout the social network of general internal medicine interns, residents, and attendings at the University of Chicago Hospital. In numerous clinical trials, LMWH has been demonstrated to be as effective as unfractionated heparin as a bridge to long-term anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin, with the added benefit of early discharge from the hospital with easy dosing, no need for monitoring, and home therapy. A DVT critical pathway was established at the U of C in 1998, and LMWH was used off-label for that purpose beginning in 1997. However, it is unclear how quickly the use of LMWH was adopted by the physicians on the general medicine services, or whether there exists a pattern for this adoption.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients admitted to General Medicine Services with a primary or secondary diagnosis related to venous thromboembolism\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

The inclusion criteria for the clinical trial state:\n   - Intubated patients (with and without mechanical ventilator support) with secretion 1.5 ml/h\n   - Clinical or radiologic diagnosis of pulmonary infection or chronic airway inflammation disease such as pneumonia, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic bronchitis with signs of secretion accumulation such as medium-coarse crackle, wheezing, persistent rhonchi, and decrease breath sound\n   - Stable of cardiopulmonary function at least 2 days before the study and not receiving vasopressors drug within 5 days before collecting the data\n   - Stable of hydration status or positive fluid balance at least 2 days before collecting the data\n   - Able to breathe or tolerate spontaneously breathing trial with T-piece at least 2 minutes with fraction of inspired oxygen < 0.4 and without developing hypoxemia\n   - Good conscious and well cooperation\n\n3. Comparing the patient's information to the inclusion criteria, we can see that the patient does not meet the criteria for the clinical trial. The patient is not intubated, and the note does not mention any clinical or radiologic diagnosis of pulmonary infection or any signs of secretion accumulation. The patient also has a history of surgery, which may be excluded from the trial. Additionally, the patient's shortness of breath and D-dimer elevation suggest a possible pulmonary embolism, which is not related to the study's focus on airway secretion clearance and lung function.\n\n4.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 26-year-old obese woman with a history of bipolar disorder complains that her recent struggles with her weight and eating have caused her to feel depressed. She states that she has recently had difficulty sleeping and feels excessively anxious and agitated. She also states that she has had thoughts of suicide. She often finds herself fidgety and unable to sit still for extended periods of time. Her family tells her that she is increasingly irritable. Her current medications include lithium carbonate and zolpidem.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Prevention of Weight Gain in Early Psychoses\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with psychotic spectrum disorders ( Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder,Schizophreniform Disorder, Bipolar Disorder (Type I),Bipolar Disorder (Type II),Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features,Substance-Induced Psychoses,Psychosis Not-Otherwise-Specified (NOS)randomly assigned to a stepped behavioral intervention for the prevention of weight gain will experience less weight gain than individuals who receive usual care. There are several studies that have examined the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological behavioural approaches for weight loss in patients with psychosis, however studies examining strategies for prevention of obesity are lacking. This study is an important and novel approach to studying the problem of obesity in those with psychosis.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge between 14 and 45 years (inclusive)\nMale or Female gender\nDSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder,Schizophreniform Disorder, Bipolar Disorder (Type I),Bipolar Disorder (Type II), Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features, Substance-Induced Psychoses, Psychosis Not-Otherwise-Specified (NOS)\nOutpatient status at the time of randomization\nDuration of antipsychotic treatment of less than 5 years\nAbility to provide informed consent\nFemale patients of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted means of contraception\nTreatment with olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine,risperidone or paliperidone for less than 8 weeks duration at enrollment\nBMI between 18.5 and 30\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 26-year-old obese woman with a history of bipolar disorder complains that her recent struggles with her weight and eating have caused her to feel depressed. She states that she has recently had difficulty sleeping and feels excessively anxious and agitated. She also states that she has had thoughts of suicide. She often finds herself fidgety and unable to sit still for extended periods of time. Her family tells her that she is increasingly irritable. Her current medications include lithium carbonate and zolpidem.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: The GlasVEGAS Study (Glasgow Visceral & Ectopic Fat With Weight Gain in South AsianS)\n\n\nSummary: South Asians have a much higher risk of diabetes compared to Europeans and investigators don't know why this is. Investigators think that South Asians' capacity to store fat safely under the skin is lower than Europeans, so they start to store fat around internal organs and in liver and muscle, and at lower body weights than Europeans. These increased levels of internal fat storage are thought to increase risk of diabetes.~The purpose of the study therefore is to investigate whether there are differences with weight gain and weight loss in fat storage, fat cell function and metabolic risk factors, in South Asians compared with Europeans. Investigators will compare South Asian and European men at the start of the study, after they have gained about 7% body weight, and again after they have lost 7-15% body weight (from peak weight) to see how gaining and losing weight affects fat storage within the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also assess the effect of weight gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nParticipants will be men of European (self-report of both parents of white European origin) or South Asian (self-report of both parents of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Sri Lankan origin) with BMI <25 kg.m-2, who have been weight stable (\u00b1 2 kg) for >6 months.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 44-year-old man was recently in an automobile accident where he sustained a skull fracture. In the emergency room, he noted clear fluid dripping from his nose. The following day he started complaining of severe headache and fever. Nuchal rigidity was found on physical examination.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Bedside Sedation for the Prevention of Post Dural Puncture Headache\n\n\nSummary: Dural or lumbar puncture (LP), the passing of a needle into the space of the spinal cord, is a common procedure in everyday clinical practice. The most common use for LP is to measure the spinal fluid pressure and sample spinal fluid for laboratory analysis. However, it is also used for therapeutic purposes, such as administering chemotherapy or spinal anesthesia.~A notorious side effect of dural puncture is headache that ranges from mild to debilitating and may last for several days following the procedure. Among diagnosed patients, 39% experience at least 1 week of impaired ability to perform activities of daily living. The likelihood of developing a headache after dural puncture depends on a number of factors. As fluid leak is assumed to be the culprit mechanism in this headache strategies to minimize the leak seem to offer the best path to lowering the incidence of headache after diagnostic LP, the commonest clinical context of dural puncture in medical practice.~Lumbar puncture is a highly stressful event for most patients. As both pain and anxiety cause adrenergic stimulation, they also cause an increase in ICP. We believe that this mild increase in ICP, occurring before the puncture as well as during the puncture itself may exacerbate the pressure difference between the CSF space and the epidural space and so worsen the CSF leak Furthermore, this excess pressure, although mild, might cause the dural puncture hole to widen slightly and so further augment the leak and possibly even prolong it. Furthermore, the very anticipation of pain causes a rise in neurotransmitters that may cause a sensitization effect and worsen pain. This increase in adrenergic drive as well as the sensitization to pain can be effectively blunted by the periprocedural use of mild IV sedation. Benzodiazepines, with their sedative-hypnotic qualities are well suited for this task.~This study aims to test the effect of mild peri-procedural IV sedation using Midazolam on the rates of headache after diagnostic LP.~Patients undergoing a diagnostic LP will be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will undergo the procedure as routinely practiced. Group 2 will be given Midazolam IV 10-5 minutes prior to the procedure and undergo the same diagnostic procedure. All patients in the study will remain under observation in the hospital for at least 6 hours.~Patients will be evaluated for headache and specifically for headache. Clinical follow up will continue for 72 hours by administering a short questionnaire over the telephone.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n18-50 years old\nUndergoing diagnostic LP for any indication for the first time\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

O2 sats are 100% on room air.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Viral Inception of Asthma: Prospective Study From Infancy to School-age\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to study prospectively the early clinical and immunological events in children susceptible to rhinovirus induced early wheezing (i.e., recently found highest risk factor for recurrent wheezing/asthma) and the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid to modify these events.~Up to 50% of children suffer from acute wheezing before school-age. The prevalence of childhood asthma is 5-7%. Although pediatric asthma is mainly allergic, the exacerbations are associated with respiratory viral infections in 95% of cases. The means to predict asthma from environmental factors have been limited mainly to sensitization to aeroallergens (3-fold risk), which start to develop usually at 2-3 years of age. VINKU 1-study (orig. VINKU-study) discovered simultaneously with two other groups, that early wheezing associated with rhinovirus, the common cold virus, is the strongest predictor of recurrent wheezing/asthma (up to 10-fold risky). Noteworthily, viral infections work as risk markers already during infancy, a lot earlier than the sensitization to aeroallergens. The investigators also found retrospectively that early wheezers affected by rhinovirus responded to 3 day course of oral prednisolone (inexpensive and widely available treatment): recurrent wheezing decreased by 50% during following 12 months and the difference appeared to continue. VINKU 5V-study is currently investigating the clinical history, prevalence of asthma and airway hyperreactivity of these same children at school-age. The mechanism of rhinovirus associated risk or why they respond to prednisolone are largely unknown. However, the susceptibility to rhinovirus infections is associated with atopy and therefore it is possible these children may have impaired anti-inflammatory (Treg) responses and more likely to wheeze with any pro-inflammatory response (Th1 or Th2). Moreover, they may not effectively clear viruses, because they can not limit rhinovirus to nose and it spreads to lower airways and causes wheezing. VINKU 2-study will prospectively investigate the immunological events in young first-time wheezers affected by rhinovirus, and prospectively study the clinical efficacy of systemic corticosteroid in them. Most likely these children will benefit from the drug in terms of less recurrent wheezing, the investigators will also explore immunological effects of the drug and their link to clinical efficacy. The results are expected to give basis for the prevention of asthma and for the development of new treatment strategies and they can be directly applied to clinical medicine.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nage 3-23 months\nbe delivered at >=37 weeks\nfirst wheezing episode\nwritten informed consent from guardian\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 4 year old boy presents to the emergency room with wheezing. He has had a history of allergic rhinitis, but no history of wheezing. His mother reports that 5 hours ago patient was playing in the backyard sandbox when she heard him suddenly start coughing. The coughing lasted only moments, but he has been audibly wheezing since. Mother was concerned, because his breathing has not returned to normal, so she brought him to the ED. On exam, the child is playful and well appearing. Wheezing is heard in the mid-right chest area. O2 sats are 100% on room air.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Upper Airway Microbial Development During the First Year of Life\n\n\nSummary: This study tests the hypothesis that an increase in pathogenic bacteria within the infant airway leads to increased airway inflammation, decreased airway function and ultimately airway obstruction throughout the first one to two years of life.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMoms age 14 and older (will sign Informed Consent Statement (ICS), not an assent)\nMother of child enrolled must have a physician diagnosis of asthma or being treated for asthma (for 140 subjects; 40 subjects will be recruited from mothers and fathers without atopy - asthma, eczema, seasonal allergies)\nChild must be enrolled during first week of life\nSigned informed consent from parent(s) or legal guardian(s)\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

She reports no complaints and is in general good health. The results of her PAP were cytology negative, HPV positive.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Follow-up Study of GSK Biologicals' Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine to Prevent Cervical Infection in Young Adults\n\n\nSummary: Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This is an observer blind follow up study of the study HPV-001, which evaluated the ability of the HPV vaccine to prevent HPV infection. The current study invites all of the 1113 subjects in the HPV-001 study that received all three doses of vaccine/placebo to be enrolled and followed-up for several additional years to see if the HPV vaccine prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and to evaluate the safety of the vaccine. Subjects will remain in the same study group as in the primary study. No vaccine or placebo will be administered in this study.~The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nParticipated in study 580299/001 and received all three doses of vaccine/placebo.\nWritten informed consent obtained from the subject prior to enrollment\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Culture of the sputum revealed an organism with septated, low-angle branching hyphae that had straight, parallel walls.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Cross-sectional Characterization of Idiopathic Bronchiectasis\n\n\nSummary: Background:~- Bronchiectasis is a type of lung condition in which the lungs airways are abnormally stretched and widened. This stretching and widening makes it difficult for mucus and other substances to move out of the lungs, encouraging the growth of bacteria and leading to breathing problems or infection. Bronchiectasis can be caused by genetic disorders or diseases such as tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers are interested in developing better ways to diagnose and treat a lung problem called idiopathic or unexplained bronchiectasis.~Objectives:~- To better describe the physical characteristics, radiographic patterns, and airway microbiology of unexplained bronchiectasis and to look for possible genetic links or risk factors.~Eligibility:~Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a chronic cough and who have had a CT scan that has revealed signs of bronchiectasis.~Current smokers or those who have smoked for at least 10 years, as well as individuals who have known causes of bronchiectasis or who have had organ transplants, are not eligible to participate.~Design:~Participants will have one outpatient clinic visit for evaluation with a physical examination including detailed body size measurements and medical history and for collection of blood samples for routine lab tests and genetic analyses and a chest x-ray if no recent one is available.~Participants will also have tests of lung function, and measurement of a gas called nitric oxide in the nose. Participants whose initial tests show abnormal results may also be asked to have a nasal scrape to collect cell samples and/or a skin sweat test to measure salt concentrations.~Participants will also have a sputum specimen collected during the visit and will be asked to collect two additional early morning sputum samples and a mouth rinse at home within 2 weeks of the clinic visit, and mail the sample collection materials to the research team....\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nThe criteria for participants to enter the study mandates that each patient have received a standard (current clinical practice) diagnostic evaluation that includes a CT scan of the chest to document bronchiectasis, prior to enrolling in the Consortium study. To enter this protocol, adults must have bronchiectasis and meet the following criteria:\nMales or females, age greater than or equal to18 years\nChronic cough\nAn available CT of the chest (on a CD) that shows evidence of dilated airways fulfilling radiographic criteria for bronchiectasis in more than one lobe\nAbility to provide informed consent, including HIPAA consent\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nA participant should not be in the study if they have not had a standard clinical evaluation to rule out other potential causes of chronic sino-pulmonary disease.\nKnown diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with classic clinical presentation and elevated sweat chloride levels and/or two known disease-causing CFTR mutations\nHistory of tuberculosis or other known explanation for bronchiectasis, such as alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (ZZ or ZS), confirmed or probable PCD, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren s syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or documented primary or acquired immunodeficiency\nCurrent smoker or > 10 pack-year history of tobacco use\nPrior solid organ transplant\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients with refractory neuroblastoma. A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.~Objectives~Primary:",
