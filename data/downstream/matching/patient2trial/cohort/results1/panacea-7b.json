As the most commonly identified genetic cause of obesity, PWS is often confused with Early-onset Morbid Obesity (EMO). Individuals with EMO show some signs of PWS, but clinically do not have PWS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical features and genetic basis of PWS and EMO, and to determine how these conditions affect a person throughout a lifetime.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nIndividuals enrolling in the Prader-Willi syndrome group will have a confirmed diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, as confirmed by molecular and cytogenetic testing\nIndividuals enrolling in the Early-onset Morbid Obesity group will have a documented medical history of their weight exceeding 150% of the ideal body weight or a body mass index greater than 97% before the age of 4 years; they will also be under the age of 30 years.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 40-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to the ER with excruciating pain in her right arm that had started 1 hour prior to her admission. She denies trauma. On examination she is pale and in moderate discomfort, as well as tachypneic and tachycardic. Her body temperature is normal and her blood pressure is 80/60. Her right arm has no discoloration or movement limitation.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Focal Hand Dystonia\n\n\nSummary: Background:~The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information about movement disorders.~Focal hand dystonia, also known as writer's cramp or musician's cramp, is a painful condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand dystonia.~Objectives:~- To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.~Eligibility:~Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand dystonia.~Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.~This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to 5 hours.~Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.~In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst. Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.~Treatment for focal hand dystonia will not be provided as part of this study.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nConfirmed diagnosis of focal hand dystonia (patients only).\nBetween age 18 and 70 years.\nAble to give informed consent\nRight handed\nAgrees to not drink caffeine or alcohol for 48 hours before study session.\nNo open scalp wounds or scalp infections.\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nHas used illegal drugs within the past 6 months based on history, including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, etc. The intent is to exclude those with drug use that may affect study results. Participants who appear to be intoxicated at the time of testing will be rescheduled.\nHas more than 7 alcoholic drinks a week in the case of a woman and 14 alcoholic drinks a week in the case of a man.\nAbnormal findings on neurologic exam (other than dystonia in patient group)\nHas had a brain tumor, a stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy or a history of seizures.\nHas major depression or any major mental disorders (axis I disorders)\nHas a neurologic disorder other than dystonia\nHas had a head injury where there was a loss of consciousness for more than a few seconds.\nHas a pacemaker, intracardiac lines, implanted pumps or stimulators, or has metal objects inside the eye or skull.

Emergency physicians subjectively complain of stress related to changes in work shifts. Several potential biomarkers of stress have been described, but never investigated in emergency physician, who may represent a good model of stress due to the complex interplay between stress (life-and-death emergencies, which is the defining characteristic of their job), lack of sleep and fatigue due to repeated changes in shifts.The aim of this study was to compare biomarkers in emergency physicians working a 24-hour shift (24hS) or a 14-hour night shift (14hS), and in those working a control day (clerical work on return from leave). We also followed these markers three days following each shift (D3/24hS and D3/14hS).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nemergency physician\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",
