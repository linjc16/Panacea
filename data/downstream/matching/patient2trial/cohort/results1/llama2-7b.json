However, the patient's baseline serum creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, which is slightly higher than the 2 mg/dL threshold for pre-existing kidney impairment. This may be a concern, as the trial excludes patients with pre-existing acute kidney failure (greater than 50% decline in creatinine clearance).\n\nTherefore, while the patient may be eligible for the trial as a child, we would need to further investigate their kidney function and creatinine clearance to determine their eligibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the patient is not eligible for the clinical trial as an adult, but may be eligible upon further investigation as a child.</s>",
