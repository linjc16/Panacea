However, the criteria for pain assessment are not explicitly stated in the patient's note, so I will consider this criteria as unknown for the time being. It's important to note that the patient was experiencing ongoing pain at the time of her ER visit, which may indicate that she has experienced acute ischemic symptoms within the appropriate timeframe for the study. Similarly, it's unclear whether the patient had a myocardial infarction within the last 24 hours, making it difficult to determine whether she meets the third inclusion criteria.\n\nOverall, I would consider referring this patient for the study pending further investigation into her pain assessment and diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

Once we have all the necessary diagnostic information, we can then make a more definitive determination of the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial.\n\nAt this point, let's label the eligibility as 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.

Therefore, she meets the first inclusion criterion.\n\nTo determine if she meets the second inclusion criterion, we need to understand the mechanism of action of selenium in AIT patients. Selenium is believed to suppress autoimmune destruction of thyrocytes and decreases titers of serum TPOAb in AIT patients. The efficacy of a daily dose of 200micg of selenium has been proven in older clinical trials. The current study aims to estimate the optimal dose of selenium and understand its mechanism of action. The authors believe that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX and saves thyrocytes against oxidative stresses. However, they also want to test whether a lower dose of 100micg/d can suppress TPOAb levels in Se-non-deficient AIT patients. If it cannot, the mechanism of action may require more than just repletion of deficient stores of GPX. \n\nIn the patient's case, the current study seems to offer a new potential treatment option for her.

Excess weight gain puts mothers at risk for health problems such as diabetes and developing or sustaining obesity after pregnancy, and puts their babies at risk of being born too large or developing related health problems. Mothers will be randomized to a structured high dairy protein diet and walking program or the usual care by their care provider. The investigators research questions are: Will a structured nutrition and exercise program in pregnancy compared to usual prenatal care increase the chance that mothers will achieve pregnancy weight gain within the current recommendations; improve health measures, in mother and infant at six months post-partum; to evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in pregnancy on maintenance of bone status in the mother and bone health outcomes in the child in early life (6 months); and to investigate the interactions between genes associated with bone health and high dairy diet supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy, and bone health in mothers post-delivery and children to 6 months of age. Mothers' weight, physical activity and adherence to the nutrition plan will be assessed until birth and at follow-up with their infants at 6 months after birth. The research team will ensure new information is quickly transferred to programs to assist women to have healthier pregnancies.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nHealthy pregnant females > 18 years of age with singleton pregnancies (either nulliparous or multiparous);\nless than 17 weeks gestation;\na pre pregnancy B",

She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficulty swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n\nClinical Trial: Title: Human Movement Database\nSummary: This study will collect information on the different ways people control limb and body movements. This information will be used to develop a database on normal movements and adaptive movements of people who have diseases that affect the way they move. The database will serve as a tool to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with movement-related problems. Volunteers of all ages who have normal movement patterns or who have developed different ways to perform movement tasks may be eligible for this study. A physician or physical therapist will screen candidates to determine their strength, flexibility and range of motion of joints. Participants will be asked to perform movements such as walking, walking up or down stairs, standing quietly or reaching for an object or using treadmill. For the test, the arms and legs are wrapped with a soft, rubber-like material to which small plastic reflective balls are attached. A piece of firm material called a shell may be attached to the rubber sleeves or other areas of the body. Then the volunteer performs the specified task several times while special cameras record the movement. These cameras will record the positions of the reflective balls during movement and may show the person's face or body. Electrical activity in the muscles also may be measured, using small metal electrodes attached to the surface of the skin with an adhesive bandage.\n\nInclusion criteria: Any volunteer of any age from birth to old age who is deemed medically fit to participate and is willing to provide their informed consent will be included in the study.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial, as the study's focus on movement patterns may provide useful insights into the patient's hydrophobia and difficulty swallowing, which could help",

The patient's medical history raises some concerns.

Additionally, she was prescribed NSAIDs and a topical muscle relaxant for her symptoms. Based on this, I would need further investigation before deciding whether to refer her to the clinical trial (score of 1).\n\n3. The patient's symptoms progressed rapidly and required hospitalization due to spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficulty swallowing, and marked hydrophobia. These symptoms could potentially indicate a viral infection, such as rabies. However, the patient traveled to California three weeks prior to the onset of symptoms, which falls within the incubation period for rabies (typically around 2 weeks to several months). Therefore, it is unclear whether the patient has been exposed to rabies, and further testing would be needed to confirm this. If the patient is not diagnosed with rabies, I would still consider referring her to the clinical trial (score of 1).\n\n4. Another aspect to consider is the infection prevention measures the patient took during her trip to California. Did she wear protective clothing, such as gloves and masks, when handling stray animals? Was she vaccinated against rabies before her trip? This information would help determine whether the patient was at high risk of rabies exposure and whether the clinical trial would be appropriate for her.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would need further investigation to determine whether the patient's history of potentially viral symptoms is related to rabies exposure during her trip to California.

Additionally, there is no mention of a sustained improvement in renal function after a period of albumin therapy. \n\nI would therefore assess the patient's trial-level eligibility as a \"1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation\" given the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, as I would need further testing to confirm the presence of hepatorenal syndrome type 1. If it is confirmed that the patient meets all the necessary criteria for hepatorenal syndrome type 1, I would reassess the patient's eligibility as a \"2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.\" \n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",

However, there is no information provided regarding the patient's renal function history, and the study aims to investigate renal function decrease after non-cardiac surgery in chronic renal disease patients. Therefore, it is unclear whether the patient has chronic renal disease, and it's hard to determine if he meets the inclusion criteria based on this aspect. I'll assume for now that we don't have enough information to determine the patient's eligibility based on chronic renal disease.\n4.

Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial;\n2. Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation (until we have more information about his renal function history);\n3. Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial (if we confirm that he meets the inclusion criteria based on chronic renal disease).\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",

Treatment: The clinical trial mentions that neonates receiving aminophylline for AKI treatment as per local standard of care are eligible for the study. The patient is undergoing major surgery, and his low urine output suggests he is being treated for AKI. The initial urinalysis revealed granular casts per HPF, which may indicate glomerulonephritis or renal tubular epithelial injury, both of which can lead to AKI. The patient's AKI treatment may involve the use of aminophylline, making him potentially eligible for the trial.

The specific aims are: 1) define the physiologic effects of chemoradiotherapy with IMRT to various sites in the upper aerodigestive/vocal tract including the cervical esophagus and the rate at which patients return to oral intake; 2) document the acute toxicities, late complications, locoregional failure and survival, and the relationship between fibrosis rating and the measure of laryngeal elevation; 3) determine whether the patient\u2019s swallowing mechanism can compensate for physiologic deficits in swallowing by introduction of interventions (postural changes, voluntary swallow maneuvers, several bolus volumes); 4) determine whether time to return to oral intake, effects of swallow maneuvers and/or volume, presence of an esophageal stricture and the duration of success of dilatation depends on radiation dose volume to specific structures in the head and neck; 5) define the relationship of tongue base pressure to development of esophageal stricture. Patients will be accrued from Northwestern University and University of Chicago. Effects are defined in terms of swallowing function, morbidity, toxicity and survival.

The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of advanced, nonresectable, and/or metastatic non-hematologic malignancy which has shown to be progressive in the past 6 months. As he has a history of heavy smoking and drinking, there is no indication of serious concomitant non-oncological diseases or illnesses. However, he has active dysphagia which started several months ago, and the dysphagia is progressive and affects various foods, including solid, soft, and liquid. The patient's difficulty with swallowing points to esophageal cancer, which aligns with the inclusion criteria for patients with oesophageal carcinoma. Based on this, I see no clear signals that indicate the existence of a serious concomitant non-oncological disease/illness. There is no clear evidence of active, symptomatic brain metastases. The patient has not been previously diagnosed with a second malignancy. Based on these criteria, the patient does not meet the first exclusion criterion. Unfortunately, I am unsure if the patient has had any other malignancies or secondary cancers in the past because the provided patient note did not offer that information. However, this could potentially qualify as an exclusion criterion, so I suggest gathering additional information from the patient's clinic or other medical records. The patient has not received any cytotoxic anti-cancer-therapies or investigational drugs within the past four weeks. There is no evidence of breastfeeding, although this does not fully exclude the possibility of pregnancy. Women and men who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception are excluded from the study.

AbStats calculates intestinal rates by using two small sensors placed on a patient's abdomen to measure and analyze their abdominal sounds. Patients will be asked to wear a sensor every morning for 20 minutes while they are fasting daily during their inpatient visit. The sensor will measure the sounds within their abdomen. This data will be interpreted by the AbStats device, which will provide an intestinal rate measurement based on the sounds recorded by the sensors. This intestinal rate will be provided to the patient's treating physician together with other vital signs. The doctor, at his/her discretion, may choose to use this information to make decisions about the patient's feeding status.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\nAwake and alert\nNot on a regular diet\nNo mild to moderate acute pancreatitis\nNo massively GI hemorrhage\nNo impending or",

Nonetheless, there is no information regarding the reactivity of the pupils after the injury.

The patient meets one of the listed conditions, so further assessment is necessary.\n\nStep 3: Check if the patient is being admitted to resuscitation within 48 hours of the aggression\n\nThe patient's note does not explicitly state the time of the fall, but it does say that the child became drowsy, pale, and vomited half an hour after the fall. It's unclear whether this happened exactly 30 minutes after the head injury, so it's harder to determine whether the patient is being admitted to resuscitation within 48 hours of the aggression. To be conservative, we can assume the patient did not meet this requirement.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe patient does not meet the age requirement and did not present with the required neurological condition and time constraint. Therefore, the patient is not eligible for the clinical trial with a trial-level eligibility score of 0.</s>",

In order to accurately interpret the patient's eligibility, further evaluation would be necessary to confirm a Parkinson's disease diagnosis.\n4. Modified Hoehn & Yahr stages: The note mentions that the patient has dozens of small colonic polyps within rectosigmoid, but there is no information about the patient's motor symptoms. Without this information, it is impossible to determine the patient's Modified Hoehn & Yahr stages.\n5. Prior treatment with dopamine agonist: The note mentions that the patient's brother and sister received total proctocolectomy due to colonic adenomas, but there is no information about their previous medications, including dopamine agonists. More details would be required to assess this criterion.\n6. Informed consent: The patient is capable of giving written informed consent, according to the note.\n\nBased on the above assessment, I would consider referring this patient to the clinical trial upon further investigation to confirm the Parkinson's diagnosis and gather more information about prior dopamine agonist treatment. The patient's age, gender, and informed consent meet the inclusion criteria, but further evaluation is needed to fully determine eligibility.\n\nTherefore, my assessment of eligibility for this patient is: \"Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.\"\n\nTrial-level eligibility: \"Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.\"</s>",

Intermittent Claudication: The patient complains of increasing calf pain when walking uphill, which is a symptom of intermittent claudication.

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): The patient had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction two years ago and a transient ischemic attack six months ago, both of which suggest a likely diagnosis of PAD.

These symptoms and tests suggest the presence of acute heart failure.\n\n3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): The patient's LVEF is not mentioned in the patient note, but it is required to have a recent (< or = 1 month) echo or MUGA with LVEF > or = 40%.

This inclusion criterion is therefore met.\n\n6. BNP Level: The patient's BNP level is not mentioned in the patient note. Again, without this information, we cannot assess this criterion.\n\n7.

The patient's D-dimer level is elevated, which is a biomarker commonly associated with pulmonary embolism.\n5. Although the patient has been bedridden for two weeks, this would not exclude her from eligibility as the IPER study does not stipulate any restrictions on bed confinement.\n\nOverall, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and recent diagnosis, I would highly consider referring her to the IPER clinical trial to contribute to the education, improvement in knowledge, and scientific objectives of the study.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",
