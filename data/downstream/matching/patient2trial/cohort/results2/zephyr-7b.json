The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.~Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before the proceeding of health check.\n\nMeasurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a regular health check program.

Oxytocin is the most commonly used uterotonic drug to prevent and treat PPH in North America. However oxytocin has a very short duration of action, requiring a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. Moreover large doses are associated with adverse effects like hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias and ST changes. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) has recommended a single dose of 100 mcg of carbetocin at elective cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction. In three studies recently performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, the investigators have found no difference in uterine contractility between the doses of 20- 120 mcg carbetocin and that the ED90 is 14.8 mcg. Thus a larger trial comparing the minimum effective dose determined in the previous three trials with the standard 100 mcg dose is necessary to confirm these findings.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.\n- Written informed consent to participate in this study.\n- Term pregnancy\n\nAssessment of Eligibility: Based on the given patient note and inclusion criteria provided, the assessment of eligibility for this clinical trial is:\n\n- She is undergoing an elective cesarean delivery (Eligible).\n- There is no information about whether she has provided informed consent or not, so we cannot make an",

The patient's family background further suggests that the patient has a caregiver as required by another inclusion criterion, \"availability of a primary caregiver caring for the patient at least once a week.\" Thus, this criterion seems to be met.\n\n4. The patient's ability to walk is not explicitly stated, but the absence of any information to the contrary, coupled with the fact that there is no mention of immobility or bed-riddenness, suggests that the patient is still able to walk independently, as required by another inclusion criterion, \"ability to walk 15 meters independently (use of a walking aid is permitted).\"\n\n5. Based on routine geriatric assessment, the patient's life expectancy is expected to be over six months. Since this criterion, \"life expectancy of more than 6 months, as judged by their geriatrician,\" is not contested by any information given, I assume that it is also met.\n\nIn summary, this patient seems to meet all the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, \"Trial to Reduce Falls Incidence Rate in Frail Elderly,\" and I would assess the eligibility as:\"\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nAn 85-year-old man is brought to the ER because of gradual decrease in his level of consciousness. In the last 3 days he stopped walking and eating by himself. He has had no fever, cough, rash or diarrhea.

However, we are instructed to follow the patients who have been prescribed either Rivaroxaban or standard of care since the drug's market authorization until December 31, 2017. Since we do not have information on whether the patient received Rivaroxaban or standard of care during this time period, I would assess the eligibility as:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.\n\nFurther investigation would require confirmation whether the patient was prescribed Rivaroxaban or standard of care between market authorization and December 31, 2017.

She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficultly swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Clinical Trial Characterizing the Bioavailability of 1-Octanol in Adults With Ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor\n\n\nSummary: OVERVIEW~Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder affecting 0.4% of the general population and up to 14% of people 65 years and older. Response to medications such as beta blockers and primidone may be of benefit, but are often accompanied by intolerable side effects. Response to ethanol, on the other hand, has a roughly 80% chance of significant tremor reduction, though daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious medical, social, and legal consequences.~The leading hypothesis for ET pathophysiology is an unmasking of spontaneous oscillations originating in neurons of the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of ET; however, 1-octanol does this at a dose much lower than that leading to intoxication, suggesting in may be useful in the treatment of essential tremor. Our initial studies with 1-octanol have shown it to be safe at dosages up to 64mg/kg without signs of intoxication, while at the same time showing benefit.~OBJECTIVE~We plan to evaluate the efficacy of different 1-octanol formulations in humans based on accelerometry and spirography. We will also evaluate drug and metabolite bioavailabilities using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection method from plasma and urine samples.~STUDY POPULATION~We will study adult subjects with ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor (ET).~DESIGN~This study is designed as a two-phase unblinded inpatient study of adults with ET receiving weight-adjusted oral dosages of 2 different formulations of 1-octanol in a crossover fashion. Phase I of the study is designed to develop an octanol detection assay using HPLC. Four subjects will receive daily escalating dosages (1-32 mg/kg) of a single 1-octanol formulation followed by a crossover trial of both formulations at a dosage of 64 mg/kg. Phase II will study 20 subjects receiving one of the two formulations at 64 mg/kg on inpatient day 1 followed by a 24 hour period of close monitoring. The second formulation will be given on day 3 and the patient will again undergo close monitoring for 24 hours.~OUTCOME MEASURES~The primary outcome measures for the study will be efficacy based on tremor ratings from accelerometry and spirography. Secondary outcome measures will be the determination of bioavailability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of octanol #61864 and octanol #68751 and their metabolites.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nPatients with alcohol-responsive Essential Tremor\nLimb involvement should be a prominent feature of the Essential tremor\nPatients must be willing and able to safely stop and remain off any medications used to treat essential tremor for at least 4 half-lives\nPatients must be willing to abstain from ethanol and caffeine intake for at least 48 hours prior to starting the study hospitalization until study termination\nPatients must be willing and able to fast for periods of up to 12 hours during the study\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nPatients with abnormalities other than tremor on neurological exam\nPatients with active or past alcohol abuse or dependence\nPatients with acute or chronic severe medical conditions such as renal failure, hepatic failure or lung disease\nPatients taking primidone\nPatients on other acute or chronic medications that influence hepatic metabolism or central nervous system (CNS) function and cannot be temporarily discontinued for the length of the study\nPatients who do not wish to take a potentially intoxicating drug\nPatients with abnormalities on their baseline screening laboratory tests\nWomen who are pregnant or lactating\nPatients younger than age 21\nThe presence of cognitive impairment preventing informed consent or cooperation during the study\nPeople of Far East Asian or Native American descent, who may possess variant alleles of the genes for alcohol metabolism, i.e., alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in altered (slower) metabolism and potentially increased sensitivity to alcohols and their metabolites\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Small electrical impulses are used to excite/stimulate the nerves that supply paralyzed muscles. This activates those muscles, enabling them to produce basic but useful movement. Self-adhesive patches (electrodes) are placed on the skin close to the nerve that supplies the muscle and are connected by wires to a stimulator that produces the impulses. In this way, FES is used to correct the muscle weakness that is caused by injury to the brain or spinal cord.~Repetitive task practice is an activity-based therapy program that has been shown to enhance the recovery of hand and arm functions after stroke. This therapy consists of a set of training activities that are designed by a qualified therapist specific to your functional abilities that are to be performed with the impaired hand. These activities are designed to stimulate functional improvement with repetitive practice.~Spasticity is a nervous system disorder where certain muscles are continuously contracted. Botox injections are commonly used to help to reduce spasticity in areas of the body with increased muscle tone. This research is designed to look at any additional benefit that may occur when Botox injections are combined with specific occupational therapy exercises and with a device that uses functional electrical stimulation (FES) to help improve muscle function after stroke.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMinimum 6 months post injury/insult with unilateral upper limb spasticity of the elbow, wrist and/or finger flexors.\nPreinjection Modified Ashworth scores > 2 in at least one of the following areas: elbow, wrist, or finger flexors.\nSubjects must meet criteria for CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 2 and be able to complete Task 3 (thumb to index finger) of the CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 3, or demonstrate 50% gross grasp to be included.\nBotulinum toxin A (Botox\u00ae) stable patients (have received at least two prior doses of the agent with first dose occurring at least 6 months prior to study enrollment).\nAble to answer reliably to yes/no questions.\nAble to follow reliably 1-step instructions.\nWritten informed consent.\nFemales enrolled in this study who are of childbearing age will be required to use adequate measures of birth control for the entire study period.

She has suffered an injury/insult six months prior to the current observation, which resulted in unilateral upper limb spasticity affecting elbow, wrist, and finger flexors. Her Modified Ashworth scores are greater than 2 in at least one of these areas, indicating the presence of upper extremity spasticity. Additionally, the patient meets the criteria for CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 2 and can complete Task 3 (thumb to index finger) of the CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 3. These criteria signify that the patient has significant impairment in hand function and would potentially benefit from the intervention being studied. Furthermore, the patient has received botulinum toxin A (Botox\u00ae) injections previously, is stable with this therapy, and is able to answer reliably to yes/no questions and follow one-step instructions.\n\nLastly, the only potential barricade to the patient's eligibility would be the patient's gender and age. She is a female of childbearing age, and hence, she would be required to use adequate measures of birth control for the entire study period. However, as the patient has agreed to follow this requirement, she remains eligible for the trial.\n\nTo sum up, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the assessment of eligibility for this clinical trial is 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \n\nIn other words, this patient meets all the inclusion criteria, and therefore, she would be a good candidate to participate in the clinical trial.</s>",

Additionally, the patient has already undergone surgery to drain a liver abscess, which may also impact their eligibility for this study.

This inclusion criterion is met.\n\nRegarding the exclusion criteria, it is essential to check if the patient has any exclusion factors. Since no information regarding exclusion criteria is provided, we will assume that the patient does not have any exclusion factors and proceed with our assessment based only on the inclusion criteria.\n\nAs the patient has sustained multiple injuries, including liver injuries, she is a trauma patient, which may affect her liver's function. Inflammation, infection, or sepsis are also common in trauma patients, and it is possible that she will be subjected to other surgical procedures besides liver transplantation. Given this, her current liver status is compromised, making it less than ideal for donation. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to refer this patient for this clinical trial, and the eligibility score would be 0: \"Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.\"\n\nIn summary, although the patient is an adult, she does not meet the first inclusion criterion, and the current status of her liver makes her an unsuitable candidate for liver donation.

Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial:\n\n- Altitude effects: The patient's symptoms of a tender abdomen with guarding and rebound in all four quadrants, and possible internal injuries, may be affected by altitude exposure, as they suggest a compromised respiratory system. This aligns with the research hypothesis that exposure to 8,000 feet could cause hypoxia sufficient to adversely affect the comfort and well being of some commercial aircraft passengers on prolonged flights.\n\n- Exercise and altitude effects: The patient's injuries and compromised respiratory system may also be affected by exercise at altitude, potentially exacerbating symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Again, this aligns with the research hypothesis that the combination of moderate exercise and exposure to altitude could cause hypoxia sufficiently severe to adversely affect the comfort and well being of some people and that the combined effect of exercise and altitude on comfort and well being is greater than the effect of exercise or altitude alone.\n\nGiven these factors, I would highly likely refer this patient for this clinical trial, as the research hypotheses align with her potential symptoms and medical history.
