The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women\n\n\nSummary: Background:~- At present, women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer. However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all women.~Objectives:~- To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African American women.~Eligibility:~- African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.~Design:~Participants will be screened with personal health questions.~Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a questionnaire about their medical history.~The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center for study.~After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy report for any breast biopsies they have had.~There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous year.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAny woman who identifies as African American, Black, or African\nCurrently nursing a baby\nAble and willing to sign written informed consent\nWilling to be contacted by study personnel for follow-up to determine whether a biopsy took place\nWilling to have her milk sample archived for future analyses\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nThe woman does not consider herself to be of African American, Black, or African. These women may participate in the other ongoing Breast Milk Study at University of Massachusetts.\nUnable to sign written Informed Consent or Assent Form.\nUnwilling to be contacted by study personnel.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Recent information suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard. In fact at this time health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be associated with sustained weight loss over three (3) years. The results of the study may have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise and eating habits.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMen and women between 25 and 65 years of age.\nOverweight or Class I or Class II BMI.\nWalk without assistance.\nCommit to a schedule of assessment visits\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of delirium. However, standard EEG recording with 25 electrodes is labor intensive. We have previously showed that a brief EEG registration with three electrodes and automatic processing can distinguish patients with delirium from patients without delirium very well. However, these findings need to be validated in an unselected population.~The primary objective of this validation study is to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the EEG-based delirium monitor (including three electrodes and a reference electrode) compared to delirium quantification in frail elderly patients after surgery.~In an international multicenter study, 154 frail elderly patients will be included who will undergo elective surgery and are expected to remain admitted for at least two postoperative days. Patients are excluded if communication is not possible or admitted for neurological surgery.~A five minute EEG registration with the delirium monitor with four electrodes will be performed prior surgery and three consecutive days after surgery or until discharge. Within one hour of the EEG recording, the delirium assessment will be performed and recorded on video, which will be evaluated by delirium experts. The relative delta power (calculated from one minute of artifact-free EEG segment) will be compared with the conclusion of the delirium experts.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n60 years and older\nFrail\nUndergoing elective surgery\nExpected to remain admitted for at least 2 postoperative days\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 28-year-old female with neck and shoulder pain and left hand and arm paresthesias three weeks after returning from a trip to California where she attended a stray animal recovery campaign. Her physical exam was unremarkable except for slight tremors and almost imperceptible spasticity. She was prescribed NSAIDS and a topical muscle relaxant. She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficultly swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Safety and Efficacy Study of a Vaccine Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC) to Prevent Moderate to Severe Diarrhea\n\n\nSummary: This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) vaccine called ACE527. ACE527 is a vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from a germ called enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). This germ causes diarrhea, largely in children living in developing countries and in travelers to those countries. One purpose of this study is to see if the vaccine is safe and develops an immune response. Another purpose is to see if it prevents people from getting sick when exposed to the ETEC germ. This ETEC germ is also experimental (investigational).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria:\nMale or female age \u226518 and \u2264 50 years.\nGeneral good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of PI.\nNegative serum pregnancy test before first (visit V0) and before challenge (visit C0) for female subjects of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal or barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female subjects unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must have negative pregnancy tests.\nWillingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent obtained.\nCompletion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol procedures, knowledge of ETEC-associated illness, and by passing a written examination.\nAvailability for the study duration, including all planned follow-up visits.\nExclusion criteria:\nPresence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator precludes participation in the study. Some medical conditions which are adequately treated and stable would not preclude entry into the study. These conditions might include stable asthma controlled with inhalers or mild hypertension stably controlled with a single agent.\nSignificant abnormalities in screening hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis as determined by PI or PI in consultation with the MM and sponsor.\nPresence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody.\nEvidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA < 7 mg/dl or limit of detection of assay).\nEvidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence.\nEvidence of impaired immune function.\nBMI <19, >34\nRecent vaccination or receipt of an investigational product (within 30 days before vaccination).\nIntention to donate blood or blood products for one month following the completion of study participation (note: The Red Cross will not allow blood donations for 1 year following participation in an investigational research study).\nAny other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the ability of the subject to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results of the study\nWorking as a food handler, in child-care or as a healthcare worker with direct patient contact.\nHave household contacts who are <2 years old or >80 years old or infirm or immunocompromised (for reasons including corticosteroid therapy, HIV infection, cancer chemotherapy, or other chronic debilitating disease).\nAbnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).\nRegular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity.\nUse of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and others) within 30 days preceding the first vaccination or planned use during the active study period.\nKnown allergy to two of the following antibiotics: quinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and penicillin.\nSymptoms consistent with Traveler's Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries where ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.\nVaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin within 3 years prior to dosing.\nUse of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or antacids within 48 hours prior to dosing.\nHistory of diarrhea in the 7 days prior to vaccination (outpatient diarrhea is defined as \u2265 3 unformed loose stools in 24 hours).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 48-year-old white male with history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with acute abdominal pain, fever, dehydration, HR of 132 bpm, BP 80/40. The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness and positive Murphy sign. Abdominal ultrasound shows hepatomegaly and abundant free intraperitoneal fluid. Exploratory laparotomy reveals a ruptured liver abscess, which is then surgically drained. After surgery, the patient is taken to the ICU.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Efficacy and Safety of Primovist in Chinese Patients\n\n\nSummary: Participants who had been diagnosed or suspected by doctors to have focal liver lesions that need further evaluation in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Participants would need to have an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan so that doctors could have further information about the number and characteristics of the focal liver lesions.~Participants were invited to take part in this clinical study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Primovist, which is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium, on the efficacy of lesion detection and characterization, and tolerability in Chinese patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions.~Primovist, the investigational drug in this study, is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium developed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Its active substance is Gd-EOB-DTPA. Primovist was first approved in 2004 in Sweden followed by an approval in the European community, in Switzerland and Australia in the same year.~Procedures:~Before entry into the study and after entry of the study a physical examination was conducted, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, blood and urine samples were taken. Current medications and medical conditions (including suspected pregnancy) and medical and surgical history were elicited by doctors.~After entry into the study, participants were scheduled to have an MRI examination, which lasted about 25-35 minutes.~During the MRI examination, an initial MRI scan without contrast was acquired which followed by another MRI series after the intravenous administration of Primovist.~The following day participants were asked to return to the hospital for a follow-up safety evaluation.~Possible Benefit Participants were scheduled to receive an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan. Clinical studies indicated that Primovist increased the efficacy of detection and characterization of focal liver lesions by providing better contrast between the focal liver lesions and surrounding normal tissue. Primovist were shown to provide additional information regarding existence, number and characterization (lesion or non-lesion, malignant or benign) of these abnormalities.~Based on the experience with patients given Primovist, some adverse reactions were observed.~Most of undesirable effects were transient and of mild to moderate intensity. The most commonly noted adverse events (AEs) in subjects receiving Primovist for MRI were nausea and headache with an incidence of 1.1%. Other AEs that occurred in 0.5% of the subject population were feeling hot (0.8%), back pain (0.6%) and dizziness (0.5%).~All other AEs occurred in less than 0.5% of the patients, e.g. anxiety; coughing; eye disorder; fever; flatulence; generalized spasm; hypertension; injection site symptoms including edema, inflammation, and reaction; lightheadedness; parosmia; postural hypotension; taste perversion, motoric unrest; acute respiratory distress; fatigue; malaise; vomiting; palpitations, erythema, chest pain and back pain.~Coldness, warmth or pain at the injection site, injection site reaction, and injection site accumulation of fluid were rare. In very rare cases strong allergy-like reactions ranging to shock may occur.~Post-marketing tachycardia and restlessness have been reported. As in the case of other investigational drugs, there may also be unforeseen side effects.~Additional information concerning all Gadolinium- based contrast agents Primovist contains the rare earth metal gadolinium as active ingredient. There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents (especially Omniscan) in patients with severe renal impairment. NSF is a systemic disease characterised by formation of connective tissue in the skin, which becomes thickened and hard, sometimes leading to contractures and joint immobility. The clinical course is usually progressive and currently no treatment is available. To date NSF has only been reported in association with some Gd-containing contrast agents, but the role of these contrast agents in the overall pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely understood.~No reports of patients with NSF after administration of Primovist\u00ae are known. The risk to trigger NSF in risk patients with severe renal impairment is considered to be low for Primovist\u00ae due to the low dose given and the additional excretion via feces. Furthermore the participation of patients with severe renal impairment are excluded from this study.~In case the participants were suffering from renal insufficiency, they were told to tell their doctors prior to application of the contrast agent. In case the participants experienced any new alterations of the skin following the administration of the contrast agent, they were told to contact their doctors as soon as possible after they had recognized these symptoms.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.\nPatients (men or women) with at least one focal liver lesion, either identified or suspected by ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT)/spiral-CT, conventional angiography, CT-angiography (CTA), CT-arterioportography (CTAP) or unenhanced / contrast-enhanced MRI* within 2 months before entering the study\nFor reference, the following pathologies will meet the definition of 'focal liver lesions':\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nCholangiole carcinoma\nMetastasis\nFocal lymphoma\nAdenoma\nFocal nodular hyperplasia\nHemangioma\nAbscess\nFocal liver fibrosis\nRegenerative nodules\nFocal fatty infiltration\nHydatid cyst\nLiver cyst\nFocal sparing in fatty liver\nOthers\nPatients willing to undergo study procedures including safety follow-up\nPatients who have undergone or who are scheduled to undergo the defined procedure for SOR within one month before or after the study MRI\nWomen of child-bearing potential with negative urine pregnancy test result within 24 hours before contrast medium (CM) injection\nPatients who are fully informed about the study and have signed the informed consent form\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 48-year-old white male with history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with acute abdominal pain, fever, dehydration, HR of 132 bpm, BP 80/40. The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness and positive Murphy sign. Abdominal ultrasound shows hepatomegaly and abundant free intraperitoneal fluid. Exploratory laparotomy reveals a ruptured liver abscess, which is then surgically drained. After surgery, the patient is taken to the ICU.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Study of Effectiveness and Safety of Azithromycin-based Extended-spectrum Prophylaxis to Prevent Post Cesarean Infection\n\n\nSummary: The Cesarean Section Optimal Antibiotic Prophylaxis (C/SOAP) study is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of azithromycin-based extended-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis (azithromycin plus standard narrow-spectrum cephalosporin) relative to standard single-agent cephalosporin (preferably prior to surgical incision) to prevent post-cesarean infection.~Hypothesis: Compared to narrow-spectrum prophylaxis (i.e. cefazolin alone, or clindamycin if cephalosporin allergy) prior to surgical incision, the addition of extended-spectrum prophylaxis (azithromycin + cefazolin) reduces the incidence of post-cesarean infection.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n-\nPregnant Women aged 14 years and over at \u2265 24 weeks' viable gestation who will undergo unscheduled/non-elective cesareans with either:\nLabor (spontaneous or induced): active labor (ongoing contractions and at least 4cm dilated or contractions for at least 4 hours with documented cervical change of \u22651cm dilatation or \u226550% effacement), or\nMembrane rupture (standardized to duration of at least 4 hours prior to randomization).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient is a 52-year-old African American man with a history of heavy smoking and drinking. This matches the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, which is recruiting a convenience sample of 50 volunteers (25 current smokers with at least 5 years of smoking history, 25 never smokers). The patient is a current smoker with at least 5 years of smoking history, which meets the inclusion criteria.\n\n2. The patient has progressive dysphagia, which is not explicitly mentioned in the inclusion or exclusion criteria. However, the patient is able to locate the point where food is obstructated at the lower end of their sternum, suggesting they may have problems with swallowing due to esophageal dysfunction. This condition is not listed as an exclusion criterion, so it does not affect the patient's eligibility.\n\n3. The patient has lost 25 pounds, which is likely related to both their smoking and dysphagia. This information is also not listed as an inclusion or exclusion criterion, so it does not impact the patient's eligibility.\n\n4. The clinical trial includes a dental exam and collection of saliva and swab samples from various parts of the mouth and nose. None of these procedures are mentioned as exclusion criteria, and since the patient is a potential match for the study criteria, it is likely they would be willing to undergo these procedures and tests as part of the trial.\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient appears to be a good match for the clinical trial on Cigarette Smoking and Oral Microbiota.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation.</s>",
