        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women\n\n\nSummary: Background:~- At present, women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer. However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all women.~Objectives:~- To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African American women.~Eligibility:~- African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.~Design:~Participants will be screened with personal health questions.~Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a questionnaire about their medical history.~The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center for study.~After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy report for any breast biopsies they have had.~There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous year.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAny woman who identifies as African American, Black, or African\nCurrently nursing a baby\nAble and willing to sign written informed consent\nWilling to be contacted by study personnel for follow-up to determine whether a biopsy took place\nWilling to have her milk sample archived for future analyses\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nThe woman does not consider herself to be of African American, Black, or African. These women may participate in the other ongoing Breast Milk Study at University of Massachusetts.\nUnable to sign written Informed Consent or Assent Form.\nUnwilling to be contacted by study personnel.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Recent information suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard. In fact at this time health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be associated with sustained weight loss over three (3) years. The results of the study may have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise and eating habits.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMen and women between 25 and 65 years of age.\nOverweight or Class I or Class II BMI.\nWalk without assistance.\nCommit to a schedule of assessment visits\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",
