The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women\n\n\nSummary: Background:~- At present, women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer. However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all women.~Objectives:~- To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African American women.~Eligibility:~- African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.~Design:~Participants will be screened with personal health questions.~Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a questionnaire about their medical history.~The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center for study.~After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy report for any breast biopsies they have had.~There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous year.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAny woman who identifies as African American, Black, or African\nCurrently nursing a baby\nAble and willing to sign written informed consent\nWilling to be contacted by study personnel for follow-up to determine whether a biopsy took place\nWilling to have her milk sample archived for future analyses\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nThe woman does not consider herself to be of African American, Black, or African. These women may participate in the other ongoing Breast Milk Study at University of Massachusetts.\nUnable to sign written Informed Consent or Assent Form.\nUnwilling to be contacted by study personnel.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Recent information suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard. In fact at this time health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be associated with sustained weight loss over three (3) years. The results of the study may have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise and eating habits.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMen and women between 25 and 65 years of age.\nOverweight or Class I or Class II BMI.\nWalk without assistance.\nCommit to a schedule of assessment visits\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of delirium. However, standard EEG recording with 25 electrodes is labor intensive. We have previously showed that a brief EEG registration with three electrodes and automatic processing can distinguish patients with delirium from patients without delirium very well. However, these findings need to be validated in an unselected population.~The primary objective of this validation study is to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the EEG-based delirium monitor (including three electrodes and a reference electrode) compared to delirium quantification in frail elderly patients after surgery.~In an international multicenter study, 154 frail elderly patients will be included who will undergo elective surgery and are expected to remain admitted for at least two postoperative days. Patients are excluded if communication is not possible or admitted for neurological surgery.~A five minute EEG registration with the delirium monitor with four electrodes will be performed prior surgery and three consecutive days after surgery or until discharge. Within one hour of the EEG recording, the delirium assessment will be performed and recorded on video, which will be evaluated by delirium experts. The relative delta power (calculated from one minute of artifact-free EEG segment) will be compared with the conclusion of the delirium experts.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n60 years and older\nFrail\nUndergoing elective surgery\nExpected to remain admitted for at least 2 postoperative days\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 28-year-old female with neck and shoulder pain and left hand and arm paresthesias three weeks after returning from a trip to California where she attended a stray animal recovery campaign. Her physical exam was unremarkable except for slight tremors and almost imperceptible spasticity. She was prescribed NSAIDS and a topical muscle relaxant. She was brought in to the ER three days later with spastic arm movements, sweating, increasing agitation and anxiety, malaise, difficultly swallowing and marked hydrophobia, and was immediately hospitalized.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Safety and Efficacy Study of a Vaccine Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC) to Prevent Moderate to Severe Diarrhea\n\n\nSummary: This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) vaccine called ACE527. ACE527 is a vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from a germ called enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). This germ causes diarrhea, largely in children living in developing countries and in travelers to those countries. One purpose of this study is to see if the vaccine is safe and develops an immune response. Another purpose is to see if it prevents people from getting sick when exposed to the ETEC germ. This ETEC germ is also experimental (investigational).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria:\nMale or female age \u226518 and \u2264 50 years.\nGeneral good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of PI.\nNegative serum pregnancy test before first (visit V0) and before challenge (visit C0) for female subjects of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal or barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female subjects unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must have negative pregnancy tests.\nWillingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent obtained.\nCompletion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol procedures, knowledge of ETEC-associated illness, and by passing a written examination.\nAvailability for the study duration, including all planned follow-up visits.\nExclusion criteria:\nPresence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator precludes participation in the study. Some medical conditions which are adequately treated and stable would not preclude entry into the study. These conditions might include stable asthma controlled with inhalers or mild hypertension stably controlled with a single agent.\nSignificant abnormalities in screening hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis as determined by PI or PI in consultation with the MM and sponsor.\nPresence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody.\nEvidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA < 7 mg/dl or limit of detection of assay).\nEvidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence.\nEvidence of impaired immune function.\nBMI <19, >34\nRecent vaccination or receipt of an investigational product (within 30 days before vaccination).\nIntention to donate blood or blood products for one month following the completion of study participation (note: The Red Cross will not allow blood donations for 1 year following participation in an investigational research study).\nAny other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the ability of the subject to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results of the study\nWorking as a food handler, in child-care or as a healthcare worker with direct patient contact.\nHave household contacts who are <2 years old or >80 years old or infirm or immunocompromised (for reasons including corticosteroid therapy, HIV infection, cancer chemotherapy, or other chronic debilitating disease).\nAbnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).\nRegular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity.\nUse of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and others) within 30 days preceding the first vaccination or planned use during the active study period.\nKnown allergy to two of the following antibiotics: quinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and penicillin.\nSymptoms consistent with Traveler's Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries where ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.\nVaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin within 3 years prior to dosing.\nUse of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or antacids within 48 hours prior to dosing.\nHistory of diarrhea in the 7 days prior to vaccination (outpatient diarrhea is defined as \u2265 3 unformed loose stools in 24 hours).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 48-year-old white male with history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with acute abdominal pain, fever, dehydration, HR of 132 bpm, BP 80/40. The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness and positive Murphy sign. Abdominal ultrasound shows hepatomegaly and abundant free intraperitoneal fluid. Exploratory laparotomy reveals a ruptured liver abscess, which is then surgically drained. After surgery, the patient is taken to the ICU.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Efficacy and Safety of Primovist in Chinese Patients\n\n\nSummary: Participants who had been diagnosed or suspected by doctors to have focal liver lesions that need further evaluation in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Participants would need to have an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan so that doctors could have further information about the number and characteristics of the focal liver lesions.~Participants were invited to take part in this clinical study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Primovist, which is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium, on the efficacy of lesion detection and characterization, and tolerability in Chinese patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions.~Primovist, the investigational drug in this study, is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium developed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Its active substance is Gd-EOB-DTPA. Primovist was first approved in 2004 in Sweden followed by an approval in the European community, in Switzerland and Australia in the same year.~Procedures:~Before entry into the study and after entry of the study a physical examination was conducted, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, blood and urine samples were taken. Current medications and medical conditions (including suspected pregnancy) and medical and surgical history were elicited by doctors.~After entry into the study, participants were scheduled to have an MRI examination, which lasted about 25-35 minutes.~During the MRI examination, an initial MRI scan without contrast was acquired which followed by another MRI series after the intravenous administration of Primovist.~The following day participants were asked to return to the hospital for a follow-up safety evaluation.~Possible Benefit Participants were scheduled to receive an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan. Clinical studies indicated that Primovist increased the efficacy of detection and characterization of focal liver lesions by providing better contrast between the focal liver lesions and surrounding normal tissue. Primovist were shown to provide additional information regarding existence, number and characterization (lesion or non-lesion, malignant or benign) of these abnormalities.~Based on the experience with patients given Primovist, some adverse reactions were observed.~Most of undesirable effects were transient and of mild to moderate intensity. The most commonly noted adverse events (AEs) in subjects receiving Primovist for MRI were nausea and headache with an incidence of 1.1%. Other AEs that occurred in 0.5% of the subject population were feeling hot (0.8%), back pain (0.6%) and dizziness (0.5%).~All other AEs occurred in less than 0.5% of the patients, e.g. anxiety; coughing; eye disorder; fever; flatulence; generalized spasm; hypertension; injection site symptoms including edema, inflammation, and reaction; lightheadedness; parosmia; postural hypotension; taste perversion, motoric unrest; acute respiratory distress; fatigue; malaise; vomiting; palpitations, erythema, chest pain and back pain.~Coldness, warmth or pain at the injection site, injection site reaction, and injection site accumulation of fluid were rare. In very rare cases strong allergy-like reactions ranging to shock may occur.~Post-marketing tachycardia and restlessness have been reported. As in the case of other investigational drugs, there may also be unforeseen side effects.~Additional information concerning all Gadolinium- based contrast agents Primovist contains the rare earth metal gadolinium as active ingredient. There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents (especially Omniscan) in patients with severe renal impairment. NSF is a systemic disease characterised by formation of connective tissue in the skin, which becomes thickened and hard, sometimes leading to contractures and joint immobility. The clinical course is usually progressive and currently no treatment is available. To date NSF has only been reported in association with some Gd-containing contrast agents, but the role of these contrast agents in the overall pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely understood.~No reports of patients with NSF after administration of Primovist\u00ae are known. The risk to trigger NSF in risk patients with severe renal impairment is considered to be low for Primovist\u00ae due to the low dose given and the additional excretion via feces. Furthermore the participation of patients with severe renal impairment are excluded from this study.~In case the participants were suffering from renal insufficiency, they were told to tell their doctors prior to application of the contrast agent. In case the participants experienced any new alterations of the skin following the administration of the contrast agent, they were told to contact their doctors as soon as possible after they had recognized these symptoms.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.\nPatients (men or women) with at least one focal liver lesion, either identified or suspected by ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT)/spiral-CT, conventional angiography, CT-angiography (CTA), CT-arterioportography (CTAP) or unenhanced / contrast-enhanced MRI* within 2 months before entering the study\nFor reference, the following pathologies will meet the definition of 'focal liver lesions':\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nCholangiole carcinoma\nMetastasis\nFocal lymphoma\nAdenoma\nFocal nodular hyperplasia\nHemangioma\nAbscess\nFocal liver fibrosis\nRegenerative nodules\nFocal fatty infiltration\nHydatid cyst\nLiver cyst\nFocal sparing in fatty liver\nOthers\nPatients willing to undergo study procedures including safety follow-up\nPatients who have undergone or who are scheduled to undergo the defined procedure for SOR within one month before or after the study MRI\nWomen of child-bearing potential with negative urine pregnancy test result within 24 hours before contrast medium (CM) injection\nPatients who are fully informed about the study and have signed the informed consent form\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 48-year-old white male with history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with acute abdominal pain, fever, dehydration, HR of 132 bpm, BP 80/40. The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness and positive Murphy sign. Abdominal ultrasound shows hepatomegaly and abundant free intraperitoneal fluid. Exploratory laparotomy reveals a ruptured liver abscess, which is then surgically drained. After surgery, the patient is taken to the ICU.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Study of Effectiveness and Safety of Azithromycin-based Extended-spectrum Prophylaxis to Prevent Post Cesarean Infection\n\n\nSummary: The Cesarean Section Optimal Antibiotic Prophylaxis (C/SOAP) study is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of azithromycin-based extended-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis (azithromycin plus standard narrow-spectrum cephalosporin) relative to standard single-agent cephalosporin (preferably prior to surgical incision) to prevent post-cesarean infection.~Hypothesis: Compared to narrow-spectrum prophylaxis (i.e. cefazolin alone, or clindamycin if cephalosporin allergy) prior to surgical incision, the addition of extended-spectrum prophylaxis (azithromycin + cefazolin) reduces the incidence of post-cesarean infection.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n-\nPregnant Women aged 14 years and over at \u2265 24 weeks' viable gestation who will undergo unscheduled/non-elective cesareans with either:\nLabor (spontaneous or induced): active labor (ongoing contractions and at least 4cm dilated or contractions for at least 4 hours with documented cervical change of \u22651cm dilatation or \u226550% effacement), or\nMembrane rupture (standardized to duration of at least 4 hours prior to randomization).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nAn 8-year-old male presents in March to the ER with fever up to 39 C, dyspnea and cough for 2 days. He has just returned from a 5 day vacation in Colorado. Parents report that prior to the onset of fever and cough, he had loose stools. He denies upper respiratory tract symptoms. On examination he is in respiratory distress and has bronchial respiratory sounds on the left. A chest x-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Chest Ultrasound of ER Patients With Cough or SOB\n\n\nSummary: Acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) is a common complaint for patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). The chest radiograph (CXR) has been the mainstay in evaluating patients with shortness of breath and often provides the timely diagnosis of pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, among other primary diseases of the lung. There are limitations with chest radiograph such as large body mass (e.g, obesity) and patient positioning. On occasion, chest radiography findings are difficult to interpret. Lung ultrasonography may offer a means of clarifying ambiguous results.~The objective of this study to determine the usefulness of point of care lung ultrasound in evaluating patients presenting to the ED with shortness of breath, cough and/or wheezing.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPresenting to the Emergency Department with cough, wheezing and/or dyspnea (shortness of breath)\nReferred for CXR and/or CT scan\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Given this limited survival it is important to consider quality of life (QOL) when treating these patients. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) can increase survival to 6 month. However, WBRT itself has been shown to reduce QOL by increasing drowsiness, leg weakness and hair loss in patients with brain metastases. Both fatigue and hair loss were reported to have the largest decline in QOL scores when WBRT is used in the prophylactic setting in small cell lung cancer. Recent technological improvements in patient positioning and treatment planning will allow us to treat the whole brain with reduced margins, allowing better sparing of the scalp. In view of the large impact of hair loss on quality of life, the investigators hypothesize to see an improved quality of life with scalp sparing techniques.~Study hypothesis: Volumetric arc therapy results in a reduced hair loss and a subsequent clinically important improvement in QOL.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nBrain metastases\nAge \u2265 18 years.\nSigned informed consent\nRecursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) class III patients\nRecursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) class I-II patients and >3 brain metastases\nPatients with small cell lung cancer extended disease eligible for prophylactic Whole-Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 63-year-old man presents with cough and shortness of breath. His past medical history is notable for heavy smoking, spinal stenosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism and mild psoriasis. He also has a family history of early onset dementia. His symptoms began about a week prior to his admission, with productive cough, purulent sputum and difficulty breathing, requiring him to use his home oxygen for the past 24 hours. He denies fever. On examination he is cyanotic, tachypneic, with a barrel shaped chest and diffuse rales over his lungs. A chest x-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Acute Effect of Aclidinium on Hyperinflation and Ventilation Inhomogeneity in Severe COPD Patients\n\n\nSummary: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by lung hyperinflation and flow limitation. These physiopathological modifications are secondary to loss of elastic recoil and bronchial obstruction due to emphysema.~The cornerstone of COPD treatment is represented by inhaled beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics. The molecules of the latter classes can be characterized by short lasting action (few hours), long acting action (12 hours) or ultra long acting duration of action (24 hours).~For years the only anticholinergic (or antimuscarinic) drug other than those used by aerosol, was Tiotropium Bromide. Recently two new antimuscarinic agents have been launched on the market: glycopyrronium bromide (once daily) and aclidinium (twice daily).~The Single Breath Nitrogen Test is capable of identifying the pulmonary closing volume. The part of the curve that reflects lung ventilation inhomogeneity is the slope of phase III~For COPD patients, the most important characteristic for an inhalatory drug is a prompt action in order to give a quick relief from respiratory symptoms, in particular dyspnoea.~The objective of this study is to study the acute action of glycopyrronium and aclidinium in terms of reduction of hyperinflation, pulmonary specific resistances, lung volume distribution and dyspnoea at rest in severe COPD patients.~To our knowledge no study has explored these aspects before.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nSignature of informed consent\nCOPD patients with age raging from 50 to 85 years old\nPatients with at least a history of COPD of one year\nCOPD patients clinically stable in the last three months\nCOPD subjects with Forced Expiratory Volume at one second (FEV1)<50% of predicted value\nCOPD subjects with Residual Volume (RV) >125% predicted value\nFEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) <88% (males) or <89% (females) of Low Levels of Normality (LLN)\nCOPD former or active smokers with at least a smoking history of 20 pack year\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 63-year-old man presents with cough and shortness of breath. His past medical history is notable for heavy smoking, spinal stenosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism and mild psoriasis. He also has a family history of early onset dementia. His symptoms began about a week prior to his admission, with productive cough, purulent sputum and difficulty breathing, requiring him to use his home oxygen for the past 24 hours. He denies fever. On examination he is cyanotic, tachypneic, with a barrel shaped chest and diffuse rales over his lungs. A chest x-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: The Oral Microbiota as Reservoir for Systemic Opportunistic Pathogens\n\n\nSummary: Small pilot studies with approximately 20 people per group support that eradication of the oral flora causes fewer exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The biological underpinning put forward is that eradicating the oral microbiome will eliminate a source of re-infection as the concentration of antibiotics prescribed to treat COPD exacerbations are not able to inhibit the bacteria in the oral biofilms that require 250 times higher concentration.~The specific aim is to investigate if adding advanced dental cleaning to COPD treatment can (i) lower the number of exacerbations and (ii) improve the COPD symptoms the coming 12 months. In an effort to explain the underpinning mechanism we will collect oral dental biofilm samples at baseline and follow up in the treatment and control group to investigate changes in the composition of the biofilm.~The subjects are selected by experienced COPD nurses. Exclusion criteria are having metastatic cancer or dementia. The COPD clinic informs the dental personal about COPD parameters, including spirometry data. At the dental clinic the patient answers a questionnaire, including a COPD assessment test (CAT) which has been validated extensively. The patients undergo a dental examination and are then randomized to test or control group. The test group go through supra- and subgingival scaling and scraping of the tongue as well as chlorhexidine rinse. The control group attends all visits.~All subjects go through the intervention after 6 months and are followed up after 12 and 24 months using questionnaire, dental plaque sampling and spirometry. The COPD nurses reviewing their medical records assess number of exacerbations.~A confirmation of the study hypothesis will be important in lowering the number of exacerbations in COPD patients, causing less suffering, less costs and less usage of antibiotics. If dental treatment is beneficial for exacerbation frequency it could be argued that dental treatment should be subsidized in this patient category.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nCOPD arm - COPD Gold standard 1-4.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 51-year-old woman is seen in clinic for advice on osteoporosis. She has a past medical history of significant hypertension and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day. She was documented by previous LH and FSH levels to be in menopause within the last year. She is concerned about breaking her hip as she gets older and is seeking advice on osteoporosis prevention.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Osteoporosis Screening Trial\n\n\nSummary: Osteoporosis is the most common disease of bone and characterized firstly by low bone mass and secondly, impaired bone microarchitecture structure resulting in reduced strength and increased risk of fracture. Osteoporosis is divided into: primary (Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Osteoporosis & elderly and senile osteoporosis) and secondary. The most common form is postmenopausal osteoporosis. It occurs in women after menopause and is associated with decreased estrogen production, which normally occurs at this age women Osteoporosis usually occurs after age 50, it is very common in women than in men, and its frequency increases with advancing age.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nFemales\nPostmenopausal women\nOutpatients screened for osteoporosis\nWomen > 45 years\nWomen < 45 years under menopause\nWomen obtained their consent to be measured\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 56-year-old female on 20th day post-left mastectomy presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and malaise. The patient says that she has remained in bed for the last two weeks. The physical examination reveals tenderness on the left upper thoracic wall and right calf. The surgical incision shows no bleeding or signs of infection. Pulmonary auscultation is significant for bilateral decreased breath sounds, especially at the right base. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated D-dimer.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Sonography Outcomes Assessment Program for Lower Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis\n\n\nSummary: Currently, most emergency physicians have limited access to obtaining formal radiology ultrasound studies, particularly overnight. Many are forced to adopt risky and expensive strategies in managing their patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who present during off-hours: for low risk patients, discharging without anticoagulation and arranging for outpatient studies; for moderate to high risk patients, empirically anticoagulating and admitting to the hospital to await definitive testing. If emergency physicians could reliably perform an accurate ultrasound exam for DVT, such risks could be obviated.~This is a prospective, observational cohort study assessing the accuracy of emergency physician diagnosis of proximal DVT using compact ultrasound equipment and a simplified compression technique. The value of color flow doppler and augmentation will also be assessed. Outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio) will be assessed at 30 days.~Prior to enrolling patients in the study, emergency physicians will undertake a 2 hour training course on the performance of the simplified compression technique for the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT. Emergency physicians will perform the DVT ultrasound exam on study subjects with suspected DVT. Clinical management of the study subjects will not be altered; all subjects will proceed to receive a formal DVT ultrasound study by the radiology department which will serve as the criterion reference for the study.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nInclusion criteria:\nPresenting signs and symptoms sufficiently suspicious for lower extremity DVT to warrant a formal radiology study in the opinion of the treating physician AND EITHER 2a. Moderate or high pre-test clinical probability of DVT (Wells Criteria) OR 2b. Low pre-test clinical probability of DVT with a positive D-dimer\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

However, it is widely accepted that bacteria living in the large bowel are essential for the development of the disease. Intuitively, therefore, a logical approach to treatment would be to use antibiotics. However, antimicrobial chemotherapy has been unsuccessful in managing acute colitis, and has had only limited benefit in long-term treatment. The failure of antibiotics in UC arises from the fact that no-one has tried to identify which bacteria are involved in causing disease, and equally importantly, nobody has targeted appropriate antibiotics to knock out the specific bacteria in question, in a systematic way. Despite this, increasing evidence implicates bacteria living on the lining of the bowel being involved in UC. Our aim, therefore is to identify bacteria colonizing the mucosal surface in the lower large intestine and to determine the antibiotic sensitivities of those the investigators believe to be particularly involved in the disease, such as enterococcit, peptostreptococci and enterobacteria. Because the investigators have already studied resistance to antimicrobial in many mucosal isolate, the investigators plan ot focus on using a combination of two antibiotics in this work. A controlled trial will test the benefit of using these antibiotics over a period of one month and then the patients will be followed up over a six month period. The investigators will be looking for significant long-term improvements, and a reduction in drug use following antibiotic therapy.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nActive ulcerative colitis, CAI greater than or equal to 4\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\n64-year-old obese female with diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and persistently elevated HbA1c.

Dermagraft is a device containing live human fibroblasts grown on an absorbable Vicryl mesh. Patients are seen weekly until they heal or the 12-week treatment period is complete.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatient is 18 years of age or older.\nPatient has type I or II diabetes.\nFoot ulcer has been present for a minimum of 2 weeks under the current investigator's care.\nFoot ulcer is on the plantar surface of the forefoot or heel.\nUlcer size is >/=1.0 cm2 at Day 0 (day of randomization).\nUlcer extends through the dermis and into subcutaneous tissue but without exposure of muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule.\nUlcer is free of necrotic debris, exhibits no signs of clinical infection, and appears to be made up of healthy vascularized tissue.\nPatient's Ankle-Arm Index by Doppler is >/=0.7.\nPatient has adequate circulation to the foot as evidenced by a palpable pulse.\nFemale patients of child bearing potential must not be pregnant and must use accepted means of birth control.\nPatient and caregiver are willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply with the follow-up regimen.\nPatient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment.\nPatient's study ulcer has been present (open) for at least 6 weeks at the time of the Screening visit.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\n64-year-old obese female with diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and persistently elevated HbA1c. She is reluctant to see a nutritionist and is not compliant with her diabetes medication or exercise. She complains of a painful skin lesion on the left lower leg. She has tried using topical lotions and creams but the lesion has increased in size and is now oozing.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Comparison of Resin Salve and Octenidine in Patients With Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers\n\n\nSummary: Prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers are reported to be 15% in patients who suffer from diabetes and ulcerations are present in 84% of all diabetes-related amputations. Peripheral neuropathy leading to unperceived trauma seems to be the major cause of diabetic foot ulcers with 45-60% of ulcers to be considered merely neuropathic and 45% of mixed, neuropathic and ischemic etiology. Ulceration of lower limb is one of the most common complications related with diabetes and one of the major causes for hospitalization of diabetic patients. The most significant contributors to diabetic lower limb ulceration are neuropathy, deformity, uncontrolled elevated plantar pressure, poor glycemic status, peripheral vascular disease, male gender and duration of diabetes. Treatment of lower limb ulcers imposes an enormous burden on health care resources worldwide, and at least 33% of all expenses are spent to treat diabetic ulcers manifested as a complication of diabetes.~Although at least 170 topical wound care products are available, evidence of the superiority of one over another is tenuous, well-designed randomized, controlled trials are rare, and the number of case-control or observational studies is limited. In recent years, salve prepared from Norway spruce (Picea abies) resin has successfully been used in medical context to treat both acute and chronic wounds and ulcers of various origins. The objective of this prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial is to investigate healing rate and healing time of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer in patients, who are suffering from infected fore- or mid-foot ulceration (PEDIS-classification \u2265 Grade II; 19) originated from Type I or II diabetes, and in patients whose diabetic ulcerations are candidates for topical treatment with resin (Study treatment) or octenidine (Control treatment). In addition, factors contributing with delayed healing of ulceration, antimicrobial properties, safety and cost-effectiveness of the resin salve treatment and control treatment will be analyzed.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nan adult patient (18-80 years) suffering from infected neuropathic fore- or mid-foot ulceration originated from type I or II diabetes (PEDIS-classification \u2265 Grade II).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 26-year-old obese woman with a history of bipolar disorder complains that her recent struggles with her weight and eating have caused her to feel depressed. She states that she has recently had difficulty sleeping and feels excessively anxious and agitated. She also states that she has had thoughts of suicide.

Her current medications include lithium carbonate and zolpidem.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Lithium for Suicidal Behavior in Mood Disorders\n\n\nSummary: Observational evidence and findings from clinical trials conducted for other reasons suggest that lithium, a drug used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, and, to a lesser extent, depression, may reduce rates of suicides and suicide attempts. However, this hypothesis has not yet been adequately examined in a randomized clinical trial conducted specifically to test lithium's efficacy in preventing suicides. This clinical trial fills this gap.~This study is feasible within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) because it is a large, integrated health system with existing programs for identifying patients at risk for suicide and delivering enhanced services. In VA, approximately 12,000 patients with depression or bipolar disorder survive a suicide attempt or related behavior each year, and 15% of them repeat within one year. Experimental treatment in this study will supplement usual care for major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as VA's standard, enhanced management for patients at high risk.~The investigators will recruit 1862 study participants, from approximately 30 VA Hospitals. Participants will be patients with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent episode of suicidal self-directed violence or were hospitalized specifically to prevent suicide. Randomly, half will receive lithium, and half will receive placebo. Neither the patients nor their doctors will know whether a particular person has received lithium or placebo. The treatment will be administered and the patients will be followed for one year, after which patients will go back to usual care. Recruitment will occur over 3 years.~The investigators are primarily interested in whether lithium leads to increases in the time to the first repeated episode of suicidal behavior, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide. In addition, this study will allow us to explore whether lithium decreases the total number of suicidal behaviors, and whether it has comparable effects on impulsive and non-impulsive behaviors. If there is an effect of lithium, the investigators will be interested in whether or not it could be attributed to improved control of the underlying mental health condition, or, alternatively, whether it represents a direct effect of suicide-related behavior.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMust be a Veteran of the United States Armed Forces\nSurvived an episode of suicidal self-directed violence (including suicide attempts and interrupted attempts) that occurred within six months of admission to the study, or they were admitted within the past six months to a mental health inpatient unit specifically to prevent suicide\nHave a diagnosis of an affective disorder meeting DSM-IV-TR (2000) criteria for Bipolar I Disorder, Bipolar II Disorder, or current or recurrent Major Depressive Disorder\nAre able and willing to identify one or more family members, friends, or other contacts and give permission for both clinical providers and the Research Team to contact them if the patient cannot be reached\nAre able to provide informed consent\nThere is concurrence from the patient's mental health provider about inclusion/exclusion criteria and confirmation of the providers' willingness to work with the research team in managing the patient during the course of the study. The provider responsible for the patient's general medical care has been made aware of the participation\nMust be registered at a VA Medical Center\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 62-year-old man sees a neurologist for progressive memory loss and jerking movements of the lower extremities. Neurologic examination confirms severe cognitive deficits and memory dysfunction. An electroencephalogram shows generalized periodic sharp waves. Neuroimaging studies show moderately advanced cerebral atrophy. A cortical biopsy shows diffuse vacuolar changes of the gray matter with reactive astrocytosis but no inflammatory infiltration.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: A Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Low Dose Vaginal Estrogens in the Treatment of Atrophic Vaginitis\n\n\nSummary: Atrophic vaginitis is a common problem that occurs in up to 40% of postmenopausal women. The main symptoms are dryness, itching and burning in and around the vagina. These symptoms in turn can cause pain with intercourse. Other symptoms can include urinary frequency and urinary urgency. These symptoms are caused by the decreasing levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women.~The current treatment options include hormone replacement therapy by mouth and patch and vaginal creams, tablets and rings. The current guideline recommend using hormone therapy at the lowest dose for the shortest time. We are trying to find the lowest effective dose of estrogen cream that helps with symptoms without causing an increase in estrogens in the blood stream.~We want to compare two estrogen creams, estradiol and estriol, each at very low doses, with a placebo cream. Estradiol cream is available on prescription but we want to see how effective it is at one tenth the commonly prescribed dose. Estriol cream is not commonly prescribed and is only available at compounding pharmacies. We want to see if either of these estrogens is effective at one tenth the usual dose. We also want to see if these creams are effective when massaged onto the outer part of the vagina, rather than the usual method of treatment, which is inserting them into the vagina.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPostmenopausal women (no menses for the previous 12 months)\nDryness, itching or burning in and around the vagina\nDiscontinued hormone replacement therapy (either local or systemic) at least 3 months\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 43-year-old woman visits her dermatologist for lesions on her neck. On examination, multiple lesions are seen. Each lesion is small soft, and pedunculated. The largest lesion is about 4 mm in diameter. The color of different lesions varies from flesh colored to slightly hyperpigmented.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Cooling Lower Leg Skin to Prevent Venous Leg Ulcers in Patients With Poor Vein Circulation\n\n\nSummary: Leg vein circulation problems can damage the skin of the lower legs, especially around the ankles, by making it discolored, hard, itchy, red, and swollen. Ulcers often develop. Inflammation is often present in the damaged skin. This study will test whether using a special low compression, cooling, boot-like gel wrap placed around the damaged skin of the lower legs will improve the skin circulation and prevent leg ulcers. The study hypothesis is: A cryotherapy, low-compression cooling gel wrap (CW) plus usual care (UC) (leg elevation, compression stockings) intervention compared to a low compression non-cryotherapy sham wrap (NW) plus UC will reduce tissue blood flow (perfusion units) and decrease the incidence of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) during the 9-month study period in individuals with Stage 4 and 5 venous insufficiency.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\naged 21 years or older\nCEAP Classification: Stage C4 (skin damage) and 5 (healed VLU) - leg ulcer healed within past month with intact epithelium\nhistory of healed VLU within past 2 years\nankle brachial index (ABI) 0.80 - 1.3 mmHG, absence of peripheral arterial disease\nintact skin sensation\nintact thermal sensation\nagreement to ear compression during waking hours\nphone, email or mail accessible\nwillingness to make 5 study visits including baseline\nable to understand protocol by passing test after watching DVD standardized instructions for low literacy\nable to perform required protocol activities\nability to speak English\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 44 yo male is brought to the emergency room after multiple bouts of vomiting that has a \"coffee ground\" appearance. His heart rate is 135 bpm and blood pressure is 70/40 mmHg. Physical exam findings include decreased mental status and cool extremities. He receives a rapid infusion of crystalloid solution followed by packed red blood cell transfusion and is admitted to the ICU for further care.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Hemospray Versus the Combined Conventional Technique for Endoscopic Hemostasis of Bleeding Peptic Ulcers : A Pilot Study\n\n\nSummary: Hemospray (TC-325, Cook Medical Inc, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a new adsorptive nanopowder hemostatic agent for endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers, provides significant ease of administration compared to the combined conventional technique of saline-adrenaline injection with mechanical clip or heater probe applications. The Hemospray powder is easily applied on ulcers at difficult endoscopic positions and ulcers with fibrotic bases, where the combined conventional technique has limited efficacy. Building up on preliminary work from small single-arm studies, the investigators aim to establish the efficacy and safety of Hemospray in treating bleeding peptic ulcers in comparison with the combined conventional technique. The investigators propose a pilot study to establish our centre's feasibility of performing a prospective, randomized, parallel group trial, which compares the efficacy of Hemospray with the combined conventional technique, in the endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers will be treated with Hemospray to determine its initial hemostasis rate (defined as endoscopically verified cessation of bleeding for at least 5 minutes after endoscopic treatment), rebleeding rate (recurrent hemorrhage during a 4-week period following the initial hemostasis) and its safety profile.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPeptic ulcer with high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage (Forrest class IA, IB, IIA and IIB)\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 44-year-old man was recently in an automobile accident where he sustained a skull fracture. In the emergency room, he noted clear fluid dripping from his nose. The following day he started complaining of severe headache and fever. Nuchal rigidity was found on physical examination.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Evaluation of Brain Lesions in HIV-infected Patients for Diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma\n\n\nSummary: This study will evaluate the usefulness of two tests in quickly distinguishing whether a patient with HIV infection and focal brain lesions (an injury in a specific area of the brain) has a rare type of cancer called primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), or a parasitic infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis.~Toxoplasmic encephalitis is caused by a parasite and can be treated with antibiotics. PCNSL (lymphoma of the brain or spinal cord) must be definitively diagnosed with a brain biopsy (removal of a small piece of brain tissue), and the treatment is radiation therapy and chemotherapy.~The tests under study for diagnosing PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis are measurement of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and FDG-PET scan of the brain. EBV is often found in the CSF of people with PCNSL. The study also will compare the accuracy of two imaging techniques-TI-SPECT and FDG-PET-in distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and PCNSL.~Patients 18 years of age and older who have HIV infection and at least one focal brain lesion without a prior history of PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis may be eligible for this study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests and MRI scans of the brain.~Upon entering the study, all participants take medication to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis. They undergo lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to obtain CSF for analysis, an FDG-PET scan, and a 201TI-SPECT scan. For the PET scan, a radioactive substance is injected into an arm, followed by scanning in a doughnut-shaped machine similar to a CT scanner. SPECT is similar to PET but uses a different radioactive tracer, and the patient lies on a table while the SPECT camera rotates around the patient's head. Patients whose test results indicate a low risk for lymphoma continue antibiotic therapy for toxoplasmosis. They have repeat MRI scans around 4, 7, and 14 days after starting the drug to monitor the response to therapy. Antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients who are not already on such a regimen.~Patients whose test results indicate a high risk for PCNSL have a CT scan to look for evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body and are referred for consultation with a neurosurgeon to discuss undergoing a brain biopsy. The brain biopsy is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. A small cut is made in the scalp and a small opening is made in the skull over the area of the brain to be biopsied. A needle is placed in the opening in the skull and, guided by CT or MRI, moved to the abnormal area of the brain, where a small piece of tissue is removed for study under a microscope.~Patients found to have toxoplasmosis are discharged from the hospital to the care of their primary care physician after they are getting better and are tolerating all their medications. They return to NIH for follow-up visits about 4 weeks, and 6 months after discharge.~Patients found to have lymphoma are referred to the National Cancer Institute for screening for enrollment in a treatment protocol. Patients who are not eligible for a treatment protocol are referred back to their primary care physician or for another NIH treatment protocol, if one is available. Patients with lymphoma are seen at the NIAID outpatient clinic for follow-up visits and laboratory examinations every 3 months for 2 years.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAdult (18 years old or older) HIV-infected patient\nHIV infected by OraQuick rapid test using saliva, venipuncture whole blood, or fingerstick whole blood; or by reactive ELISA and Western Blot as determined by an outside CLIA-approved laboratory facility or by NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory or SAIC-Frederick Inc Monitoring Laboratory.

It is uncomfortable for patients and upsetting for their family. Although drugs like morphine and oxygen can help some patients feel better, they don't help everybody, and they are not used in patients with early symptoms. More relief is needed for these patients. The investigators are studying a drug called tiotropium, which is used in emphysema. It is an inhaler that opens the airways to allow easier breathing. Every patient will get the drug but also a placebo, in a random (flip of a coin) order. They will get each for 2 weeks. The investigators will see if they feel better with the drug.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically or cytologically proven incurable stage IIIb or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.\nDyspnea as defined by a score of 2 or higher on the 10-point Dyspnea Numeric Scale (Appendix 2).\nNew dyspnea or worsening dyspnea within the last 6 months per patient reporting.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Sometimes medicine that treats these infections does not get to where the bacteria are in the lungs. Researchers want to find a way to tell if enough medicine is getting to where it is needed in the lungs. They will look at how much medicine is in your sputum (what you cough up) compared to how much is in your blood. They will also investigate a new test to quickly figure out what medicines are likely to treat TB effectively.~Objective:~To determine the relationship between the concentration of TB drugs in plasma and sputum over time.~Eligibility:~People ages 18 and older who have TB or NTM infection that is suspected to be drug resistant. They must be taking TB or NTM medicines.~Design:~Participants will be screened with medical history.~Participants will be in the study for 2 8 days.~Participants will give 3 or more sputum samples over at least 2 different days. They will cough sputum into a cup.~Participants will have blood drawn 4 times a day on 2 different days.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAt least 18 years of age\nDiagnosis of TB (and/or NTM for NIH clinical center subjects)\nOngoing signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary TB (and/or NTM at the NIH CC)\nSuspected drug resistance (drug susceptible allowed at the NIH CC)\nAvailable to provide at least 3 sputa over 2 or more days\nTaking anti-tuberculosis medicines (or NTM meds at NIH CC) during the time sputa are provided\nThought likely to be Mycobacterium culture positive (including NTM infected for the NIH CC) by enrolling physician\nGeneXpert MTB/RIF sputum TBpositive (China subjects only)\nLikely able to produce sputum samples while on study\nWilling to provide blood samples\nWilling to have samples stored\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAcute liver or kidney disease\nConditions which compromise the subject s ability to take or absorb oral drugs\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 31 yo male with no significant past medical history presents with productive cough and chest pain. He reports developing cold symptoms one week ago that were improving until two days ago, when he developed a new fever, chills, and worsening cough. He has right-sided chest pain that is aggravated by coughing. His wife also had cold symptoms a week ago but is now feeling well. Vitals signs include temperature 103.4, pulse 105, blood pressure 120/80, and respiratory rate 15. Lung exam reveals expiratory wheezing, decreased breath sounds, and egophany in the left lower lung field.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Bacterial Pulmonary Infection in PICU\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to develop a scoring system to allow doctors to accurately identify children on a mechanical ventilator who have bacterial pneumonia. Currently this diagnosis is very difficult to make, resulting in the overuse of antibiotics and the promotion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Four ICUs at 3 children's hospitals will participate. Study participants will include 150 children, ages 2 months to 17 years old who require mechanical ventilation, and in whom the bedside health care providers suspect bacterial pneumonia. Bacteria will be studied by sampling lung fluid through the breathing tube less than 12 hours after starting antibiotics, using a procedure known as non-bronchoscopic-bronchoalveolar lavage (NB-BAL). Participants may be involved in study related procedures for up to 31 days.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nParent or legal guardian has signed the informed consent.\nAge greater than 48 weeks post-conception and less than 18 years of age.\nRequiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (subjects will not be intubated solely for the purpose of this study).\nPresence of an abnormal chest x-ray (CXR) as determined by the primary care team (Note: if the attending radiologist disagrees with the reading of abnormal CXR, the subject will be followed for safety and replaced for analysis).\nInitiation of antibiotics by the assigned health care providers for suspected bacterial pneumonia (must be less than or equal to 12 hours prior to undergoing non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage [NB-BAL]).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n</s> \n</s>",
