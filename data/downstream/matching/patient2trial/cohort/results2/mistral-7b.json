The study will evaluate the therapeutic potential of Losmapimod in reducing exacerbation rates, as well as secondary objectives including safety, effects on lung function, quality of life, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and biomarkers of disease and inflammation. The study will run for between 26 and 52 weeks, with a variable dosing regimen to allow for longer participation in the study and increased likelihood of observing exacerbation events. Approximately 200 participants will be randomized to the study, with the possibility of increasing the sample size to 600 participants.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- COPD diagnosis and severity: Participants must have a clinical history of COPD in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society definition, with evidence of airflow obstruction (defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1 equal to or less than 80% of predicted normal value calculated using Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference equation, with FEV1/FVC ratio",

Age: The patient is 26 years old, which falls within the age range of 18-65 years. \n2. Mental Disorder Episodes Diagnostic Interview Schedule (SCID): Bipolar disorder is a serious medical condition that falls under the umbrella of mood disorders. It is included in the DSM-IV classifications, which makes it a valid condition for this clinical study. The patient has a confirmed SCID diagnosis of Bipolar disorder. \n3. Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC): Insomnia is a common medical condition that affects many people. It is crucial to identifying individuals who may be at risk of suicide, as there is a link between chronic insomnia and suicide ideation. The patient presents with symptoms of insomnia, which makes her eligible for this study based on the RDC criteria. \n4. Medications: The patient takes lithium carbonate to treat her bipolar disorder and zolpidem, which is a hypnotic medication. Since the patient has a confirmed diagnosis of insomnia and currently takes a hypnotic medication, she meets this inclusion criteria. \n5. Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI): The SSI is a standard tool used to measure the severity of suicidal ideation in an individual. The patient has had difficulty sleeping, excessively anxiety and agitation, thoughts of suicide, and irritability, all of which may indicate suicidal ideation.

He also has both a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0 and Global Deterioration Scale < 3. The patient has had a minimum of 12 years of education. However, the patient does not meet the requirement for an informed family member or life partner interviewed to confirm the reliability of the subject interview, which is a key inclusion criterion. However, this can be addressed by including the family member or life partner in the study or conducting additional screening to verify the subject's reliability. Overall, given the patient's clinical presentation, I would highly recommend that he be referred for this clinical trial, which has the potential to shed light on the relationship between Sleep Disordered Breathing and Alzheimer's disease risk.</s>",

Physical examination reveals hyporeflexia with delayed relaxation of knee and ankle reflexes, and very dry skin. She moves and talks slowly.\n\nClinical trial: Title: Maternal Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy\n\nSummary: There is general agreement that thyroid gland function should be assessed in pregnant women. When the gland produces too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), all of the woman's bodily functions slow down, and there are problems with her baby's development. Until now, physicians have identified this problem on an individual basis (case-finding), but this approach misses many of the cases. Our trial aims to replace case-finding with a routine blood test that is highly effective at detecting hypothyroidism, thereby allowing treatment to correct the deficiency. This approach can eventually be implemented throughout the United States.\n\nInclusion Criteria: TSH value >98th centile in early pregnancy.\n\nEvaluation:\nGiven the patient's symptoms of hyporeflexia and delayed relaxation of knee and ankle reflexes, as well as her dry skin, it is possible that she may have hypothyroidism. However, the patient's age and medical history do not otherwise suggest hypothyroidism, and there is no indication that she is pregnant. Thus, based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether or not the patient has hypothyroidism.

This study is a prospective double blind randomized clinical trial. Vaginal and rectal GBS screening culture are carried out for all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation in our out-patient department. Subjects with vagina and rectum GBS colonization are invited to participate in our study after informed consent. A total of 200 pregnant women will participate in the study during the 12-months trial period. They are randomly assigned to one of the two groups.

The referenced treatment method for pain is the cold-packs, but a new treatment called hyperbaric CO2 cryotherapy or neurocryostimulation has been developed and is commonly used by high-level sports teams and rheumatologists. However, its efficacy has never been assessed within a military population.\n\nResearch design: This study was carried out on a French multicenter basis. The study consisted in a randomized controlled superiority trial and open-label prospective analysis in the treatment of 40-year-old military patients or younger suffering from acute ankle sprains. Two groups were made, patients were treated either by neurocryostimulation or by the referenced cryotherapy (cold-packs). The care protocol for both groups consisted in six supervised 30-minute-sessions within a period of three consecutive days.\n\nHypothesis: Neurocryostimulation is more effective in the treatment of pain severity resulting from an ankle sprain than the referenced treatment by cold-packs. Moreover, we theorized that the total consumption of paracetamol and the number of days of temporary inaptitude and of work exemption were lower in patients treated by neurocryostimulation.\n\nOutcomes: For each session, pain severity is assessed on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale at the beginning and at the end of session 20 minutes later after a four-step walk.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Age equal or less than 40 years-old;\n* Military subject;\n* Acute ankle injury;\n* To have completed and signed the informed consent.\n\nPatient eligibility: \n\nPatient note: A 56-year old Caucasian female complains of being markedly more sensitive to the cold than most people.

A new system for manipulating the catheters has recently been introduced into clinical practice (the Amigo Remote Catheter System (RCS)). This trial is designed to answer two primary questions: a) is the contact force (the force with which the catheter comes into contact with the heart) any different using the RCS to manual techniques, and b) are the resulting ablation lesions within the heart any different in terms of the volume and contiguity of the lesions produced. Additionally the investigators aim to determine how the two techniques compare in success (the proportion of patients whose heart rhythm disturbance is corrected by the procedure).\n\nInclusion Criteria:\natrial fibrillation\nscheduled for catheter ablation\n\nAssessment of Eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

        "output": "Based on the given patient note, the following Trial-level eligibility can be determined for Karen:\n\n1) Occasional palpitations and shortness of breath lasting for a few minutes and then stopping on their own suggest the possibility of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AF). It is unclear if the patient has a history of AF or if she required a cardioversion for the resolution of her symptoms. Patients with AF are at increased risk of developing ischemic stroke, and there is evidence that thrombolysis is safe and effective in this patient population. As such, I would further investigate Karen's history of palpitations and chest pain prior to the onset of her stroke to determine her suitability for inclusion in the study.\n\n2) Karen's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes may increase her risk of developing ischemic stroke. Hypertension and hyperglycemia are both well-established risk factors for stroke, and there is evidence that thrombolysis is safe and effective in patients with comorbid conditions. While Karen's hypertension and glucose are within normal ranges, it is still important to consider her overall health and comorbidities during the decision to refer her for the trial.\n\n3) Karen's history of acute ischemic stroke causing a measurable neurological deficit, as confirmed by her computed tomography, is a well-characterized indication for thrombolysis therapy, especially if her symptoms have not substantially improved before treatment. Even if her transesophageal echocardiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram are negative, these results are not necessary for inclusion in the study, as the primary goal of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients, regardless of underlying cause or evidence of vascular abnormalities.\n\n4) Karen is willing and able to comply with the study protocol. It is important to note that informed consent is critical for the conduct of any clinical study, and patients must fully understand the benefits and risks of participating. In this case, Karen's willingness to receive thrombolysis treatment is a good sign.\n\nBased on my assessment, I would recommend that Karen be considered for inclusion in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke - Monitor",

Every 3 months, participants will be reviewed with respect to function, intellect, mood and behaviours. Results between those with heart failure will be compared to those of people without heart failure. The results of this study will be used to plan further studies to see whether good treatment of heart failure can preserve function, intellect, and prevent depression and other mood problems.\n\nInclusion Criteria: All new residents to participating long-term care facilities, Age 65 or over.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Researchers want to collect data to better understand how exposure to various environmental factors can affect the long-term health of people with chronic asthma. Eligibility:~- Nonsmoking adults age 18 - 60 who have chronic asthma. Design: Participants will complete a medical history form before the first visit. Study visits will include collecting medical history, and conducting physical exam, lung and smoking tests. Participants will give blood, urine, stool, dust, saliva, and sputum samples. They will also fill out surveys. Participants will have visits every 6 months for 5 years. They can schedule sick visits, if needed, at no cost to the participant. For all visits, they will have asthma check-ups and get treatment, at no cost to the participant. Some participants may take part in a sub-study that includes one 4-hour visit. They will have medical history, physical exam, and lung tests. They will have urine tests to check for pregnancy and tobacco exposure. Then they will have bronchoscopy. For this, an intravenous line will be placed in an arm vein. The nose and throat will be numbed. A flexible fiber-optic tube will be inserted into their airways through the nose. Their airways will be examined and areas of their lung will be washed. A small sample of cells will be taken. Inclusion criteria: Participants must meet all of the following criteria for enrollment: Male or female, 18 to 60 years of age, and have a diagnosis of chronic asthma.

However, older age is often considered a risk factor for influenza and CMV infection, and the study is interested in whether this infection affects responses to vaccination in older adults. Therefore, we cannot rule out this criterion.\n4. Owl's Eye Inclusion Bodies on BAL fluid examination:\nThis criterion is not specifically mentioned in the inclusion criteria, but it is relevant to the study since the patient was diagnosed with influenza during his illness. It is possible that he has had a past or current infection with CMV, which is known to be associated with influenza. The study is interested in how CMV status affects responses to flu vaccination in older adults, and this criterion may be relevant to the study.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, the 62-year-old male patient has owl's eye inclusion bodies on BAL fluid examination, which may be important to the study, but he is not currently infected with CMV and there is no written informed consent or contraindication to vaccination mentioned in his chart.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

Nosocomial pneumonia is defined as pneumonia that occurs while in a hospital or health-care facility and can be caused by a number of different bacteria and viruses. The patient's current symptoms and examination findings do not meet the criteria for nosocomial pneumonia.\n\nSecondly, the patient does not have infections in the intra-abdominal cavity, which is defined as an infection that occurs in any part of the abdominal cavity, including the stomach, spleen, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum. The patient's examination findings do not suggest any abnormalities in the intra-abdominal cavity, so the patient does not meet this inclusion criterion either.\n\nThe patient also does not have any urinary tract infections, which are defined as infections that occur in any part of the urinary tract, including the bladder, ureters, urethra, and kidneys. The patient's examination findings do not suggest any abnormalities in the urinary tract, so the patient does not meet this inclusion criterion either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given patient note, the patient would not be eligible for this clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.</s>",

However, he recently developed fever, chills, and worsening cough. The patient has right-sided chest pain that is aggravated by coughing. His wife also had similar symptoms a week ago but is now feeling well. The patient's vital signs include temperature 103.4, pulse 105, blood pressure 120/80, and respiratory rate 15. A lung exam reveals expiratory wheezing, decreased breath sounds, and egophony in the left lower lung field.\n\nWhile the patient does not have a history of chest infections post lung transplant, he meets some of the inclusion criteria for this clinical trial, including being productive of sputum and having a pulmonary exacerbation as defined by Fuchs et al. However, the patient was not defined as being capable of performing airway clearance techniques or nebulisers, which is also an important inclusion criterion. Therefore, I would consider referring this patient for further evaluation to determine their eligibility for the clinical trial.</s>",
