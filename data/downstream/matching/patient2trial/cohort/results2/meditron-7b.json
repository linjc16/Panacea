The tasks you will cover now are the ones that are most commonly performed in clinical NLP: part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and named entity recognition.\n\nFor each sentence, we will provide a text file, and you need to provide the output file, containing part-of-speech tags and parsing results. \nWe used the dependency parsing methods of CoNLL and BioNLP-ST. This is the output of the example sentence when parsing using CoNLL.\nThe words highlighted in red are verbs in the sentence, and we can perform parsing on the verbs by dependency parsing.\n\nParentheses in CoNLL indicate the beginning and end of the words.\n\n```\nSuch methods are more suitable for tasks such as clinical trials.\n```\nA CoNLL parse tree visualized by OpenNLP is shown below: *The words with the prefix `root_` in the graph are called the parents in parse trees, whereas those without a prefix are called the children. The roots of the sentence are denoted with _1_. *A node in CoNLL is a class with a name and an array of 10 values. This parsing model is simple and suitable for parsing tasks such as text tagging and parsing. OpenNLP is an open source dependency parsing system.\nAs you can see, it is a hierarchical graph where dependencies can be made between any pair of words. For example, `root_1 nsubj passive such methods` is the subject and `the verbs in the sentence are verbs, whereas `1 prep is more` is the object of the verb `Such methods`. \nThe parser used in BioNLP-ST has a complex parsing tree topology and provides many tree-based features, such as lexical information (left, right, head) and dependency labels.\nThe following is the parse tree diagram from the ST parse results:\n\n```\nTRAIN EFFECT BIOMECHANISMS PHARMACOLOGIC BLACKSBURG UNIV UVA BLACKSBURG IMPACTS MEDICAL MILE",

Within a few days all the flies died and their dead bodies wrere cut open, but no sipirochdtes were found in the fly itself.\nOne fly containing spirilla was then put in another test-tube with fresh warm milk in which a guinea-pig was placed. About six hours after the fly was fed, both the fly and the guinea-pig died from putrescence. On cut surface of the liver of the guiniea-pig about 50 or more spirochajetes were found in one small space of cut surface of liver of the guinea-pig.\nExperiments with Spirochaetes in the Laboratory.?The following experiments were made with spirochdte cultures.\nFresh guinea-pigs were killed and their muscles were cut in a sterile pettolein bottle and placed under a cover in a warm place. The pettolein culture was then flooded with the spirochaetes. As a result, several of the guinea-pigs in 24 hours showed fever and had to be killed. After a time they developed in the abdominal cavity a characteristic suppurating lesion and soon died from sepsis.\nThe following are observations of the characteristic lesion of bovine spiirillosis from the laboratory experiments, also made some time ago; viz., A strait round swelling developed in the muscles, followed by the formation of abscess.

As you work through the solutions, it is important to pay special attention to the comments. For example, the comments will tell you the exact name of the functions (e.g., `Trial-level_eligibility()`) you need to call to solve the assignment, which might be useful knowledge for you later in the course. In addition, the comments will tell you the functions you need to call once you have written the functions and methods.\n\n# Using Functions, Methods, Variables, and Objects\nTo solve this assignment, you will have to use functions, methods, variables, and objects to help you in your solution. This section will discuss how these programming tools will be used in your solution.\n\n## Defining Variable Names\nThere is a lot of confusion about using variable names in a scientific manner. To help you identify when you have properly used or not used variable names, follow these guidelines:\n\nThe naming convention for variables begins with underscores (\"_\"). These variables are to be used for internal workings within a function. For example, the name for the patient note is \"_patient note\"; \"_patient trial\" is the name of the patient note for a given clinical trial. The name of a patient for a clinical trial is \"_patient\".\n\nVariables such as \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"n\", etc., are reserved for global arrays in the language. If you use these names, the code will not work. If the variables begin with either an uppercase letter (\"R\", \"S\", \"T\", etc.) or a lowercase letter (\"r\", \"s\", \"t\", etc.), Python will interpret them as variables but will report an error. Variables such as \"s\" (one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter) will result in a different error (see below).\n\nVariables should follow these general rules:\n\n* no leading zeros (000 or 00)\n\n* no leading spaces in front of numeric values (0_patient)\n\n* no spaces at the end of variables\n\n* no apostrophe in the variable name, as in ``'I_am'\".   _i_am becomes _iam",

The cytotoxic and cytokine-producing functional status of CD8+ T cells in tumors, serum IL2 levels, and patient 5-year survival rate were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We observed that the expression of FoxP3+CD8+ T cells correlated with favorable characteristics and improved survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. FoxP3+CD8+ T cells infiltrated tumor and/or peritumor stroma in some hepatocellular carcinoma patients and FoxP3+CD8+ T cells positively correlated with increased IL2 protein secretion and IL2 levels in serum. Our data suggest that the function of FoxP3+CD8+ T cells might differ depending on the CD8 T cell phenotype and/or the tumor microenvironment.

C4bBP is extensively phosphorylated in the blood, on seven serine residues. In this study, we show that C4bBP phosphorylation protects it from cleavage by the membrane attack complex (MAC), a supramolecular assemblage of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 on cellular surfaces. Purified C4bBP was cleaved by the MAC, especially in the presence of heparin, although the extent of this cleavage was lower than that observed for C3g but comparable to that observed for C9g. Phosphorylated C4bBP was far less susceptible to MAC cleavage. In fact, nonphosphorylated 32P-labeled C4bBP was not cleaved. Interestingly, native C4bBP was found to be cleaved by MAC in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individual, despite a lack of significant C4bBP phosphorylation. It is highly likely that C4bBP cleavage results in an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. In addition, the reduced cleavage of C4bBP is partially responsible for the increased immune complexes that accumulate on the surface of the cells of these patients.<EOD> Recipes and notes \u203a\u203a Baked \u203a\u203a Salads and Side Dishes \u203a\u203a Zucchini-baked corn, peanut butter, and balsamic dressing salad\nZucchini-baked corn, peanut butter, and balsamic dressing salad\nYield: 4 servings\nIngredients:\n1 large orange bell pepper, cut into large wedges",

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between marijuana use and cause of death. Design: This was a retrospective chart analysis of all cases reported to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office (SDCMEO), an office which serves all deaths in the City of San Diego and in certain areas of neighboring Southwestern States, from January 1989 to December 2008. A computer retrieval system was reviewed to identify fatalities related to the use of marijuana. A total of 12\u2009755 autopsies were performed during this 20-year period. Results: Of these, 10.97% (1358/12\u2009755) reported marijuana-related deaths. The most common cause of death for those who did not have any other contributing drug, and who had marijuana as the only drug, was suicide at 91.44% (127/138).

A severe attack of pancreatic necrosis and peritonitis is the usual cause of death in patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Thus the value of early diagnosis and prompt operation is obvious. As the symptoms in patients with malignant disease of the head of the pancreas are usually those of obstructive jaundice\u2014i.e. anorexia, nausea, and weight loss\u2014early diagnostic assessment is simple. Unfortunately, at this early stage of tumour progression, diagnosis is still difficult. The extent and severity of jaundice can be estimated at its worst, and the time between the onset of jaundice and the appearance of hepatic failure provides a guide to the prognosis, which is more useful in clinical decision-making than the jaundice alone. A retrospective analysis of the cases of obstructive jaundice seen at this hospital in the last decade and in whom the diagnosis was not known when the patient presented in hospital is presented below. The patients are described using the terminology adopted under the auspices of the B.A.R. Committee on Obstructive Jaundice (1964). The group is not large, and there are therefore considerable overlaps in subgroups and individual grades of jaundice. The most frequent diagnosis was carcinoma of the liver (55 per cent); obstructive jaundice from duodenal ulcer or chronic pan.creatitis accounted for 16\u00b71 per cent and from pancreatic carcinoma for 11 per cent. There were 9 per cent of cases of obstructive jaundice of undetermined origin.

Bone formation was assessed by bone isopropyl (p)-amino-proprionid acid excretion and bone resorption by urine pyriduria of total pyridinoline (Pyr Py), deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr Py), and free Pyr Py in the 24-hour urine. BMD at the spine was below normal even in patients who were 1 month post-transplant; in contrast, the BMD determined at the total body remained within the normal range. Lumbar BMD normalized within 8 to 12 months after transplantation. No correlation was apparent between BMD at the spine or total body and serum calcitriol, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Bone formation was well below normal even in patients whose transplantations had been performed 1 year or longer. The pyridine crosslinks were increased in serum PTH levels. In a subset of patients, they correlated positively with the serum iPTH level (r = 0.36 to 0.64) but not with any other endogenous factors. The results show that the low BMD after transplantation develops early after transplantation and normalizes thereafter and that bone turnover, in contrast to BMD, remains elevated.

The N-terminal domain of human Nucleolin is unique of the mammalian Nucleolin species. We cloned and expressed the N-terminal fragment of human Nucleolin (1-243 amino acids) in baculovirus. We showed that this domain of Nucleolin (N-terminal domain) is able to bind in vitro with a high affinity the double-stranded DNA homologous to the promoter region of the c-myc gene and to the purine-rich sequence located within c-myc coding region. Moreover, we found that the N-terminal domain represses in vitro transcription of c-myc gene both in the presence and in the absence of nuclear extract. This study suggests that the N-terminal domain of human Nucleolin can be included in the family of transcription factors",

The number of errors and reaction times were assessed while using standard auditory (S-TD) versus Hw-TD devices connected to an external audio player that administered standard digits and arithmetic problems. In addition, verbal responses in correct/incorrect format were also recorded for comparison with the results of the arithmetic test. The study included 30 participants aged 25-40 years (15 young adults and 15 middle-aged adults). The participants' performance and reaction times were assessed in two consecutive sessions. First were assessed in the Hw-TD session (using the Hw-TD device connected to a laptop), and were than performed on the standard auditory (S-TD) device session (using it connected to an external audio player connected to a laptop). Two standard cognitive tests were applied to evaluate the participants' performance. The first test was the mental transposition test (MTT), and the second was numeral subtraction test (NST). The results showed that participants made less errors in the Hw-TD session. The average reaction time was the same in both sessions. No significant results were detected for the MTT; however, statistically significant results were detected for NST tests. A significant impact of device type was found with reaction times. Reaction times were shorter in the Hw-TD session compared to the S-TD session only for the digit 9. Our results showed that the Hw-TD improves participants' performance in the NST by reducing the number of errors made, especially for the digit 9.\n\n# Introduction\nAttention is described as the ability to divide resources and to selectively focus on aspects of the environment.

Two of the more prominent isozymes could be resolved by phosphocellulose paper chromatography and exhibited Mr values of 90 kD and 80 kD in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Although the two bands co-migrated in 10-15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, these preparations showed clearly that, under conditions of electrophoresis that maintain non-covalent interactions, the Mr 90 band migrated cathodally more rapidly than the Mr 80 isozyme. On the basis of these differences, and considering that the Mr 80 isozyme, unlike the Mr 90 isozyme, lacks an N-terminal glycosylation site, it was concluded that the two differentially phosphorylated isozymes were structurally closely related but were at least heterophosphorylated at different sites.<EOD> Intrathecal administration of the neuropeptide galanin produces prolonged reversal of thermal hyperalgesia in the rat.\n1.

However, personality traits have been proposed as modifying and explanatory factors for the relationship between parent monitoring and adolescent substance use. Nevertheless, no studies to date have yet tested the possible mediating or conditional indirect effect of personality traits for this relationship using a structural equation and multilevel framework. Furthermore, although the most widespread instruments to assess personality dimensions combine personality traits as dimensions of temperament or character (e.g., TEMPS-A and CCQT), no studies have tested the conditional indirect effect of both temperament and character on parent monitoring and substance use. A sample of 1092 parents and adolescents was used (average age = 44.89 and 14.11, respectively). First, the mediating role of adolescent temperament and character traits was examined in a conditional indirect effect model. Second, temperament and character traits were simultaneously examined in a simultaneous mediation model. No mediating or conditional indirect effects for the relationship between parental monitoring and adolescent substance use were observed. However, the results showed the existence of a complementary mediating role of certain temperamental variables (depressive mood and impulsiveness) on the relationship between parental monitoring and adolescent substance use. This study showed no mediation or conditional indirect effects linking parental monitoring and substance use through temperament and character traits. However, adolescents with high levels of depressive mood and impulsiveness showed higher levels of substance use, and the moderator effect of temperamental dimensions was observed on the relationship between parental monitoring and substance use.

It is shown that the polarity of the solvent used to dissolve the polymer strongly affects all three damage processes and consequently the threshold. The UV laser damage initiation was monitored by analyzing the spectra of photomicrograph of the discolored film. An empirical relationship describing the threshold versus photon energy for UV irradiation is presented.<EOD> Evaluating an intervention to reduce social inequalities in alcohol use\n\nBackgroundWe reported previously that the intervention was not effective in reducing binge drinking frequency or frequency of not using a condom in the past year.

The two rice subspecies, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and O. sativa ssp. indica, are the two most important subspecies (subgroup) in the Oryza genus. One intersubspecific cross was investigated in this study for the hybrid breeding between these two subspecies, but its offspring was an obligate hybrid. In this study, we performed a genome-wide microarray experiment to uncover the altered expression of genes between the hybrid and their progenitor subspecies. Results: The expression profile of each subspecies' genes showed the obvious diverging tendency. In the hybrid, the expression level of genes showed alterations between the two subspecies with significant variation tendencies detected at 3 time points. Furthermore, those genes shared similar expression patterns were found to participate in the same GO functions. These altered genes, most of which showed up-regulation, encoded proteins involved in basic metabolism and development, cellular transcription and RNA splicing, and signal transduction during the early stages of hybrid development. Conclusion: In this study, the different altered expression levels of the genes between the hybrid and its parent subspecies are related to the different parental genomes in the intersubspecific hybridizations, and their expression changes were involved in genetic divergence and speciation. These large-scale altered genes are useful for us to uncover the possible mechanisms of natural hybridization and speciation or of new gene expression regulation caused by hybridization and speciation.\n\n# Background\nHybridization is an important contributing factor in evolution.

Echocardiographically, the arch was seen to be narrow and hypoplastic. We performed surgical repair with aortopulmonary bypass on postoperative day 6. Aorta-to-aorta anastomosis was performed between the ascending aorta and the false lumen of the descending aorta, as our patient's subarch bronchus and duodenum were compressed by the true lumen, which was much thinner than normal. After reconstruction of the descending aorta, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was closed with a Teflon pledget suture ligature. We planned the next operation to resect the subaortic ridge to enlarge the outflow tract of the left ventricle later. On postoperative day 4, the patient was extubated to continuous positive airway pressure. On postoperative day 20, tracheostomy was removed. On postoperative day 80, aortography was performed to verify the correct alignment of the graft, and to evaluate by aortic arch circulation was adequate and the left ventricle was functioning normally.

The mechanism underlying this interaction has been well studied using proteolytic activation or mutational studies at the heparin-binding site. These studies have suggested that a conformational change in the S1\u2032-subdomain triggers the heparin-binding event, and this change is thought to be critical for thrombin binding to its peptide substrates. Mutations disrupting the structural integrity of S1\u2032-subdomain reduce the heparin-binding ability of thrombin. The purpose of this study is to use molecular dynamics simulations of thrombin to investigate the role of the S1\u2032-subdomain in heparin binding. A 42-ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed in order to study the conformational changes in heparin-binding site of thrombin. It was found that the S1\u2032-subdomain undergoes structural changes upon heparin binding. We also found that a water molecule acts as a bridge for Glu51 and Arg56. These two residues are known to be important for heparin binding. Our results suggest that a water molecule acts as a link between Glu51 and Arg56 to form a highly active binding site on the thrombin surface\u2014this water molecule is part of a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic residues involved in the thrombin-heparin interaction.<EOD> Genetic variation in the promoters of the P-glycoprotein ABCB1 gene and its relationship with human brain volume\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that genetic variation in the promoter region of the P-glycoprotein ABCB1 gene (MDR1) is associated with human brain size.

Methods Participants were 45 pregnant women in an antenatal care setting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. In order to examine the predictors for exclusive and partial breastfeeding cessation, we performed a cross-sectional analysis (n=40) using logistic regression analysis. The cutoff points of antenatal depressive symptoms were based on a validated measure. results The main analyses indicated that women with depressive symptoms were more likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding within 1 month of delivery. No significant association was found between depressive symptoms and partial breastfeeding at 6 months. A multilevel logistic regression indicated a possible link between participants' perception of their partner's pregnancy-related anxiety and non-breastfeeding status at 6 months (p=0.057), while this effect was non-significant in the main analysis. conclusions Antenatal depressive symptoms may be related to exclusive breastfeeding cessation, and the perception of partner's pregnancy-related anxiety may predict non-breastfeeding status at 6 months postpartum.\n\n# Introduction\nExclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is one of the greatest contributions to child survival, growth and development, especially during the newborn period.It is associated with a reduced risk of diarrhoea, pneumonia and infectious diseases,which have been proven to be leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age.In developed countries, the most common reasons for breastfeeding cessation among mothers are the perceived insufficient milk supply, work and/or time constraints, pressure from family and friends to introduce (complementary) foods to the infant,and depressive problems.Breastfeeding cessation among mothers from developing countries is linked to health",

You are a helpful assistant for the diagnosis of a rare condition named Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\n## Cardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium (the heart muscle) characterized by the weakening and deterioration of the heart muscle. It leads to an inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood towards the body, or can sometimes cause sudden heart failure.Cardiac muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle can't pump blood as well as it should. Cardiomyopathy weakens the heart. It makes it harder to pump the blood around the body. There are several types of cardiomyopathy. One of these types is named Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The symptoms of Takotsubo, or \"broken heart syndrome,\" are very similar to those of a heart attack, although no blockage of a coronary artery occurs.\n\n## Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\nTakotsubo Cardiomyopathy, also known as Broken Heart Syndrome, is a \"heart attack of the heart. In a typical heart attack, a coronary artery becomes blocked. As a result, the heart's flow of blood is reduced. In Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, the heart's main muscle becomes inflamed. The heart's muscle is damaged by the buildup of a lot of fluid in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has trouble pumping blood to the body.\nYour job is to evaluate the patient's heart. You are going to compare it with healthy people.\n\n## Patient\nA",

        "output": "#### Q. Can all your patients be assessed in this task? \nYes. For example, if we encounter a patient below the age limit listed in the trial, we can set `Age in years: ` to be below 18 years. We can set `Type of disease: ` to `Cancer` so that this patient cannot be assessed as potentially eligible anymore. As long as our patient's status meets the requirements of the trial, he/she will be assessed as eligible by default. \n\n## Trivia: I'd like to share this anecdote with you. The clinical trial in the challenge, as I mentioned in the previous section, is called Evaluation of Integrated Cardiac Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease. I really liked the idea of `integrated` here, not separated, not disintegrated, a combination, a collaboration, a unification, a cooperation, a mutual support, or a coordination, all of `integrated' meanings were good, for example, `a group of people that are working together' (in English, there is actually no word like integrated, only `integration` is used to mean a joined or joined with others). However, if we consider this medical trial, the integration (cooperation) of different imaging modalities should not be emphasized. The imaging modalities included in this clinical trial, namely, echocardiography, CT angiography (CTA) and coronary angiography, are complementary ones (some overlap is inevitable). \n\n## Preparation Phase.\nThe patient (Note: a person who is going to be assessed for eligibility) is usually assessed with history taking and physical examination. Therefore, you must know the clinical trial information of the patient before determining the final Trial-level eligibility. \n\n## Solution\n\nTo solve this challenge, we suggest the use of the library [pysas](https://github.com/sas/pysas), which is an SAS wrapper for Python. You may refer to the official tutorial of [Using PySAS](https://doc.sas.com/en/webapps/pySAS/usingpySAS.html) to create your project and then import it. In the process of importing, you can",

Although biochemical evaluation is sometimes sufficient to diagnose the disease early in life, it is typically not until later, when the complications of the disease such as blindness and renal failure develop, that the diagnosis is clear in the mind of the attending physician. This early clinical presentation is not infrequently confounded by the effects of severe intercurrent infection. Vitamin B12 treatment is frequently not commenced until the biochemical phenotype has been defined by chromatographic, chromatofocusing, or gel electrophoretic analysis of the methylmalonyl CoA mutase protein extracted from the patient's cells. This can be a time-consuming process and an unnecessary delay in administering the potentially beneficial treatment. A rapid immunological assay for the presence of protein in patient erythrocytes from the vitamin B12-responsive form of methylmalonic aciduria has been developed that is specific, easily applied, and gives useful biochemical information.

It is also important to investigate the possibility of automatic analysis and visualization of patient note contents based on text mining. It is very ambitious to try to use natural language processing to detect the eligibility of a patient by comparing patient note to a trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria list using a computer system. This may add great value to doctors, but the challenge to get enough training data to develop a robust computer algorithm for the automatic detection and classification is not an easy task.

However, the IEF can be considered negligible compared to the electric field (EF) induced by the current in the temperature gradient (TG) due to the high aspect ratio between the in-plane dimension and out-plane dimension of bulk thermoelectrics. It is believed that there should be a special material which satisfies the same aspect ratio for the validity of the above approximation. The IEF, EF, and TG are mutually orthogonal directions in this case. Here, we used  p-type Ge-Te-Sn (GeTe-2%Sn) as an experimental material to achieve mutually orthogonal TG, EF, and IEF. We discovered that the TG-induced EF and IEF had opposite effects on the Seebeck coefficient (S) of GeTe-2%Sn, while they had comparable effects on its electrical conductivity \u03c3. The EF and IEF also had opposite effects on the total entropy generation coefficient Sgtotal. By using the Fourier analysis method, we also quantitively analyzed the influence of the EF (IEF) and the TG on the S (\u03c3) as a function of frequency. The present investigation is expected to shed light on the validity of the approximation and will benefit the experimental and theoretical study of bulk thermoelectrics and nanogenerators.<EOD> Assessing the contribution of matrotrophy to maternal nutrient management in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus.\nEggs and larvae of pelagic teleosts are nutritionally autonomous for the first few days after hatching. This allows the mother to regulate the nutrient content of the yolk (the yolk sac) using maternal energy stores as a reserve, and to vary the amount of food the offspring receives during larval development. In the present study, we investigated the effects of variation in yolk sac content (sacnutrient content) on larval growth of Atlantic cod (Gad",

Recently, we have investigated the polymerization of benzoxazoles (Xu et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2011). Herein, we report the molecular structure of the title compound, which was isolated in crystalline form during the preparation of benzoxazole by ring-opening of oxa-analogon of 4-aza-5-heptonate with substituted benzaldehydes and 4-hydroxy-2,6-dioxocyclohexanone (Scheme 1). The asymmetric unit of title compound(Fig. 1)contains three independent molecules, A, B and C, which are located on crystallographic 2-fold rotation axes. Bond lengths and angles are in normal ranges(Kirkland, 2006), and are comparable to known values.In the polymers, the benzoxazole ring (C11/C12/O2/C18-C20) is nearly planar, with maximum deviations of 0.020 (5) \u00c5 for atom O2 and 0.047 (5) \u00c5 for atom C18.

The report showed an astonishing 71% percent in 1995 of all births among American teens to be unintended. Over a quarter of teenagers had been sexually active in the year that preceded their interview, with two-thirds of these young men and women reporting that they did not use a method of birth control that could reliably prevent pregnancy before intercourse began.

Despite its high prevalence and negative outcomes, the diagnosis of AF is complicated by its variable manifestation and interim periods of normal sinus rhythm (NSR), during which its presence can only be confirmed by standard electrocardiogram (ECG).

Methods: Sixty-four patients with AS and 37 healthy controls were observed for this retrospective study. Gait variables were recorded with an instrumented walking mat (GaitRite\u2122) and used to calculate step length, single support, and variability for each foot separately. Foot pressure distribution was examined. Disease characteristics and functional outcome scales, such as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index were also used. Data were compared among the involved limbs of patients, among AS patients and healthy controls.Results: Diseased individuals showed a shorter step length in the involved limbs (90.2 cm) than in the contralateral limbs (92.7 cm) and on the healthy side (93.0 cm) (P < 0.0001); however, the difference was not found to be significant (P > 0.05) among the different groups. In addition, the peak single support time of the involved limbs in AS patients and healthy controls was found to be higher than the contralateral limbs at the initial contact time, but not significant (P > 0.05). The pressure values under the heel and foot were also found to be higher in the active limbs (872.03 and 270.52 mg/s) than the contralateral limbs (664.59 and 215.75 mg/s) and healthy controls (739.06 and 250.20 mg/s) (P < 0.0001 for pressure under the heel, P < 0.05 for pressure under the foot).

The detection platform, referred to in this study as the Microbial Detection Array, consists of four arrayed, individually addressable, field-effect transistor-based chemi- and biosensors fabricated using standard, semiconductor manufacturing technologies. The individual chemically responsive and bacteriometric sensors were developed so as to provide separate information on pH and the presence of cell surface-bound L-arabinose, respectively. Initial results have confirmed the ability of the system to conduct specific, real-time, whole-cell detection of a culture of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium in unprocessed water, while simultaneously measuring its pH level.

In this study, a dissipative system driven by an intrinsic stochastic force in a high energy state is presented. Two kinds of systems are discussed: one is a single system driven by a stochastic Lorentz force (the L-system) and the other is a coupled system driven by two stochastic Lorentz forces (the C-system). Although the L-system and the Csystem show the same macrostate, there appear to be two kinds of microstates: the energy microstates, which correspond to the energy states in conventional statistical mechanics, and the st",

Both MBP and PLP are rich in amino acid residues, which determine their susceptibility to hydrolyse by a range of endopeptidases. Moreover, peptides, which are generated by hydrolytic processing of MBP and PLP, have been shown to have pathogenic potential in experimental animals and are immunogenic in multiple sclerosis patients. Thus far, no experimental model has been identified that is suitable to predict efficacy of candidate drugs directed against multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the exact pathogenesis in multiple sclerosis at the cellular and molecular level is not known. We have developed a new experimental model, where Lewis rats are actively sensitized to MBP. Induced immune responses mimic very closely those observed in multiple sclerosis patients, and the disease was fully reversible with immunosuppressive drugs. We have investigated the effects of the novel immunosuppressive agent, FK\u2010506, together with those of cyclophosphamid for their ability to reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

What is the role of classifiers such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines in data science?   \n\nWhen working with data, we want to find insights and derive knowledge that will then help us make better decisions. Data science is the field of study found at the intersection of data, statistical models and machine learning methods. In the era of big data (a large and complex set of data), we want to develop robust predictive models to provide the ability to handle such data and build a better picture of it. \n\nSome predictor variables have to be transformed to be used as inputs of a predictive model. Some values from the variables do not make sense for the model. For example, values around two are considered to be outliers for predicting a body mass index (BMI). We transform variables to make their values more in line with data analysis. Some predictors are categorical variables. To make them understandable for the model, they are represented with a number. To calculate a numeric value for the categorical data, one can use a dummy encoding technique where it is converted into zero for the first category and one for other category. It works like assigning a value as (number for first category) and (number for another category). \n\nWe can choose a regression (statistical model, to predict the value of an outcome variable), classifier (a machine learning model), or a clustering model, if we have a categorical outcome. In case the response is categorical, classification and regression models can be used. If the response is numerical and the variables are numerical then regression models are used. On the other hand, if the variables are categorical but the response is numerical, we can use classification models. In this case, the categorical response is categorized into groups and the model will predict the values.   \n#### Support Vector Machine:\n- The best-known and widely used approach in machine learning, also called a support vector classifier or support vector machine is a supervised learning approach that is used to categorize data and can be used to generate the binary classification. It is a binary classifier used to classify data points with only two classes. It also assigns weights to the two classes, where the maximum weight is equal to the maximum loss or the sum of the class error. This is known as a cost function. Each point has a specific weight assigned. The cost",

Here, we review all reintroductions published for amphibians and reptiles undertaken by 13 European Union member states in the last five decades, and evaluate the success of the programs. To identify general attributes of successful versus unsuccessful reintroductions we first searched the scientific literature for species with previous successful and failed reintroductions, then gathered information on the reintroduction program. Across the 27 reintroductions of amphibians, 20 are ongoing, and in five species the populations have recovered to numbers or densities similar to those present before their declines (five species are extinct in the wild). In contrast, only four of 17 of amphibian reintroductions have been considered successes, although another three populations appear to be at least recovering. Among reptiles, the two reintroductions of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) considered successful are both ongoing; the two reintroductions of the threatened Spur-thighed Tortoise ( Testudo graeca ) had variable success, and at least one of the three reintroductions for Spiny-tailed agama (Stellagama stellio) may be close to extinction. Across all amphibians and reptiles, some key attributes of reintroduction success were low numbers of introduced individuals, low stocking densities, high quality habitat of the release site, avoidance of large stressors like predators, absence of conspecific competition, and avoidance of inbreeding through selection of diverse founders. Most successful reintroductions were based on captive-bred individuals",

The cells, from which the glyceraldehyde had been removed, continued to divide in a medium containing glycerol or glucose when cultured on gelatin-coated glass cover-slips. Suppression of cell division by glyceraldehyde was seen even when the growth medium was completely changed on a daily basis. Suppression was not produced by glyceraldehyde phosphate in the absence of magnesium ions. However, a toxic effect was produced in these cells only in the presence of magnesium ions. Glyceraldehyde inhibited pyruvate kinase, glutamic dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-glycerophosphate oxidase. In Ehrlich ascites tumour ceils inoculated into normal mice the specific activity of these enzymes was reduced; with glyceraldehyde treatment, however, the enzymic activities were increased, approaching the control values in some cases.

You are an expert in assessing patient's eligibility to participate in clinical trial. You are now given a clinical trial note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal.

But these studies have not looked at the way different racial backgrounds can affect the way the blood forms clots. Minorities, such as African-Americans are underrepresented. Therefore, we are conducting this platelet reactivity study to better understand if there are differences in how this drug affects African-Americans from how they affect Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving ticagrelor. These data will be compared to a historical control of Caucasian patients who underwent similar platelet function testing.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nFemale (post menopausal or surgically sterile",

Escherichia coli metabolizes m-aminobenzoic acid (m-ABA) via two pathways, one dependent on oxygen uptake and the other inactive in the anaerobic phase of growth.\n2. Treatment of E. coli with cysteine results in a change of the ratio between the activities of these two pathways; m-ABA assimilation rate increases.\n3. This effect of cysteine is accompanied by a depletion of the m-ABA reductase and by a partial inhibition of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of the latter compound.\n4. Both the m-ABA reductase and the aminotransferase activity of E. coli are stimulated by L-methionine and 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid.\n5. Inhibition of the m-ABA reductase seems to be due to changes in the concentrations of the two substrates of the enzyme: the formation of \u03b3-glutamic acid and the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of the latter compound.<EOD> .\nBrucellae have two peaks of growth (stationary phases); late logarithmic phase (6th hour) and early stationary phase (8th hour).

We compared patients who were in persistent MR (persMR) versus those who were not (by 1-, 2-, and 3-year landmark intervals) to demonstrate time to persMR. The results indicate that age, gender, Sokal prediction or Sokal prediction status (negative or positive), presence of baseline BCR/ABL positive cells, and BCR/ABL transcript at <10% were not associated with persMR achievement when assessed as a univariate or multivariate analysis. Persistence of MR was not associated with BCR/ABL fusion transcript type, and a cytogenetic response to treatment was found in 83% with MR. These data can be used to design future studies on whether other patients with CML are able to achieve persistent MR.Clinical trials have indicated that most patients treated with imatinib mesylate (IM) can achieve a CCyR, which was found to be the most important predictor of achieving long-term remissions 1-3 .

As the markers for changes in protein synthesis, the accumulation of intracellular RNA and cytotoxic action, the morphological state of the cells during incubation was estimated. The obtained data testify to the presence of a number of specific processes in tumour cell cultures which are the cause of changes in the cell phenotype. The mechanism of the cytotoxic action of R-2431, R-2428 and R-2394 is proposed. With the use of microcalorimetry and fluorescent probes, heat and the degree of membrane fluidity changes in the cells of the control culture were detected. These changes were manifested as an increase in the rate of protein synthesis, accompanied by the formation of heat and an elevated level of fluorescence of the NBD probe. All the three investigated compounds caused a diminution of the synthesis rate of membrane protein and heat production, and increased the level of fluorescence of the probe, which testified to cytotoxicity being a manifestation of the damage to the membrane structure. It is not excluded that the pesticides under study exert their cytotoxic action by damaging the membrane and disruption of the cytoskeleton of tumour cells. Damage to the cell membranes and a change in the cytoskeleton may be related to the disruptions in metabolic processes, a decrease in the rate of energy metabolism and the decrease in protein and DNA synthesis, which are observed during tumour cell incubation with the above-mentioned compounds.<EOD> Correction to: Developmental changes in functional connectivity are more variable in autism than in typical development\n\nC O R R E C T",

This increases risk of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.~LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance are present.~Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform noninvasive tests to measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.~This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAged 18 years or over\nParticipant willing and able to give informed consent.\nDocumented Ischaemic Heart Disease: either angio-graphically documented coronary artery disease or a previous history of myocardial infarction/angina.\nScreening echocardiography based diagnosis of LVH",

Currently, gene screening can be applied for the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, of which polymerase chain reaction-sequencing methods are widely used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new method for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of familial hypercholesterolemia based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Materials and Methods: Four familial hypercholesterolemia-affected families from two provinces were recruited via the PGD database. Ovarian matured oocytes were retrieved from patients and subjected to vitrification and warming. A rapid freeze-all strategy was used to freeze and thaw embryos. Embryos were fixed for chromosome analysis and then transferred to the microplate for PGD screening. Genomic DNA isolated from the patients' leukocytes, their partners, their embryos, and the oocytes was subjected to NGS library construction based on amplified whole exons of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. Results: Among the four selected cases, three resulted in positive findings for the familial hypercholesterolemia-affected embryos and one resulted in negative findings. All blastocysts of the negative cases underwent assisted hatching. We observed no blastocyst development and hatching ability of the negative cases. For the positive cases, seven patients achieved successful clinical pregnancies through the transfer of PGD-confirmed embryos with no familial hypercholesterolemia genetic defect.

Despite evidence that COVID-19 pandemic has decreased pet ownership and pet contact, its effect on attitudes towards the human-animal bond remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically review and synthetically appraise evidence on changes in public attitudes towards the human-animal bond during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest were searched for eligible studies published between 1 January 2020 and 29 February 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statements were used. Studies were screened, and quality was assessed using the QualSyst appraisal tool. Qualitative synthesis of findings was performed according to a standardized method described by Pluye and Goulet (2018).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNineteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Study quality was appraised as being good. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced attitudes towards the human-animal bond in different ways, including more dog ownership and human pet contact, greater fear of cross infection, and lower tolerance of dog behavior as a result of the pandemic. Fear of cross infection was mainly reported in studies using web surveys, whereas studies relying on social media for data obtained had no information about the sample's characteristics or data collection method. Differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human attitudes towards the human-animal bond as a result of changes in dog ownership, pet contact, cross infection fear and tolerance of dog behavior could not be demonstrated due to high heterogeneity among studies",

The main specific research questions were whether genetic factors could explain the familial aggregation of drinking behavior in middle-aged Finnish men and, second, whether alcohol dependence and alcohol-related problems are more strongly associated with each other than with individual or joint influence of genetic and non-shared environmental factors in this Finnish population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree thousand eight hundred nine Finnish families consisting of biological fathers and sons were screened for alcohol-related problems using the AUDIT (alcohol use disorders identification test) instrument. Genetic contributions to familial aggregation were estimated using biometric model-fitting analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the fathers (n = 3809) and sons (n = 3809) was 43 years (median = 42) and 22 years (median = 21) respectively. According to the genetic epidemiological findings, the mean number of problem drinking symptoms (DSM IV) of the fathers was 1.1 (95% confidence interval  = 0.9 to 1.3) symptoms. The genetic influence on drinking problems was, however, statistically non-significant. Environmental contribution to shared variance was substantial for AUDIT-A, while non-shared variance was large for AUDIT-C and for total AUDIT score. Intra-class correlations were modest (0.05-0.24).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetic contribution to AUDIT was rather small and it had no direct effect on alcohol-related problems. The high nonshared environmental variance for AUDIT-A (alcohol intake) indicates that alcohol consumption of biological fathers and sons is not likely to be correlated because of shared environmental risk factors. The results also suggest that there are large individual and family environmental differences in AUDIT-A (alcohol intake) and AUDIT-",

Use the following algorithm.  \nHere is a patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American women presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n\nNext, you should get the output of the trial-level eligibility for this clinical trial based only on the patient notes, including this patient note. You have to decide which factors (the inclusion criteria) will be sufficient to assess this one patient.  \nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presen to the ER with epis",

We have performed experiments using several known platelet agonists and platelet antagonists. This test accurately provides reproducible whole blood platelet aggregation results.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe evaluation of platelet function has been limited to platelet-poor plasma or platelet-rich plasm due to the laborious handling of platelets. In this study, we developed a novel method for whole blood aggregometry, a technique useful in clinical settings.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used an in vitro flow aggregometer system, combined with platelet rich plasma (PRP), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe novel technique resulted consistent and reproducible platelet aggregation readings. Although collagen and thrombin reproduced the results of platelet aggregometry in PRP, prostaglandin I2 showed lower platelet reactivity in whole blood, which suggests that other blood elements (e.g., red blood cells, thrombocytopenia, or plasma components) interfere with platelet aggregation. By using antiplatelet agents in the new system, we observed significant differences between low-dose ASA and cilostazol, and between high-dose ASA and apixaban.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo the best of our knowledge, we first achieved flow platelet aggregometry in whole blood. The use of whole blood can be useful for preclinical evaluations and the screening of new compounds in the future.<EOD> Correction to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\n\nCorrection to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\nPublished online: 18 November 2019Correction to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\nPublished online:",

        "output": "## Summary \nLet's summarize this tutorial about Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Prolog in Prolog works by breaking problems down into smaller pieces.\n\nThis tutorial is intended to introduce readers to the programming language of Prolog and how to solve problems in clinical NLP. There is a very good Prolog guidebook available at https://book.swi-prolog.org/structure/intro.html\n\nWhat is Prolog? \nProlog is also known as a logical language of programs and logic programming. It was invented by Alain Colmeret in 1970 in France and licensed in 1972 by Allen Newell and his research team under the name Logic Programming Systems, Inc. (LPS). It became very popular in computer science and AI as a logic programming language.\n\nWhat is Prolog in Prolog is a declarative language while other programming languages such as C++, C#, or Python are imperative programming languages. It is often said that Prolog is a declarative language because its statement explains the result rather than the way of achievement. In Prolog, a query is a logical form, usually represented in the form of a question. Here is a sample Prolog query, e.g., `?-Turtle is a frog`. This is similar to SQL's WHERE query. Prolog has the advantage of being able to retrieve results with only a query without any programming. It will return any answer that satisfies the query, not the only one that is expected. [/SUM]\n\n## Installing Prolog in the Linux System \nTo install the Prolog programming language (http://www.swi-prolog.org/), you need to install Swi-Prolog (http://www.swi-prolog.org/). This will require you to have already installed the GNU source distribution system and the Linux package management system.\n\nTo start the installation of Swi-Prolog, first go to the SwiProlog website (http://www.swi-prolog.org/). Then click the link to `Download source`. Swi-Prolog is open source and has an official repository. There are two versions available, including Swi-Prolog 6.0 and Swi-Prolog 5.6.

We would like to clarify that the purpose of the research was to evaluate the use of routine ultrasound scans for the study of the uteroplacental interface with regard to the presence of subplacental hypervascularity. Although a relationship between sub-chorionic hypervascularity and histological chorionic villi hypotrophy has been reported in previous research, this was not the reason for our research. Sub-chorionic hypervascularity (hypervascularity) is a frequent appearance on second trimester ultrasound and is related to feto-placental haemodynamics.\nFurthermore, as our research took place in the UK, we included only obstetric ultrasound scans between 18 and 24 weeks from pregnant women aged between 18 and 34 years old who were not suffering from any of the following conditions: any congenital illness, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac illness, renal problems, obesity (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ), blood group 0, or family history of inherited thrombophilia. We included women if they voluntarily signed informed consent to take part in the project.\nWe agree that the results of our research are valid, and for this reason we are grateful to those who raised this issue. Our results on a subgroup of 60 women should definitely be replicated in a wider study to confirm this association.\nI hope that you and your readers and readers will understand why we chose to refer to the results of the research as \"findings\" and not \"results\", because the results of our research were not able to show a statistically significant relationship with the appearance of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm labour, preterm delivery and pre-eclampsia.\nI would like to thank Dr Zampieri (and the other reviewers and the Editor in chief) for raising this point, which we consider very important, and we agree with these comments. I have now sent a revised manuscript entitled\" Sub-chorionic hypervascularity predicts the occurrence",

For example, to evaluate heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pupils size, skin color, etc.\n- Diagnostic tests; Diagnostic tests help the doctors to understand and confirm the diagnosis. Some common diagnostic tests may involve simple lab tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, etc.\n- Differential diagnosis; Once all the data gathered, the doctor should have a list of possible diseases that can affect the patient\u2019s condition. At this point, the doctor looks for possible answers with a method in which all other possible disease is eliminated by the current signs / symptoms and patient\u2019s medical record, and finally reaches a diagnosis based on the available evidence.\n- Treatment plan; The most important step, finally determines how much care patients should receive.\n- Conclusion statement and prognosis; The doctor concludes the visit based on his diagnostic workup, and explains the prognosis.\nThis page is the place for you to add the steps required in collecting data and making a diagnosis. You should complete this page as if you were a real doctor.

By employing the high-resolution fura-2 method, the effect of titanium on calcium-dependent activity of Saos-2 cells has been examined. Results show that exposure to titanium caused both a significant rise in basal intracellular calcium (Ca++) (p < 0.01) and a spike in i, indicating that such stimulation may alter the normal cytosolic biochemistry of osteoblasts in vitro and perhaps be involved in osteoblanic development. The two endothelial cells strains have also been investigated. Both titanium at 0.002%, 0.02% and 0.1% and calcium nitrate (CN; negative control) elicit a positive response in i, as measured by fura-2, of human endothelial cells (HUV EC) or a human umbilical vein endothelial cell strain (HMA 2.1). In contrast, human bone endothelial cells (HBM EC) exposed to titanium did not demonstrate a significant change in oi compared to control. There was, however a significant rise in oi when titanium was used in the presence of HEPES buffer, but not in Eagle's balanced salts or Ca-free buffers. It is suggested that the ability of endothelial cells to react may show differences, and that the effect of titanium may be related to ion buffering capabilities.<EOD> .\nThe authors evaluated the effectiveness of the combined therapy consisting of bifonazol, gliclazider, hydrophilic vasodil",

Ischemic damage is irreversible and is often unpredictable. Under ischemic damage conditions, cellular metabolic activities are depleted. In recent years, hysteretic mechanisms were explored to protect ischemic events, which included two major mechanisms including neuroprotective preconditioning of ischemia followed by ischemic tolerance or postconditioning protection. The most common pharmacological stimulus and/or ischemic conditioning for ischemic tolerance has been pharmacological postconditioning. Postconditioning is accomplished by several drug or ischemic insults that interrupt prolonged ischemia or reperfusion after ischemic/reperfusion injury followed by reperfusion (10). Ischemic tolerance has been defined as brief, repetitive cycles of ischemic/reperfusion, which can confer resistance to a subsequent severe prolonged ischemic insult. Ischemic pre-conditioning is defined as brief cycles of ischemic, which have been demonstrated to be protective against ischemic cellular injury in animal models and clinical evidence has not been established yet.<EOD> Intra\u2010arterial verapamil during transplantation\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to describe a strategy for the prevention of graft spasm after clinical liver transplantation that avoids the use of vasodilator medication.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFive consecutive adult patients underwent transplantation with intra-arterial infusion of verapamil (6-30 mg) during the anhepatic phase.

The use of a 7.5 MHz radial echoendoscope was first described in 1982 . Conventional EUS consists of an endoscope with two perpendicular balloon-mounted electronic transducers at the tip of the endoscope. More recently, a radial echoendoscope has also been marketed. These endoscopes provide a circumferential view of all layers of the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier to evaluate tumors at risk of malignancy. The echoendoscope is usually advanced through the working channel of a regular endoscope and can be used to acquire high-resolution images of the layers of the gastrointestinal tract, up to 15 cm from the endoscope transducer. With advances in computer technology, a new type of endosonographic imaging that uses a special dedicated endoscope is under development. <EOD> .\nThe review deals with some peculiarities of the functional status of blood system in patients with acute cerebral circulation disorders of vascular genesis.

While the apical bronchocentrics are in the stage of dissolution, the bronchiectasis remains in the same state. These bronchiectatic cavities are lined by thickened bronchial mucous membrane with a scantier layer of columnar and cubical cells. There is a slight exuda tion of lymphocytes in the serous mucosa between the cubical epithelial cells, the interstitial tissue is more abundant than in the apical involuted stage, and a certain number of granulocytes are present throughout.

This phenomenon is prevalent in perinatal brain damage, which also produces an impaired oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation. C1qTNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1) is implicated in promoting cell survival during cell stress. We therefore studied whether CTRP1 also promotes OL precursor (OP) cell survival under low oxygen tension, which may be important for their survival in the early stages of brain development and for their maturation during their migration. Our study revealed that 1) OL lineage cells upregulate CTRP1 expression in response to hypoxia in vitro; 2) recombinant human (rh) CTRP1 was able to protect OPs from oxidative stress; and 3) rh CTRP1 promoted OP survival under oxygen deprivation by reducing cell death and by arresting cell cycle. These data reveal the potential of CTRP1 to mediate oxidative stress, thus contributing to the survival of OPs under low oxygen tension, which is a necessary condition to be involved in the maturation of these cells.<EOD> The role of surgery and radiation therapy in the treatment of mucous membrane pemphigoid: Review of the literature\n\nBackground: Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a rare, immunemediated mucosal disorder, and its clinical presentation can be variable.

All the examinees received different regimens of insulin therapy. The basal serum level of C-peptide in the patients was decreased 77% in relation to control and the basal insulin excretion in patients with IDD was 2.5-fold reduced. The secretion of immunoreactive C-peptide rose during oral tolerance test in response to carbohydrate loading but diminished in 8 patients within 24 hrs after intravenous glucose load test. Injection of tolbutamide (250 mg) induced hyperglycemia and reduced serum C-peptide levels in insulin dependent diabetics. In 7 of patients with IDD, serum C-peptide level diminished after administration of insulin, while in 6 examinees the concentrations of C-peptide remained unchanged during insulin injection. In the patients treated with intermediate acting insulin no relation between C-peptide and insulin levels in fasting state was seen. These data seem to indicate that disturbances in insulin secretion have polyetiological genesis. A long-term glucose loading test, a 24-hr serum C-peptide assay and immunoreactive C-peptide measurements during insulin administration are recommended for evaluation of insulin production in diabetics, as well as for differential diagnosis of IDD and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<EOD> Numerical Prediction of Tear Resistance of Bio-Based Bio-Poly(P",

Patients with diabetes are 22 times more likely to have foot ulceration or gangrene than nondiabetics, while foot ulceration precedes 85% of lower-extremity amputation. Three factors combine to promote tissue necrosis in diabetic feet: ischemia, neuropathy, and trauma. Among them, ischemia peripheral arterial disease may play the important roles in the development of DFU. Moreover, diffuse vascular disease is the main characteristics, and thus it becomes difficult for treatment by using arterial bypass or balloon angioplasty. Therefore, we hypothesized that continuous arterial thrombolysis may be an effective therapy in diabetic foot. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of continuous intra-femoral artery injection of urokinase by micro-artery-pump in diabetic ulcers.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\ndiabetic foot ulcer\n< = 80 years old\ndiabetic foot ulcer stage 2-4\nIschemic necrosis with ischemic area> 1/3 in both front and rear of foot\n\nFinally, you should always repeat trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly",

Although pigs are frequently raised as companion animals by humans, they are primarily farm animals. The domestication of pigs about 8,000 years ago has been accompanied by selection of breeds for size, feed conversation, and meat and fat production. Pig is a common domestic animal in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere and as such they are frequently exposed to human pathogens and human-introduced tumour agents, especially cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma caused by the human papilloma virus. As a result, a variety of pig cancers have been reported in the past five decades. However, the pig is still a rare animal to present to the medical oncologist! This paper reviews the literature on pig neoplasms in English language journals from 1958 to 2006 (i.e., 49 years). It summarizes the incidence of neoplasms found in domestic pigs including those in the wild as well as the more exotic miniature swine species. It also provides a discussion of recent developments in molecular pathogenesis of tumorigenesis in these animals. Aspects include the molecular characteristics of pig cancer biology and the utility of the domestic pig as a model for human cancer and to test new therapeutic drugs and devices. The use of immune-competent pigs to test new cancer vaccines is briefly reviewed.\nIt has been 50 years since the first pig neoplasms 1 and 40 years since the first genetic neoplasia in pigs was reported 2 in the English language literature. Although most of these reports are rather dated, a number of cases of pig neoplasms are still found today",

Many individuals with established NASH can be identified at an early stage and treated according to the current evidence-based recommendations. As the majority of such patients will not proceed to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, several ongoing efforts are directed towards development of specific pharmacodynamic therapies targeting the underlying fatty liver pathogenesis. A key pathway affected by metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes is the bile acid (BA) signaling, orchestrated by the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and the activation of BA transport protein OATP1B1 in the liver. Indeed, elevated BA concentrations in serum (e.g., induced by increased hepatic synthesis of primary BAs, diminished hepatic uptake of secondary BAs or increased enterohepatic BA circulation) have been suggested to be causative in the initiation and perpetuation of NASH progression. It is interesting to note that mice with combined FXR- and ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) deficiency, i.e., the combined reduction of these pathways, developed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as early as 4 weeks of age. Intriguingly, liver lipids in this model could be reversed by feeding of high-fat diet with cholic acid instead of cholate, while hepatic inflammation and fibrosis were not attenuated, as observed in a previous experimental model. In addition, a combined FXR- and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19)-deficient transgenic mouse resulted in more pronounced hepatic steatosis than the individual deficits per se. Hepatocytes with BA-induced lipotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis were less responsive to FGF19 ther",

Studies of language switching in simultaneous interpreters are still lacking, particularly from the perspective of eye-tracking technology. In this study, bilingual Mandarin speakers who have also completed intensive interpreting training were recruited and instructed to speak in either their native language (A1) or their second language (L2), while their eye movements were recorded using a Tobii TX300. After data preprocessing and cleaning, a total of 448 sets of data were obtained. Three experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between switching costs (1) of the direction of language and switch type, (2) between the direction of language and switch type, and (3) switch type, respectively. The results showed that both the direction of language and switch type had an effect on the switching costs. The eye movement data revealed a significant difference in gazing time and fixation counts between languages, indicating that when interpreters switched from L2 to A1, they needed significantly more cognitive resources. Moreover, the switch type, i.e., backward or forward, had a marked effect on switch costs. In the backward condition, a larger switch cost occurred, and interpreters spent more time reading the target sentence to extract information and process it. These findings have implications for theory construction and provide further insight into the process and characteristics of language switching in simultaneous interpreters using eye-tracking technology.\n\n## Research motivation\nResearching the mechanism underlying language switching in simultaneous interpreters is of great scientific importance. This study addressed the questions of whether language switching impacted switch speed, cognitive processing, and memory in L2, and whether there was a cognitive",

The prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome was higher in females than that in males for T2DM patients in this study; however, the data revealed that metabolic syndrome were more prevalent in males than in females among the T2DM without macroalbuminuria and without PAD. There are some confounders such as aging and gender to explain these inconsistent data. Some studies demonstrated that males generally exhibit higher levels of insulin resistance, while females demonstrate higher levels of insulin sensitivity. These studies hypothesize that this trend may be due to the protective effects of female sex in T2DM patients. There were significantly higher insulin levels and HOMA-IR in males than in females in the three groups of T2DM patients in this study. The mean HOMA-IR level was higher in females than the levels in males among the T2DM patients without macroalbuminuria and without PAD, but there were no significant differences in HOMA-IR levels in the three groups of T2DM patients. The level of serum insulin indicates the degree of insulin resistance. The insulin levels and HOMA-IR levels did not show any sexrelated differences in T2DM patients in three groups with macroalbuminuria PAD or without macroalbuminuria and without PAD. The higher HOMA-IR levels in males than in females in three groups of T2DM patients in this study imply that the males with T2DM are more insulin resistant than their female counterparts. These results suggest that insulin resistance may be a potential cardio-protective risk factor in male adults.\n\n## Effect of epa on vascular stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes: a feasibility study\nChien-Yu Chen, 1 Chih-Chung Hsieh,",

Data about the correlation between BNP and congestive acute heart failure (AHF) are lacking. Therefore, it was our primary aim to study relations between BNP and severity of AHF. Moreover, we intended to search for correlations between BNP, serum potassium (K), and blood glucose (BG), and to evaluate the value of BNP as a marker for clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic remission at discharge.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 77 CHF patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were strong correlations between BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (rho=0.83, p<0.0001), and BNP and left ventricular (LV) mass index (r=0.58, p<0.0001). BNP correlated more favorably with LVEF and LV mass index in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) than in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. The mean BNP levels were higher in NYHA IV than in NYHA II/III patients. BNP correlated with serum creatinine (r=0.349, p=0.004). BNP levels decreased in 64 patients. The decrease was not statistically more marked in ischemic patients (ICM), probably due to the higher mortality (ICM 21%, DCM 9%. BNP levels were higher in patients with lower K levels and lower in patients with lower BG levels. BNP was positively correlated with C-reactive protein (r=0.295, p=0.008) and left ventricular diastolic pressure (r=0.272, p=0.012). The remission of some parameters was more obvious in NYHA I/II than in NYHA III(",

Therefore, we may conclude that valproic acid affects histones indirectly through HDACi.\n\n##### Reference\nKawada, A., Watanabe, K., Murata, S., Nakazawa, B., Ishiyama, R., Kobayashi, H., Yonemoto, Y., Yamanaka, O., Shimada, K., & Onozato, M.

Cancer research, 65(5), 1625-31.\n\n\n### Answer 3\nThe first treatment option for breast cancer patients is surgery. The choice of surgical method is determined by many factors. Therefore, surgery is performed by taking into account all these conditions. For example, axillary lymph node dissection must be performed for patients with clinical node positive breast cancer. Radiation therapy is used to prevent recurrence of the cancer and to reduce the risk of developing a second primary cancer. Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, in which cytotoxic drugs are given to shrink the tumor size before surgery, is also widely used with patients with large breast tumors that are more likely to cause serious problems if left untreated. Endocrine therapy is recommended in patients with oestrogen positive (ER+ ) and/or progesterone positive (PR+ ) tumours, except for those who have breast cancer that is triple negative or HER2 positive. Targeted drug therapy is recommended only when the cancer has HER2 amplification. Targeted therapies interfere with specific proteins (such as HER",

PV anatomy and pulmonary vein (PV) flow patterns have recently been reported as predictors of PV stenosis. Here we aimed to quantify PV flow and assess the use of pre-PVI pulmonary artery peak diastolic gradients to predict post-PVI PV flow patterns. Methods Fifty-eight patients undergoing PVI were prospectively recruited. Each patient had pre-pulmonary vein (PV) and pre-ablation (postpulmonary vein isolation; PVI) pulmonary artery peak diastolic gradients obtained. Doppler flow assessment and peak diastolic gradients immediately distal to the isolated and unablated PVs within 2 months of the procedure were evaluated. Results A total of 57 patients were recruited who had pre-PV and pre-PVI flow assessments. Mean diastolic gradients pre-PV (11.4 mm Hg) were lower than post-PVI gradients (16.2 mm Hg) and lower than pre-PVI assessments in patients who developed occluded flow patterns (23.3 mm Hg). There was no relationship between post-PVI Doppler parameters and pre-PVI pulmonary artery gradients. Conclusions This is the first data set to quantify pre-PVI Doppler flow parameters. The assessment of PV flow may allow PVI to be used to predict which PVs will lose flow post PVI. In cases where diastolic gradients are abnormally high PV stenting may be indicated and/or a careful reassessment should take place prior to PVI.<EOD> Phase I, Isobolographic, and Biologic Study of a High Antigen Dose of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin in a Murine Model of Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis\nPurpose: To evaluate the safety",

We observed melanocytic nevus (MN) using digital dermoscopic images and demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel mechanistic design approach for sunscreens to overcome the inherent difficulty for sunscreens to adhere to the skin. The skin was divided into four quadrants (Qs), and the average skin-adherent degree (SAD) of sunscreens, that is, the average ratio of sunscreen area on a quadrant after washing to before washing, was evaluated with a formula we developed using digital dermoscopic images of MN. As the SAD reflects the amount of skin-adherent sunscreen, the higher the SAD, the better the sunscreen adhesion. In all ten subjects, we found no significant differences in SAD between Q1 and Q2 to obtain an adequate amount of sunscreen even in the skin on which sunscreen was difficult to adhere. The novel mechanistic design approach will aid in the development of sunscreens with good adherence to the skin.<EOD> .\nThe content of serum albumins in 94 children with various renal diseases was measured by the quantitative immunodiffusion method with antianalbumins of different specificities.

You are an underground call center worker and you are required to answer 1000 calls a day. When people call you, your task is to determine on average how long will it take to respond to an individual call and then you have to estimate call duration. If not, you will receive deduction. The call duration is calculated by considering multiple variables. In order for you to improve your performance, let's predict some of these variables that have the highest contributions to the phone calls.\n\nLet's think the following variables:\n- Phone number\n- Calls from mobile\n- Answered by the same agent\n- Calls from women\n- Calls made on non-work days\n- Calls concerning non-medical\n- Agent's experience level\n- Calls made with English language - Agent's language proficiency\n- Agent's call center experience\n\nWe will try to estimate the call duration variables by learning the best features. Here is the process:\n\n- We formulate our learning question as a regressor model with the target variable _Call duration_. You can specify the dataset in the cell under the variable call duration, e.g., call_duration: 'calls'.\n- We define the dependent variable and the target column in the cells of call duration, e.g., call_duration: 'calls duration', call_duration_target: 'calls duration target'.\n- The model parameters are set as follows:\n  - We will use Logit regression with the call duration variable 'calls'.\n  - We assume that the model with parameters _Calls_ will have the best accuracy. That is, we are training 3 models: Ridge regression, Lasso, and Elasticnet models with _Calls_ parameter.\n\nThe following cells under the variable [Ridge regression], [Lasso regression], and [ElasticNet regression] show the results:\n- We need to compare the effectiveness of three models using the RMSE and R2 scores of those models, e.g., elasticNet: 'RMSE', elasticNet: 'R2', lasso: 'RMSE', lasso: 'R2', ridge: 'RMSE', ridge:",

We measure the cross-entropy loss over the labels `1: Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; 2: Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.` and the prediction probabilities of the network. For a particular epoch, the overall cross-entropy loss L CE on the whole dataset `D` is calculated by:\n \n    \\[L CE = 1 |D| \\sum _{c \\in D} \\log( p_s^{c})\\]\nwhere ${p}_s$ is the scale of the patient for the assessment of eligibility to the clinical trial. The prediction output of the network is a discrete distribution, and usually it is in the form of a vector in the range of 0 to 1. In this case, the calculation of the loss function is to logarithmize the distribution and find its expectation value. And since the summation operation tends to overestimate the weight for a certain data point in the same label, we use a weighted cross-entropy form to alleviate that.\n\nNow, we calculate the loss over the whole dataset, we show the cross-entropy loss on the validation set when using different settings of the trial-level eligibility loss. We can see a continuous decrease of loss when adding the trial-level eligibility loss. So we want to continue training the network until it reaches the bottom.\n\n![Evaluate-loss](./img/Evaluate-loss.png)\n\n```{note}\n\tNote: The loss is the cross-entropy loss on the validation set, and the training is done as usual.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the following electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, Scopus, Social Services Abstracts, Google Scholar, and Dissertations Abstract International Theses. Results: Thirteen peer-reviewed journals articles were included in the systematic review. A variety of oral health conditions were considered as dependent variables but the number of studies evaluating each specific disease or condition was limited. Evaluations of specific diseases with limited evidence for adolescents in the United States included gingivitis, dental caries, periodontal disease, and traumatic dental injury (TDI). Discussion: Although dental caries and TDI were reported to be more prevalent among adolescents compared to adults, there was less evidence on the impact of oral health on oral health-related quality of life among adolescents compared to adults. There is an urgent need for longitudinal studies with a prospective design and large sample that could examine the impact of specific dental conditions on different aspects of oral health-related quality of life.\n\n# Background\nThe concept of oral health was defined by the United Kingdom's National Health Service in 2003 as, \"a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" . In 2004, the World Health organization (WHO) followed suit, by defining oral health as the, \"absence of disease or disorder, injury or impairment including pain of oral or paraoral structures, as well as problems relating to personal oral hygiene, and esthetics affecting psychological wellbeing. It also refers to conditions of periodontium i.e. supporting structures of teeth, and their relationship with other structures\" in the definition of oral health.

In the other series bacterial cultures of the entire suction-tip surfaces were made by inserting an agar tip onto the entire surface, allowing the swab to absorb the bacteria and then cutting the portion of the swab with the agar tip on the surface. In 21 samples (95 per cent confidence interval 21 to 31 per cent) suction tips contaminated with S aureus were found by the rinse method and 100 per cent of tips were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli by the agar swab method.

Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy from 2003 to 2017 at 11 hospitals in South Korea were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Data from 220 patients were included; 63.7% of all patients had lung metastases, 14.5% had pleural dissemination, 46.6% had more than 3 metastatic foci, and 9.2% had pleural-only metastases. The median total tumor size was 4.2 cm (interquartile range, 1.2\u221211.1). In the thoracic metastasis group, the median survival time was 87 months (interquartile range, 67.6\u2212106.3) in patients with larger intrathoracic total tumor size (2.7 cm vs. 3.9 cm); the median survival time was significantly longer in the small-tumor group (\u22643.9 cm).

Crosstalk between Microbiota and Immune Cells: Significance for the Pathology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\n# Introduction\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract of multifactorial aetiology. Specifically, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue destruction in the intestine. IBD can arise after an inappropriate immune response to the commensal microbiota and is sustained by complex interactions between the external (environment) and internal (host) factors.\nTraditionally, a predisposing or protective role has been attributed to the environmental risk factors, however, recent studies have shed light on the important role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Notably, IBD patients have been characterized by a profound dysbiosis and an impairment in the commensal microbiota of the colonic mucosa. Gut microbiota is considered a key player in regulating immunological health because it maintains a fine balance between host-harmful and host-friendly microbes by shaping the host immune activity. Indeed, a large proportion of the body's immune system is found in the intestine, where it interacts with the microbiota present in the lumen. Thus, the maintenance and regulation of the intestinal ecosystem require the continuous dialogue of the host immune system with the microbiota.\nAlthough most IBD subtypes present an autoimmune phenotype, an increasing body of evidence is supporting the role of",

In other words, you want to provide some way to score the clinical trial using data contained in your \"patient note\".\nFrom What you provide, I believe to be the problem. You are wanting to be able to use the patient's age and the type of cancer to evaluate the trial. The patient's age and cancer should be easy to determine for most people, but the reason you are receiving a \"Not A-1\" is because your data entry is not accurate. You are not specifying the type of cancer in the patient \"note\" so you cannot evaluate it properly. One way to accomplish this could be to create and populate a clinicaltrials table to store patient eligibility related information. This information can then be used to score the trial-level eligibility and give a final score for each trial that you have available.\nWhat I would suggest, however, is to create a new table or create a new column in the clinicaltrials table to store the type of cancer.

In addition, based on your results, you are required to suggest a data-driven recommendation system for identifying ART nonadherence, which can be a valuable auxiliary tool for the doctors to reduce medical costs and ensure patients' health conditions. The region where you are currently working is a resource-poor part of China. Here is the patient registry from a local AIDS epicenter in Liaoning.\n\nThe data set includes three subsets: demographic features, treatment-related features, and symptom profiles. The goal of the analysis is to predict adherence to ART among HIV-positive people in this region. Patients who adhered to ART were identified by whether ART was present in the patient's medical record, and patients who did not adhered to ART were those whose ART was absent in the medical record. Patients had either a binary adherence-status (0/1 if ART was present) when the trial ended, or a right-censored observation (0/0 by default) meaning that we do not know whether they would adhere to treatment. The ART prescription, or the set of ART medicines, including at least 3 ART drugs, such as AZT, DDC, and NVP, was assigned to the treatment drug group and the ART regimen groups include the treatment drug and the symptom profiles within 30 days of HIV-positive diagnosis.\n\nYou are expected to conduct a systematic comparison and explain which features are informative to assess if patients adhere to HIV antiretroviral drug therapy. Consider features such as age, gender, symptoms, and ART regimen. Since we have both missing and right-censored outcomes, you can apply statistical",

Transdermal nitrate has gained widespread use following the development of nitrates by which the rate of elimination of active drug is reduced and side\u2010effects are minimised.

If using indexing, Python requires that you specify the size of the list with a positive integer. The first element of a list is `lis[0]`, the last element is `lis[-1]`.\n    * If you want to access the element in the middle of a list, like `lis[1]`, you can do a loop with an iterator index that starts at zero.\n    * Tuples do contain arbitrary objects like lists, and can be created using the `tuple()` constructor, e.g., `tu=tuple(\"Hello\", \"World\")`.\n    * Tuples support iterators, e.g., `x for varnames, vals in tu: print (varnames, val)`. \n    * It supports several methods including slice, subscript, or indexing to help the user to look inside its structure.\n    * It is not mutable.\n    ```python\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    from datetime import datetime\n    2 list\n    2 tuple\n    2 dicts\n    3 tuple-iterator\n    3 dataframe\n    3 dictionary\n    \n                        # Python 3\n                    print (\n                        \"hello\",\n                        \"world !\",\n                        end=\" \",\n                        sep=\"\\n\"\n                    )\n                    # Python 2\n                    print (\n                        \"Hello, \\tWorld! \\n\"\n                    )\n    ```\n\n* What",

Since little is known about immunological mechanisms, present study examines correlations between SIBO and immunoreactants. Materials and methods: This investigation took place at Taleghani Hospital, affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Serum samples of 35 UC patients and 16 healthy age-and sex-matched controls were examined to detect SIBO by means of the glucose hydrogen test. Serum IgG and IgM levels, as well as serum interleukin-6, were evaluated in patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: SIBO is more common in patients (20%) than in controls (7%). This bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is associated with higher level serum IgG (p=0.04) and IgM (p=0.003), but not serum interleukin-6. Conclusions: SIBO in patients can be a risk factor for immunoglobulin synthesis and overweight.\n\n# Introduction\nThe overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine was described by [bib_ref]  Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: diagnosis and treatment, Gasche [/bib_ref]  as a heterogeneous gastrointestinal disorder including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, characterized by increase in number and types of bacteria exceeding the norm of the gut.

Methods:Recent-drinkers were female emergency department attendees for whom recent alcohol and marijuana use was documented. Cut-off scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and Alcohol Smoking and Drinking with Drug Use Screening Test were used to identify frequent drinkers. Logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship of alcohol and SH use with injury. Results:Among 640 women, 199 (31.1%) reported drinking within the last 2 weeks and were included in the alcohol analyses. Overall, 29.1% reported drinking 2-7 drinks/week and 36.9% reported drinking 8+ drinks/week. The mean \u00b1 SD number of drinks consumed daily was 1.6 (95% confidence interval , 1.0, 2.2). The mean \u00b1 SD amount of SH pills/week was 8.7 (95% CI, 6.9, 10.4). The combination of alcohol use (8+ drinks/week) and SH medication use was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for injury of 2.64 (95% CI, 0.79, 8.43). The number of SH medication use days was also increased (OR = 2.22, 95% CI, 1.64, 2.89) but in the absence of alcohol use. In contrast the number of heavy drinking days was not related to injury. Conclusions:Combination of SH and alcohol use was related to injury while SH use alone was not. This finding may indicate increased risk of adverse consequences of alcohol among women who use SH medication, particularly when SH is not prescribed for treatment of alcohol addiction.<EOD> Effect of gastric surgery on serum pepsinogen levels in",

We have investigated the role of changes in oxygen supply on cell proliferation and maturation during regrowth of the ventral prostate by measuring the relative oxygen levels in the tissue at various time points using luminometry, and comparing them with changes in cell proliferation determined by autoradiography and histological assessments of cell differentiation. After short\u2010term exposure to the androgen, a temporary reduction has been observed in 02 supply despite an increase in blood flow. This is suggested to be due to an in situ vasoconstriction induced by an increase in nitric oxide after androgen administration. An uncoupling between blood flow and oxygen supply is evidenced by a concomitant blood oxygen decrement. Cell proliferation was transitorily induced by androgen as evidenced by an early and robust response, although it did not increase linearly over the studied period of 14 days. We show that the transient oxygen shortage that occurs during androgen administration inhibits cell proliferation and maturation. Consequently, a transit\u2010phase, during which cell proliferation is stimulated, can be followed by a phase in which",

The aim of the present work was to correlate this phenomenon with a specific functional variation in cerebellar lobules (anterior and posterior) by the evaluation of nitric oxide (NO) pathway activation. NO and cGMP levels after lesion are different in the two parts of the cerebellum, with the most evident NO increase in the anterior lobe and cGMP decrease in the damaged ipsi\u2010lateral posterior lobe. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnOc) and cyclic GMP\u2010mediated protein kinase (PKG) mRNA are more expressed in the posterior lobe, whereas NO level in the tissue increases after lesion. In both parts of the cerebellum, c\u2010fos mRNA and Fos protein\u2010like expression levels increase after lesion. The increase in c\u2010fos expression, detected in both lobes by in situ hybridization and Western blot, is greater in the anterior lobe. The results suggest an active role of NO during the cerebrocortical lesion, probably through regulation of nNOS, cyclic GMP, and/or Fos protein expression.<EOD> Characteristics and outcomes of women with obstetric fistula in four countries.\nUNLABELLED\nTHE AIM of the study was to describe the characteristics of women with obstetric fistula and determine outcomes after surgical repair.

The results show that there have been significant increases in referral of patients, the number of radiographic examinations and surgical interventions, but a decrease in the length of stay in hospital. Further, there appear to have been regional variations in management patterns, with special pleural clinics and surgical specialties being more widely employed in London than in the North or in Birmingham.<EOD> SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO3a and mediates its transcriptional activation in response to oxidative stress.\nSIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that is activated by cellular stress, metabolic insults, calorie restriction, and resveratrol. We observed that SIRT1 deacetylated a tumor suppressor and transcription factor, FOXO3a, in vitro. Overexpression of SIRT1 markedly attenuated oxidative stress-induced hyperacetylation and reduced FOXO3a binding to its response promoter elements. Furthermore, SIRT1 deacetylated endogenous FOXO3a in response to oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. The effects of SIRT1 on FOXO3a acetylation and FOXO3a-mediated transcription were abolished after lysine 64 mimics substitution. SIRT1 mediates the deacetylation of FOXO3a in vitro through interaction with its highly conserved N-terminal nuclear localization sequence motif. These observations indicate that SIRT1 may directly or indirectly affect the phosphorylation status of FOXO3a.<EOD> Effect of interleukin-10 promoter polymorphism on risk of tuberculosis in HLA DR2+ patients with diabetes mellitus\nAbstract Diabetes is a recognised risk factor for tuberculosis.

MethodsaaA total of 151 adults with ASD participated in this study. All subjects completed the demographic questionnaire, sexual functional checklist, 24-item HRQOL scale, depression anxiety stress scale, and Wender Utah rating scale. They also gave blood samples for thyroid function tests and a urine sample to test for antibodies against human gonadotropin related antigens. All items were evaluated separately and the data from these assessments were analyzed. ResultsaaMale subjects with ASD and hyperthyroidism or autoimmunity to gonadotropin hormones reported more negative sexual function compared to male subjects with ASD and intact hormones. Male subjects with comorbid hypothyroidism reported poorer HRQOL. No significant differences were observed in female subjects. ConclusionaaThe results of the present study indicate that clinicians should be aware of physical comorbidities and hormones disturbances and of the associations with sexual functions and HRQOL in adults with ASD.\n\n# Introduction\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social interaction deficits, difficulties with communication, and stereotyped and repetitive behavior.

Treatment with Amphotericin B intravenously (IV) followed by Candicillin G (IV) failed to improve their general condition. Therefore, in case no. 2 of leukocytopenia, adrenalectomy was performed before the second course of antifungal therapy. Five days later, in case no. 2, there was normalization of hemoglobin and white cell count and improvement of temperature. In case 3, adrenalectomy was performed immediately before the second course of antifungal therapy. This resulted in fever reduction and improvement of hemoglobin and white cell counts.

Cytogenetic abnormalities are detected in the majority of the patients and occur as unipolar and bipolar chromosomal aberrations. These cytogenetic abnormalities have not been systematically studied as a prognostic factor and their role in the prognosis is not well defined. For this evaluation, we analyzed the data of patients with CMML from two prospective multicenter trials. Patients on the trials underwent regular cytogenetic evaluation at diagnosis and were followed for survival and disease progression. We evaluated the effect of cytogenetic factors at the time of diagnosis: complexity of cytogenetic abnormality, blast excess, and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Over a median follow-up period of 15 months, 38% of patients transformed to AML. Patients with complex karyotype at diagnosis had lower probability of transformation to AML compared with patients with normal cytogenetics (P = 0.0258). There was no significant association between a complex cytogenetic profile and overall survival or cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation. A blast excess of 5% at baseline was also associated with a lower incidence of transformation to AML, but this observation did not survive correction for multiple testing (P = 0.0361) and did not improve other models of predicting leukemic transformation. Multivariate analysis showed that, in addition to the complex cytogenetic profile, there was an association between transfusion dependence and incidence of transformation to AML. Our findings suggest that patients with CMML with a predominance of monocytic precursors and normal cytogenetics at diagnosis have a lower probability to",

Smoking can cause numerous pathological changes, which can alter the therapeutic effect of antibiotic treatment as well. The objective of this study was to investigate whether cigarette smoking modulates antibiotic resistance in an in vivo mouse model of bacterial skin infection, and to analyze whether smoke exposure influences the kinetics and efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. Using Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa mouse skin infection models, we assessed whether passive smoking, during active treatment with cefazolin or tobramycin, reduced in vivo pharmacological activity of such antibiotics. Cigarette smoke exposure did not influence in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to cefazolin and tobramycin. Moreover, smoking-exposed mice displayed reduced S. pyogenes skin infection and were more susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection. Our findings show that cigarette smoke exposure causes a significant reduction in S. pyogenes infection as well as delayed wound healing, while promoting P. aeruginosa infection.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NOARG on the expression of HSP27 and HSP60 in Wistar rat kidneys. Bilateral renal artery occlusion (BRAO), lasting 5 min, was followed by 60 min of resuscitation. L-NOARG was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before BRAO. Animals were killed after 30 min reperfusion following BRAO, and immunostaining and Western blot were applied to evaluate the effect of endogenous NO on renal HSP27 and HSP60 expression. In control rats, HSP27 was expressed in the epithelial cells and HSP60 in the nucleus of the tubular epithelium. BRAO led to the loss of HSP60 and HSP27 expression. L-NOARG prior to BRAO suppressed HSP27 expression in the kidney when compared to the other experimental groups, but had no influence on HSP60 expression. In conclusion, endogenous NO synthase inhibition with l-NOARG resulted in the suppression of HSP27 expression in rat kidney.<EOD> Association of maternal depressive symptoms with the initiation of antenatal anxiety or depression in the first trimester and their relation with low birth weight in a population of Chinese women in Tianjin, China, 2011-2012.\nBACKGROUND\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the association of maternal depressive symptoms with the initiation of antenatal psychological anxiety and depressive disorders in the first trimester in a Chinese pregnant population and to explore the adverse effect of maternal psychological distress",

        "output": "<EOD> Effects of Catheter Size and Proximity on Spatial Distribution and Efficiency of Vascular Convection-Enhanced Delivery.\nConvection-enhanced delivery (CED) is an infusion method whereby solutions are slowly infused into the brain through small catheters to enhance the efficacy of drug delivery while minimizing drug exposure to the systemic circulation. Recent studies have shown that placement of multiple infusion catheters adjacent to one another has a limited adverse effect on drug efficacy while more than doubling infusion rates. To date, the optimal spacing between infusion catheters has not been assessed. Further, because of the large surface area of the brain and the need for a large surface area catheter (e.g. 3 mm diameter) for infusion in humans, it is unclear if the increase in infusion rates seen with the placement of multiple catheters will be sufficient for clinical infusion, especially for delivery of large molecules. We therefore evaluated the effect of catheter diameter, number, and spacing of catheters on the distribution and efficiency of drug infusion by quantifying drug concentration profiles in rat brain after CED delivery of either fluorescent dye or 125I-labeled human serum albumin (HSA). We find that increasing catheter number at constant catheter spacing improves the efficiency of distribution along the length of the catheter but only results in a modest increase in overall distribution due to the loss of distribution efficacy at the distal end of the catheter. Furthermore, although the increased infusion rates permitted by the placement of multiple catheters results in more rapid drug delivery out of the catheter into the brain and a more complete distribution of drug throughout the catheter surface, the increase in drug infusion rates is insufficient for delivery of 125I-labeled HSA, a large conjugate of HSA labeled with an iodine-125 isotype.<EOD> .\nThe results of intracorneal implantation of calcium phosphate (Ca-P) ceramics as experimental models for keratoprostheses in rabbits were presented.

In this review, we focus mainly on recent advances in epigenetics in plants caused by abiotic stresses, and further discuss how epigenetics may affect plant biotic stress responses. By means of chromatin modifications and interplays, epigenetic mechanisms dynamically regulate gene expression, thus participating in plant development and stress responses. Epigenetic inheritance could be an important factor for plants to adapt in a changing environment. Although the complexity in plant epigenomes still poses huge challenges for investigators to decipher the whole picture, our improved understanding of plant chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms should help to tackle current practical questions in agriculture, including drought tolerance.<EOD> A case of non-metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nA 53-year old male with a history of tobacco chewing presented to the surgical oncology unit with weight loss, pain in the neck and a difficulty in swallowing. Oesophagoscopy showed a large fungating bulky tumour measuring 10x5 cm, which was a moderately differentiated mucosal squamous cell cancer extending for 6 cm. A crossover biopsy gave a diagnosis of squamous cell cancer with positive surgical margins. The patient was treated with three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The patient was disease-free with no evidence of metastases at 6 months of postsurgery, and had only a mild side effect of nausea which did not require any treatment. This case highlights how neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used to shrink the tumour, and is therefore an effective method of inducing a response to cancer.<EOD> .\nUNLABELLED\nLung nodules, especially those less than 1 cm in diameter, are difficult to identify, particularly on chest radiography.

Gastric mucosal damage was produced with indomethacin in rats using a standardized in vivo test measuring gastric damage, including quantitative histological assessment. The compounds were administered orally with doses of 1-20 mg/kg, and the histological analysis of tissue samples was performed blind, in random order, evaluating gastric parietal, lamina propria, submucosal and muscular tissues. Both compounds tested showed ability to inhibit gastric damage. Omeprazole produced a higher inhibition both on tissue levels (p = 0.0049, ANOVA) and on gastric damage (p = 0.001, t-test) than ranitidine. Histological findings corroborated these results. These findings suggest that omeprazole may have a different ability to protect the gastric mucosa than ranitidine.<EOD> Cytologic-histologic correlation of pulmonary fine-needle biopsies.\nTwenty-four human specimens were obtained from patients who had lung nodules diagnosed cytologically.

Vascular rings from small mesenteric arteries were obtained from 14 patients with congestive heart failure and 12 normal subjects. Contractions were measured after endothelium removal (precontraction with norepinephrine ) and after treatment with ET-1 (10(-10) and 10(-9) M), in the presence of different blockers (sarafotoxin 6c, FR 139317, BQ-123, BQ-788, and BQ-610). ET-1-induced contraction increased when contraction had previously been triggered by NE, and sarafotoxin 6c (an ETB-receptor antagonist), FR-139317 (a ETA-receptor antagonist), and BQ-788 (an ETB-receptor antagonist) inhibited this effect. Additionally, the ET-1-induced contraction in the presence of NE-induced precontraction was lower in patients than controls, mainly due to the higher effect of FR-139317. It is concluded that ET-1 induced arterial contraction is mediated by both ETA and ETB subtypes, and that there is a greater contribution of the ETB subtype in patients than in controls.<EOD> Disseminated coccidioidomycosis in an Ectomys fuscus\nAn Ectomys fuscus had severe coccidioidal histoplasmosis infection.

For problem `1` and `2`, you need to construct a new recurrent neural network structure that uses the input signal to make decision when encountering new data. For problem `3`, we will use our designed attention model in `2.1.1` to solve it.\n\n## Problem `1`:\nWhen given a patient note, the task is to make a decision using the clinical trial.\n\nThe input to the network includes the patient note, the clinical trial and the labels. Thus, we construct a 3-layer Multi-Head Self-Attention layer to generate the attention vectors for each node in the patient note and the labels of a trial. It is a composition of a Multi-Head Self-Attention layer and a Concatenate layer, which will be used as an intermediate unit, which is shown in Figure 1. The first Multi-Head Self-Attention layer is an [7,3,3] convolution where the input is the combination of the patient note, the labels of a trial and the patient note. The same convolution operation is repeated for the second Multi-Head Self-Attention layer and concatenated with the Concatenate layer to generate the hidden representation of individual nodes.\nFor the patient note, we apply the BiLSTM on it to generate the hidden representation of words, which is fed into the Multi-Head Self-Attention layer, and then concatenated with the hidden representation of nodes generated by the first convolution before being fed into the BiLSTM again. The same BiLSTM procedure is followed for the labels of a trial. The output feature vectors of the word and node are concatenated and used as the input to the second MultiHead Self-Attention and then concatenated with the output feature vector of the labels of a trial to form the hidden representation of the full sequence. \n\nThe patient note, the clinical trial and the labels are generated with padding, so the attention vectors of each individual word or node are padded with 0 values to the left and right.\n\nFinally, the hidden representations of nodes and the output feature vectors of words and nodes are flattened and fed to a Linear layer followed by a Binary Crossentropy loss function. \n\n![2022](https://github.com/zq-zhang/YN",

In vivo, however, the functional association between HSPA14 and the proteasome remains to be determined. Here we report the identification of the Cut Homeobox protein (CUX) as a regulator of Hsp70 chaperone activity, enabling HSPA14 association with the proteasome core particle (CP). We demonstrate that this association facilitates P54(S3) endopeptidase in vitro and is essential for normal growth, development, and proteostasis maintenance. Furthermore, we show that HSPA14 accumulates in aging fly brains and is up-regulated in two distinct model systems of neurodegenerative disease. Our findings uncover an integral role for Hsp70 proteins in endopeptidase action.\n[Supplemental material is available for this article.]\nThe ubiquinous heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is highly conserved and plays critical roles in diverse processes such as protein folding, transport and turnover, and signaling pathways [bib_ref]  Molecular chaperones: integrators of cellular systems in health and disease, Soti [/bib_ref] .

In 1945, Hines and associates' reported that arteriosclerosis in the human autopsy material was more common in men with cholesterol levels above the fifth percentile of the normal male population than among those men with lower cholesterol values. Also in contrast to the Hines report, Friedman, Hess, and Gross' in 1952 found no marked correlation between the degree of atherosclerosis and serum cholesterol level in 100 men with coronary heart disease. The significance of serum lipid levels in the development of coronary atherosclerosis has recently been emphasized by Gofman\" and McNair.s In recent studies, the relationships between the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the atherosclerotic plaque size have been investigated. The present paper reports the results of some of these observations in 59 cases of coronary atherosclerosis. Serum Lipid Level Determinations-The total cholesterol levels were determined by the method of Friedewald,\" utilizing the Technicon Autoanalyzer. The triglyceride analyses were performed on the same Autoanalyzer. Both the cholesterol and triglycerides were determined from a single serum specimen from each patient. Estimation of Plaque Size in Autopsied Hearts-With the help of technicians, all of the aorta and coronary arteries of the hearts were cut across at several levels with the aid of the technicians, and each cross-section was measured. The measurements of each section were read off from a graphic record, to an accuracy of .04 cm. The plaque area in each section was determined as the difference between the sum of all the areas of the cuts and the area of the intimal surface of the cut segment.

There are two common inclusion criteria of a clinical study: age and gender. In clinical studies, one of the inclusion criteria is, for example, men aged <65 years, and the other is men aged >65 years.

Other common criteria are sex, age, and tumor type and stage. These criteria are used in the process of selecting a patient. The purpose of this assessment is to select the type and stage of the tumor that will be studied. The disease can be categorized based on whether it is simple or malignant, and the severity can be determined by the tumor stage.\n\n## Question 11 (Q102)\n\n\n\nWhat does a clinical study include? \nA) People who have a specific type of disease.

        "output": "<EOD> The relationship between prolactin and luteinizing hormone secretion: evidence for feedback from the corpus luteum.\nThe relationship between prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion was studied in patients treated for amenorrhea. The effect of estradiol on the feedback relationship between prolactin and LH was measured in ovariectomized prepubertal females. The effect of withdrawal of estradiol support on the relationship between prolactin and LH was investigated in a group of women with breast cancer who received estrogen replacement therapy. Our results indicate that a disproportionate increase in circulating prolactin is associated with low plasma LH levels. High plasma levels of LH were not associated with marked decreases in plasma prolactin levels. Administration of estradiol to suppress the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis reduced the negative feedback effect of prolactin on LH secretion. However, estrogen withdrawn from a patient with breast cancer and who was receiving estrogen replacement therapy resulted in increased prolactin levels and decreased LH concentrations. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of negative feedback from the prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors may be a disproportionate increase in circulating prolactin levels (the so-called hyperprolactinemic state). When prolactin concentrations rise above a certain threshold, the negative feedback is augmented. It is suggested that the hyperprolactinemic status seen in amenorrhea is due to endogenous disorders of LH secretion.<EOD> Proton beam therapy for pediatric malignancy: current experience in our institution.\nOBJECTIVES\nAccording to a National Survey in 1992 sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the number of children and adolescents suffering from severe malignancies was estimated to be 13,000.

This clinical study is a research project on the effects of medications on people with depression. In this clinical study, data are collected from several visits. Before each visit, the person is reminded to fill out a few questionnaires. One of these questionnaires includes questions related to the last week's usage of medication. When filling out the questionnaire, the patient is asked to enter the name of each medication they have taken each day. The names of the medications are stored in a database under the name of the medication they contain (e.g. Valium is stored under the name \"Valium\".)

In recent years, it is increasingly being used among pregnant women in early pregnancy, but the use of APAP during pregnancy has not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated the effect of APAP on activation of TLR2 and downstream inflammatory signaling. Our results showed that APAP increased transcriptional factor (NF-\u03baB) activity and production of various inflammatory proteins in a TLR2-dependent manner without affecting TLR2 expression. Treatment with APAP in the presence of inhibitors of upstream signaling components and small interfering RNA against PKC\u03b4 revealed that APAP induced activation of NF-\u03baB through PKC\u03b4 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Results of this study suggest that APAP has the potential to trigger TLR2 signaling and consequential inflammation in macrophages.<EOD> .\nThere are the three kinds of the \"three-in-one\" antibiotics: \"three times one\" that is sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), trimethoprim (TMP) and a fourth one, such as a fluoroquinolone or a sulfonamide drug together with one of the two; \"equal ratio of three\" that is SMZ, TMP, a fourth one, such as an aminoside or another sulfonamide as an equally mixed single solution with the antibiotics; \"equal-amount of three\" that is SMZ and TMP at the same concentration, and one fourth substance, like an aminopyrine, which is equal in amount.

The samples (n = 60) were either restored, using a compomer containing the remineralizing agents MI varnish (P60, GC America, USA) and MI Paste (P60, GC America, USA) or with a pure compomer. The samples were stored in either fresh artificial saliva at 37 degrees C or immersion in 1.5% citric acid solution for 24 h. The shear bond strengths were evaluated. The morphologies of the samples were studied after bond strength measurements under a scanning microscope. The shear bond strengths of the samples stored in fresh artificial saliva and the citric acid solution were statistically different, regardless of the kind of the compomer and the storage period. The best result was given by the samples stored in fresh artificial saliva. The incorporation of MI varnish or MI Paste and storage in fresh artificial saliva did not result in interfacial micro leakage.<EOD> Increase in 8-methoxypsoralen in skin and serum of patients undergoing photochemotherapy: a new method for measuring 8-methoxypsoralen in biological material by high performance liquid chromatography.\nSerum levels of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) were measured by a new method for quantitating 8-MOP by capillary high performance liquid chromatography.

There are multiple health benefits to be obtained and harms that may come with transplantation after dialysis, making the correct dialysis/ transplant decision challenging. In this review, I highlight the impact of dialysis on the kidney post-transplant and the transplant patient. I then discuss the role of dialysis in the setting of an impaired transplant. I finish the discussion with two tables of summary tables of outcomes for kidney transplantation in those patients who have had prior use of dialysis and for transplants in the setting of primary dialysis access.\nI am honoured to be asked to write on an area (nephrology/kidney-transplantation) I know so little about, but believe I am qualified to write about: the impact of dialysis care on kidney transplants and the impact of transplant care on dialysis.\n\n## Impact of dialysis on kidney transplantation\nThe transition from dialysis to a functioning kidney transplant has significant benefits in terms of quality of life including reduced psychological stress and improved social well-being.

OSA in heart failure is frequently unrecognized, and it is estimated that \u223c50% of patients with sleep apnea are undiagnosed. There is evidence that OSA adversely affects a range of cardiovascular conditions and is predictive of the development or progression of congestive heart failure. Therefore, recognizing and managing this treatable disorder is important in heart failure treatment. This review describes the diagnosis, the pathophysiology and associated adverse effects of sleep apnea, and the treatment of sleep apnea in the context of heart failure. The optimal care of patients with heart failure requires recognition that sleep apnea is common. An understanding of these issues is critical in the clinical care of this population. To improve care of patients, education of clinicians needs to be coupled with screening programs. For patients found to have sleep apnea, the standard treatment for heart failure should be implemented.

By characterizing and quantifying the HPV viral load by DNA hybridization assays and immunoassays to detect HPV oncoproteins in combination or alone, it is possible now to define the dynamic nature of the papilloma virus life cycle in the infected host, which can be used as a biomarker to help the researcher predict disease outcome in the infected host. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize studies that combined the measurement of HPV DNA and HPV cell\u2010free/cell\u2010captured mRNA or antibodies to viral oncoproteins or host proteins that bind to oncoproteins. Studies that measured at least two molecular assay types will be reviewed.<EOD> LC-MS/MS for the determination of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobut",

The rate of consumption per gender didn't show significant difference. The rate of alcohol abuse was higher in males than in females, in both years. The rate of alcohol consumption was significantly higher in youth, particularly in young adults aged 20 to 34 years, while the rate of alcohol abuse was higher in the elderly. In adults, the consumption rate remains higher than the rate of abuse. Mental disorders appeared as the main motivation; the second position was occupied by the social motivation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of NHIS data is the most important way, so far, to evaluate alcohol abuse in the general population. The results show that the rate of alcohol consumption was higher than that of alcohol abuse. The data show the necessity to improve the treatment of alcohol dependence and to decrease alcohol abuse.<EOD> The role of thrombin inhibition in treatment of arterial thrombosis and other thromboembolic",

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are produced in the process of nonenzymatic glycosylation, interact with AGEs-specific receptors (RAGEs), leading to end-stage organ damage. The present study is aimed at addressing whether HSYA can protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) against AGEs-induced disorders. HUVECs were pretreated with HSYA (0, 5, 10, 20 \u00b5M), followed by 200 \u00b5g/mL AGEs incubation. Cell viability, migration, and proliferation were examined using MTT assay, wound healing assay, and EdU incorporation assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Western blot was performed to determine the protein levels of p-p38, p-ERK, p-JNK, RAGE, Bax, Bcl-2, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The results showed that HUVECs treated with AGEs had a reduced viability, migration and proliferation, and an increased apoptosis and ICAM-1 level. HSYA reduced cell apoptosis and ICAM-1 level in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of HSYA on improving viability, migration, and proliferation were reversed by the administration of the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Our data indicate that HSYA protects HUVECs from AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, which may be mediated by p38 signaling activation and downregulation of ICAM-1.<EOD> A genetic epidemiological study of multiple sclerosis in Scotland",

Carbapenemase activity is due to the synthesis of a thiol beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing multiple beta-lactam antibiotics and its production is often associated with the presence of a plasmid. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the best known Gram-negative carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates (1,2). Up to now, three genetically different carbapenemases have been detected: i.e., GES-type, IMI-type, and KPC-type (3,4). K. pneumoniae expressing the IMI-type enzyme has been described in 1990 in Italy, but the other two enzymes were never detected in Italy or elsewhere in the world. The recent article published by Coppola et al. (5) describes two clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae that produce KPC-2 carbapenemase in Italy. This work is the best evidence so far of the worldwide dissemination of this new and dangerous class of beta-lactamase. Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is an alarming phenomenon of increasing significance in health care facilities and the community. Up to now, carbapenem resistance was associated with the production of metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-2, which has recently been observed in some clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae (6). Our preliminary study suggests that K. pneumoniae expressing KPC enzyme is more clinically significant than that expressing VIM-2, as VIM-producing K. pneumoniae has been frequently isolated since 1991 in our hospital.<EOD> Effect of endogenous renin-angiotensin system on pro-inflammatory cytokines and renal vasoconstrictor response in rats with renal ischemia reper",

Methods: In this case-control study, 100 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR test were compared with the control group of 200 adult volunteers in terms of anthropometric features. Body mass index, blood pressure, biochemical tests, and abdominal ultrasound were performed for all participants. Results: In our NAFLD patients, serum AST (58\u00b135.2 compared to 37\u00b153 IU/L) and ALT (70\u00b156 compared to 43\u00b185 IU/L) were significantly higher than that of controls, indicating a hepatic injury. The prevalence of NAFLD was higher among patients with COVID-19 than among the control participants (p<0.001). In addition, the NAFLD patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of having severe COVID-19 when compared to the control group members (p<0.001). Conclusion: We found that patients with NAFLD are susceptible to severe COVID-19, and may provide a guide for further evaluation of patients for the disease.\n\n# Introduction\nAt the end of 2019, a novel virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or the 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV-2) emerged in China as a causative agent of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan that rapidly spread all over the world.

However, little is known regarding the effect of this novel therapeutic agent in vWD patients with inhibitor(s) to FVIII. We report two patients with a history of intractable hemorrhage, in whom recombinant activated human factor VII was effective in controlling acute intractable hemorrhage and allowed urgent major surgery. However, the dosages needed to control bleeding were larger than expected in patients with vWD and inhibitor(s) to FVIII because the patients' FVIII inhibitor titer diminished gradually. The half-lives of activated FVII in both patients were approximately 23 hours, although the half-life of recombinant factor VII in healthy volunteers is about 60 hours and this may also affect optimal dosage. In a laboratory examination, it was clear that the activity of recombinant activated human factor VII did not change during its storage time.<EOD> Anesthetic Efficacy of 4% Articaine Administered Via Conventional Needle Penetration vs. Painless Maxillofacial Injections-A Randomized Single blind Clinical Trial\n\nPMCID: PMC8505784 J Med Sci: 2022; 26 (8): 300-307\n\n# Introduction\nA successful anesthesia is a pre-requisite for a successful minor surgical procedure.

Stents are especially commonly used in patients with kidney calculi, which prevent the flow of urine. Stents have a variety of potential side effects including urinary tract infections (UTIs). Most urinary tract infections are mild and not life threatening, however, they may cause septicemia and renal failure, which can be fatal. There are two commonly prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections: cefazolin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The risk of infection from a urinary stent placed in the urinary tract is higher in some patients.

The effects of nitric oxide (NO) on energy metabolism in astroglial cells (astrocytes) are discussed. Astroglia play a major role in the regulation of brain cell energy metabolism by generating lactate using glycolysis in astrocytes, which is then transferred to neighboring neurons using astroglial-neuronal lactate transport (ALT). Astrocytes regulate the synthesis of ALT through the regulation of ATP, pyruvate, and lactate. This study proposes that NO is involved in the regulation of ATP and lactate, which could affect energy metabolism and cell cycle progression.<EOD> .\nNinety-three patients with severe burns were treated by a method based on that of burns treatment in the Netherlands between August 1987 and February 1988.

The key concept behind STRAW is to be able to compare any patient note to the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial on the fly, given the patient's electronic health record. The system can also suggest other trials with similar eligibility of a given patient.\nWe have also shown that medical natural language processing is a powerful tool to help health practitioners in their daily work. We have proved the existence of important medical concepts as \"eligibility\", \"exclusion criterion\" etc. that are used in clinical trial recruitment, and that their analysis is feasible within the scope of automatic natural language processing.\n\n# Limitation\n\n# Limitation:\nThere are some limitations to our system. Firstly there may be some missing inclusion or exclusion criteria that are not yet documented. For example, if one clinical trial has a more demanding eligibility criterion such as \"patients with type 1 diabetes\", we can't include them into our system. Secondly, we extract the inclusion and exclusion criteria from clinical trial registries that require the inclusion and exclusion of variables explicitly.\n\n# Result\n\n# Result:\nOur automatic and efficient solution for clinical trial recruitment improves the performance of the practitioners by providing a fast, reliable, consistent and objective method to compare patients to clinical trials. As future work we plan to test the STRAW tool in real world settings, and we are looking forward to receive feedback from the actual health practitioners.\nWe also plan to extend the STRAW tool with an ontology of diseases, and we will build an interface to this ontology to give suggestions of the most similar diseases when a patient has an eligibility with respect to an inclusion criterion.

In this example you are to output the same trial-level eligibility for the above patient note and clinical trial. For this example I'll use a `Duplicates.js` file, a [JavaScript module]() available from GitHub. \n\nLet's think about the requirements. One requirement is that you are to output only `1;`. That means you have to disallow the entry of `2;`. I'll explain more about this requirement below. Another is that you are to output the same assessment of eligibility. Here we should not rely on the user input, we'll set the output upfront. Let's make use of [constants]() objects. Constants in JavaScript are variables which should be imported once and never modified. They are always initialized before any variable in the module. In this way they do not cause any side effect and are easier to maintain. \n\nFirst, let's declare all of the constants needed for this exercise.\n```javascript\nlet Trial = 'The Relationship Between Vitamin D, Fingernail Thickness and Bone Density';\nlet Scale = '2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.';\nlet Patient = 'An 85-year-old man';\nlet PatientNote = `An 85-year-old man is brought to the ER because of gradual decrease in his level of consciousness.

Skinfold thicknesses at biceps, triceps, subscapular, iliac crest, axilla, suprailiac, midaxillary, front thigh, medial calf, and medial upper arm were measured with a Harpenden skinfold caliper. Total fat mass (FMt) and percentage of total body fat (%BF) were estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with an Inbody 2.0. Total body water (TBW) was computed by using FFM and the values of TBW according to Siri.

However, the functional role of PEDF in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in response to pressure overload remain to be determined. We generated transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing human (h) PEDF in heart under control of cardiac-restricted \u03b1-myosin heavy chain promoter. Here, we studied in vivo and in vitro models of cardiac hypertrophy by transverse aortic banding to characterize the role of PEDF in cardiac hypertrophy. Compared with non-TG (N) littermates, echography and morphometry analyses of TG mice showed significantly lower weight and left ventricle wall thickness, increased fractional shortening, and decreased lung weight to body weight ratio. In addition, cardiac PEDF mRNA expression was found to be significantly higher while the expressions of atrial natriuretic protein and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly lower in TG mice. Protein analysis showed markedly attenuated p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 in TG mice, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation. Examination of human cardiac tissues from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed the levels of both PEDF mRNA and protein were significantly lower than those from patients at baseline. Furthermore, our results showed a significant correlation between the decreased expression of PEDF and increased angiotensin II (Ang II) in peripheral blood. These observations demonstrated PEDF is a physiological inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy.<EOD> Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Risk Factors in Patients Presenting for Coronary Artery Surgery in Central India.\nDementia is a growing public health issue and",

Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers. Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls, gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome measures within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an intervention to reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.~Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a higher risk of",

Currently, more than twenty genes related to ciliary ultrastructure and function are being studied as possible biomarkers for PCD, and CCDC39 is a novel gene reported recently. To date, 11 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within this gene have been reported. In the present study, we investigated a novel c.1245C > G mutation in CCDC39 in a family with PCD and the impact on ciliary ultrastructure.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFive members of a family underwent genetic screening for CCDC39 mutations with a combination of targeted sequencing and Sanger sequencing.

We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) with the aim of determining whether interventions to reduce PUI could be recommended.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched multiple databases to identify SRs examining interventions in preventing PUI in adults of any age, of which older people were a sub-group. We extracted data from included SRs on methodology, study setting and intervention; study design, outcome measures and findings; and any economic evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 16 SRs and their 247 primary studies. Thirteen were conducted in one or more hospital setting; three in community-specific settings. All SRs focused on PUI prevention rather than management. The majority used unrestricted inclusion criteria; 13 used risk of bias tools and only three conducted formal meta-analysis. Only one SR contained clear economic analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe limited information on the quality of the primary studies and small number of SRs in this area suggests the need for further work on PUIs in older people to improve this underresearched area.<EOD> .\nIt is estimated that one third of world vegetal resources can be found in the Andean area, of which 18,582 plant species are found in Mexico.

Interventions to address these deficits remain a challenge. Evidence Acquisition:A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the early application of an in-hospital neurorehabilitation program for improving mobility and neurocognitive outcomes in survivors of moderate-to-severe stroke; 49 consecutive patients 18 years of age or older with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) severity scores greater than 16 were randomized and allocated to early hospital-based (2 wk) versus conventional therapy. For intervention patients, treatment was tailored to individual patient needs and was performed for 2 weeks by a team of specialized physiotherapists. Outcome measures included the Barthel Index, Functional Ambulation Categories, Modified Ashworth Scale, Manual Function Test, Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, Visual Object and Space Perception Test, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. All patients were assessed on admission and at 1 and 18 months after stroke.

The investigators aim to assess whether continued aspirin treatment increases the risk of CSDH in mild head trauma patients 50 years and older who present with negative head CT. The investigators further aim to use the initial findings to refine the study design, with the goal of performing a larger, multi-institutional study in the future.~Over a 12-month period, approximately 100 patients \u226550 years of age on LDA prophylaxis presenting to Hadassah's Emergency Department after sustaining mild head injury, will be examined by the neurosurgeon on call.

In this investigation, we explored the antitumor activity of polydatin and the conjugate of 5,10-dihydroxycamptothecin (DHCPT) and polydatin (PD-CPT) in vitro and in vivo. The molecular structures of PD-CPT and DHCPT were fully characterized by (1)H-NMR and ESI-MS spectra; the PD-CPT was prepared by a facile coupling reaction of DHCPT and PD; the results showed that PD-CPT had a stronger inhibitory effect upon human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (H460) or human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT116 p53(-/-)) than DHCPT and could sensitize the apoptosis resistance of p53-null HCT116 cells to DHCPT. The binding mode of PD to human topoisomerase (hTop1) was investigated by the kinetic constant assay, fluorescence titration, surface plasma resonance (SPR), circular dichroism, and molecular modeling technique. These assays indicated that PD could be used as a substrate of hTop1 to inhibit the activity of hTop1; furthermore, PD could bind Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and trap the enzyme-DNA binary complex.

Increased binding of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to SERT has been implicated as a mechanism underlying response to antidepressants in some patients, and preclinical studies indicate TA-0910 has superior serotonergic neuroplasticity effects compared with SSRIs. Because response to antidepressants is variable and heterogeneous it is possible that antidepressant activity is not dependent on enhanced SERT inhibition. Here we assessed the effects of TA-0910 in a model of Tourette's syndrome (TS), as a model of heterogeneous and non-response to antidepressants with a heterogeneous phenotype including abnormal behaviors similar to tics. Chronic infusion of TA-0910 into the nucleus accumbens of male CD1 and B6 mice did not alter apomorphine-induced stereotyped behaviors, such as head twitch responses (HTRs), although the latter mouse strain responded. A TA-0910 dose-dependent increase in the number of HTRs was observed at some doses in CD1 and B6 mice and suggests the effects of TA-0910 in this behavior are not identical between strains. TA-0910 treatment of mice transgenic for the human SERT gene in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, resulted in elevated amphetamine-induced locomotion, an effect we have shown previously in these mice is attributable to elevated 5-",

The leftmost line must be the patient ID. We will set it to `1` by default. When we have multiple patients in one note, we will still need only 6 lines which show patient ID, Trial-level eligibility, Inclusion criteria, and Trial status and outcome. You can modify the output in the code to any other formats. I will demonstrate the other output formats later.\n\nOne other thing we need is a dictionary to store the information for each clinical trial, such as patient ID, eligibility criteria, clinical trial status, inclusion criteria, etc. You can simply define it in the code below. As you can see, the dictionary information has several sub-types with different properties. We will discuss its each sub-types later.\n\n```python\n# 24/27\ndef eligibility_for_trial(path):\n    global recruitment_info\n\n    recruitment_info['clinical_trial_path'] = path\n\n    # We will get a file object and a list of lines\n    with open(path, 'r') as f:\n        linest = ''.join(f.readlines()).splitlines()\n\n    linest = linest[3:7] # Note the colon \":\"\n    linest = linest.replace(\"  'TrialLevelEligibility : \", '').replace(\"- \", \"_\").split(\"\\n\") # Remove spaces and quotes.\n\n    recruitment_info['TrialLevelEligibiilty'] = linest[0] \n    recruitment_info['InclusionCriteria'] = linest[1]\n    # This line represents `TrialIncluded : 1`. The \"1\" will be ignored. So we will compare the string with `InclusionCriteria",

We show that the contribution of the defects to protonic charge dynamics is more significant than that of the bulk protons, and that there exists no stable equilibrium defect structure if it acts as a proton carrier. We show that protons are localized when oxide ion vacancies serve as proton carriers, and oxide anion vacancies are also unstable if they are responsible for proton conduction.\nHydrogen is ubiquitous in nature, being present in water and in almost all biomolecules 1 . The presence of hydrogen in chemistry is therefore important, and the properties of fluids made of hydrogen are important also in industrial context, especially in proton conducting devices.
