The tasks you will cover now are the ones that are most commonly performed in clinical NLP: part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and named entity recognition.\n\nFor each sentence, we will provide a text file, and you need to provide the output file, containing part-of-speech tags and parsing results. \nWe used the dependency parsing methods of CoNLL and BioNLP-ST. This is the output of the example sentence when parsing using CoNLL.\nThe words highlighted in red are verbs in the sentence, and we can perform parsing on the verbs by dependency parsing.\n\nParentheses in CoNLL indicate the beginning and end of the words.\n\n```\nSuch methods are more suitable for tasks such as clinical trials.\n```\nA CoNLL parse tree visualized by OpenNLP is shown below: *The words with the prefix `root_` in the graph are called the parents in parse trees, whereas those without a prefix are called the children. The roots of the sentence are denoted with _1_. *A node in CoNLL is a class with a name and an array of 10 values. This parsing model is simple and suitable for parsing tasks such as text tagging and parsing. OpenNLP is an open source dependency parsing system.\nAs you can see, it is a hierarchical graph where dependencies can be made between any pair of words. For example, `root_1 nsubj passive such methods` is the subject and `the verbs in the sentence are verbs, whereas `1 prep is more` is the object of the verb `Such methods`. \nThe parser used in BioNLP-ST has a complex parsing tree topology and provides many tree-based features, such as lexical information (left, right, head) and dependency labels.\nThe following is the parse tree diagram from the ST parse results:\n\n```\nTRAIN EFFECT BIOMECHANISMS PHARMACOLOGIC BLACKSBURG UNIV UVA BLACKSBURG IMPACTS MEDICAL MILE",

Within a few days all the flies died and their dead bodies wrere cut open, but no sipirochdtes were found in the fly itself.\nOne fly containing spirilla was then put in another test-tube with fresh warm milk in which a guinea-pig was placed. About six hours after the fly was fed, both the fly and the guinea-pig died from putrescence. On cut surface of the liver of the guiniea-pig about 50 or more spirochajetes were found in one small space of cut surface of liver of the guinea-pig.\nExperiments with Spirochaetes in the Laboratory.?The following experiments were made with spirochdte cultures.\nFresh guinea-pigs were killed and their muscles were cut in a sterile pettolein bottle and placed under a cover in a warm place. The pettolein culture was then flooded with the spirochaetes. As a result, several of the guinea-pigs in 24 hours showed fever and had to be killed. After a time they developed in the abdominal cavity a characteristic suppurating lesion and soon died from sepsis.\nThe following are observations of the characteristic lesion of bovine spiirillosis from the laboratory experiments, also made some time ago; viz., A strait round swelling developed in the muscles, followed by the formation of abscess.

As you work through the solutions, it is important to pay special attention to the comments. For example, the comments will tell you the exact name of the functions (e.g., `Trial-level_eligibility()`) you need to call to solve the assignment, which might be useful knowledge for you later in the course. In addition, the comments will tell you the functions you need to call once you have written the functions and methods.\n\n# Using Functions, Methods, Variables, and Objects\nTo solve this assignment, you will have to use functions, methods, variables, and objects to help you in your solution. This section will discuss how these programming tools will be used in your solution.\n\n## Defining Variable Names\nThere is a lot of confusion about using variable names in a scientific manner. To help you identify when you have properly used or not used variable names, follow these guidelines:\n\nThe naming convention for variables begins with underscores (\"_\"). These variables are to be used for internal workings within a function. For example, the name for the patient note is \"_patient note\"; \"_patient trial\" is the name of the patient note for a given clinical trial. The name of a patient for a clinical trial is \"_patient\".\n\nVariables such as \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"n\", etc., are reserved for global arrays in the language. If you use these names, the code will not work. If the variables begin with either an uppercase letter (\"R\", \"S\", \"T\", etc.) or a lowercase letter (\"r\", \"s\", \"t\", etc.), Python will interpret them as variables but will report an error. Variables such as \"s\" (one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter) will result in a different error (see below).\n\nVariables should follow these general rules:\n\n* no leading zeros (000 or 00)\n\n* no leading spaces in front of numeric values (0_patient)\n\n* no spaces at the end of variables\n\n* no apostrophe in the variable name, as in ``'I_am'\".   _i_am becomes _iam",

The cytotoxic and cytokine-producing functional status of CD8+ T cells in tumors, serum IL2 levels, and patient 5-year survival rate were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We observed that the expression of FoxP3+CD8+ T cells correlated with favorable characteristics and improved survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. FoxP3+CD8+ T cells infiltrated tumor and/or peritumor stroma in some hepatocellular carcinoma patients and FoxP3+CD8+ T cells positively correlated with increased IL2 protein secretion and IL2 levels in serum. Our data suggest that the function of FoxP3+CD8+ T cells might differ depending on the CD8 T cell phenotype and/or the tumor microenvironment.

C4bBP is extensively phosphorylated in the blood, on seven serine residues. In this study, we show that C4bBP phosphorylation protects it from cleavage by the membrane attack complex (MAC), a supramolecular assemblage of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 on cellular surfaces. Purified C4bBP was cleaved by the MAC, especially in the presence of heparin, although the extent of this cleavage was lower than that observed for C3g but comparable to that observed for C9g. Phosphorylated C4bBP was far less susceptible to MAC cleavage. In fact, nonphosphorylated 32P-labeled C4bBP was not cleaved. Interestingly, native C4bBP was found to be cleaved by MAC in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individual, despite a lack of significant C4bBP phosphorylation. It is highly likely that C4bBP cleavage results in an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. In addition, the reduced cleavage of C4bBP is partially responsible for the increased immune complexes that accumulate on the surface of the cells of these patients.<EOD> Recipes and notes \u203a\u203a Baked \u203a\u203a Salads and Side Dishes \u203a\u203a Zucchini-baked corn, peanut butter, and balsamic dressing salad\nZucchini-baked corn, peanut butter, and balsamic dressing salad\nYield: 4 servings\nIngredients:\n1 large orange bell pepper, cut into large wedges",

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between marijuana use and cause of death. Design: This was a retrospective chart analysis of all cases reported to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office (SDCMEO), an office which serves all deaths in the City of San Diego and in certain areas of neighboring Southwestern States, from January 1989 to December 2008. A computer retrieval system was reviewed to identify fatalities related to the use of marijuana. A total of 12\u2009755 autopsies were performed during this 20-year period. Results: Of these, 10.97% (1358/12\u2009755) reported marijuana-related deaths. The most common cause of death for those who did not have any other contributing drug, and who had marijuana as the only drug, was suicide at 91.44% (127/138).

A severe attack of pancreatic necrosis and peritonitis is the usual cause of death in patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Thus the value of early diagnosis and prompt operation is obvious. As the symptoms in patients with malignant disease of the head of the pancreas are usually those of obstructive jaundice\u2014i.e. anorexia, nausea, and weight loss\u2014early diagnostic assessment is simple. Unfortunately, at this early stage of tumour progression, diagnosis is still difficult. The extent and severity of jaundice can be estimated at its worst, and the time between the onset of jaundice and the appearance of hepatic failure provides a guide to the prognosis, which is more useful in clinical decision-making than the jaundice alone. A retrospective analysis of the cases of obstructive jaundice seen at this hospital in the last decade and in whom the diagnosis was not known when the patient presented in hospital is presented below. The patients are described using the terminology adopted under the auspices of the B.A.R. Committee on Obstructive Jaundice (1964). The group is not large, and there are therefore considerable overlaps in subgroups and individual grades of jaundice. The most frequent diagnosis was carcinoma of the liver (55 per cent); obstructive jaundice from duodenal ulcer or chronic pan.creatitis accounted for 16\u00b71 per cent and from pancreatic carcinoma for 11 per cent. There were 9 per cent of cases of obstructive jaundice of undetermined origin.

Bone formation was assessed by bone isopropyl (p)-amino-proprionid acid excretion and bone resorption by urine pyriduria of total pyridinoline (Pyr Py), deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr Py), and free Pyr Py in the 24-hour urine. BMD at the spine was below normal even in patients who were 1 month post-transplant; in contrast, the BMD determined at the total body remained within the normal range. Lumbar BMD normalized within 8 to 12 months after transplantation. No correlation was apparent between BMD at the spine or total body and serum calcitriol, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Bone formation was well below normal even in patients whose transplantations had been performed 1 year or longer. The pyridine crosslinks were increased in serum PTH levels. In a subset of patients, they correlated positively with the serum iPTH level (r = 0.36 to 0.64) but not with any other endogenous factors. The results show that the low BMD after transplantation develops early after transplantation and normalizes thereafter and that bone turnover, in contrast to BMD, remains elevated.

The N-terminal domain of human Nucleolin is unique of the mammalian Nucleolin species. We cloned and expressed the N-terminal fragment of human Nucleolin (1-243 amino acids) in baculovirus. We showed that this domain of Nucleolin (N-terminal domain) is able to bind in vitro with a high affinity the double-stranded DNA homologous to the promoter region of the c-myc gene and to the purine-rich sequence located within c-myc coding region. Moreover, we found that the N-terminal domain represses in vitro transcription of c-myc gene both in the presence and in the absence of nuclear extract. This study suggests that the N-terminal domain of human Nucleolin can be included in the family of transcription factors",

The number of errors and reaction times were assessed while using standard auditory (S-TD) versus Hw-TD devices connected to an external audio player that administered standard digits and arithmetic problems. In addition, verbal responses in correct/incorrect format were also recorded for comparison with the results of the arithmetic test. The study included 30 participants aged 25-40 years (15 young adults and 15 middle-aged adults). The participants' performance and reaction times were assessed in two consecutive sessions. First were assessed in the Hw-TD session (using the Hw-TD device connected to a laptop), and were than performed on the standard auditory (S-TD) device session (using it connected to an external audio player connected to a laptop). Two standard cognitive tests were applied to evaluate the participants' performance. The first test was the mental transposition test (MTT), and the second was numeral subtraction test (NST). The results showed that participants made less errors in the Hw-TD session. The average reaction time was the same in both sessions. No significant results were detected for the MTT; however, statistically significant results were detected for NST tests. A significant impact of device type was found with reaction times. Reaction times were shorter in the Hw-TD session compared to the S-TD session only for the digit 9. Our results showed that the Hw-TD improves participants' performance in the NST by reducing the number of errors made, especially for the digit 9.\n\n# Introduction\nAttention is described as the ability to divide resources and to selectively focus on aspects of the environment.

Two of the more prominent isozymes could be resolved by phosphocellulose paper chromatography and exhibited Mr values of 90 kD and 80 kD in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Although the two bands co-migrated in 10-15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, these preparations showed clearly that, under conditions of electrophoresis that maintain non-covalent interactions, the Mr 90 band migrated cathodally more rapidly than the Mr 80 isozyme. On the basis of these differences, and considering that the Mr 80 isozyme, unlike the Mr 90 isozyme, lacks an N-terminal glycosylation site, it was concluded that the two differentially phosphorylated isozymes were structurally closely related but were at least heterophosphorylated at different sites.<EOD> Intrathecal administration of the neuropeptide galanin produces prolonged reversal of thermal hyperalgesia in the rat.\n1.

However, personality traits have been proposed as modifying and explanatory factors for the relationship between parent monitoring and adolescent substance use. Nevertheless, no studies to date have yet tested the possible mediating or conditional indirect effect of personality traits for this relationship using a structural equation and multilevel framework. Furthermore, although the most widespread instruments to assess personality dimensions combine personality traits as dimensions of temperament or character (e.g., TEMPS-A and CCQT), no studies have tested the conditional indirect effect of both temperament and character on parent monitoring and substance use. A sample of 1092 parents and adolescents was used (average age = 44.89 and 14.11, respectively). First, the mediating role of adolescent temperament and character traits was examined in a conditional indirect effect model. Second, temperament and character traits were simultaneously examined in a simultaneous mediation model. No mediating or conditional indirect effects for the relationship between parental monitoring and adolescent substance use were observed. However, the results showed the existence of a complementary mediating role of certain temperamental variables (depressive mood and impulsiveness) on the relationship between parental monitoring and adolescent substance use. This study showed no mediation or conditional indirect effects linking parental monitoring and substance use through temperament and character traits. However, adolescents with high levels of depressive mood and impulsiveness showed higher levels of substance use, and the moderator effect of temperamental dimensions was observed on the relationship between parental monitoring and substance use.

It is shown that the polarity of the solvent used to dissolve the polymer strongly affects all three damage processes and consequently the threshold. The UV laser damage initiation was monitored by analyzing the spectra of photomicrograph of the discolored film. An empirical relationship describing the threshold versus photon energy for UV irradiation is presented.<EOD> Evaluating an intervention to reduce social inequalities in alcohol use\n\nBackgroundWe reported previously that the intervention was not effective in reducing binge drinking frequency or frequency of not using a condom in the past year.

The two rice subspecies, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and O. sativa ssp. indica, are the two most important subspecies (subgroup) in the Oryza genus. One intersubspecific cross was investigated in this study for the hybrid breeding between these two subspecies, but its offspring was an obligate hybrid. In this study, we performed a genome-wide microarray experiment to uncover the altered expression of genes between the hybrid and their progenitor subspecies. Results: The expression profile of each subspecies' genes showed the obvious diverging tendency. In the hybrid, the expression level of genes showed alterations between the two subspecies with significant variation tendencies detected at 3 time points. Furthermore, those genes shared similar expression patterns were found to participate in the same GO functions. These altered genes, most of which showed up-regulation, encoded proteins involved in basic metabolism and development, cellular transcription and RNA splicing, and signal transduction during the early stages of hybrid development. Conclusion: In this study, the different altered expression levels of the genes between the hybrid and its parent subspecies are related to the different parental genomes in the intersubspecific hybridizations, and their expression changes were involved in genetic divergence and speciation. These large-scale altered genes are useful for us to uncover the possible mechanisms of natural hybridization and speciation or of new gene expression regulation caused by hybridization and speciation.\n\n# Background\nHybridization is an important contributing factor in evolution.

Echocardiographically, the arch was seen to be narrow and hypoplastic. We performed surgical repair with aortopulmonary bypass on postoperative day 6. Aorta-to-aorta anastomosis was performed between the ascending aorta and the false lumen of the descending aorta, as our patient's subarch bronchus and duodenum were compressed by the true lumen, which was much thinner than normal. After reconstruction of the descending aorta, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was closed with a Teflon pledget suture ligature. We planned the next operation to resect the subaortic ridge to enlarge the outflow tract of the left ventricle later. On postoperative day 4, the patient was extubated to continuous positive airway pressure. On postoperative day 20, tracheostomy was removed. On postoperative day 80, aortography was performed to verify the correct alignment of the graft, and to evaluate by aortic arch circulation was adequate and the left ventricle was functioning normally.

The mechanism underlying this interaction has been well studied using proteolytic activation or mutational studies at the heparin-binding site. These studies have suggested that a conformational change in the S1\u2032-subdomain triggers the heparin-binding event, and this change is thought to be critical for thrombin binding to its peptide substrates. Mutations disrupting the structural integrity of S1\u2032-subdomain reduce the heparin-binding ability of thrombin. The purpose of this study is to use molecular dynamics simulations of thrombin to investigate the role of the S1\u2032-subdomain in heparin binding. A 42-ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed in order to study the conformational changes in heparin-binding site of thrombin. It was found that the S1\u2032-subdomain undergoes structural changes upon heparin binding. We also found that a water molecule acts as a bridge for Glu51 and Arg56. These two residues are known to be important for heparin binding. Our results suggest that a water molecule acts as a link between Glu51 and Arg56 to form a highly active binding site on the thrombin surface\u2014this water molecule is part of a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic residues involved in the thrombin-heparin interaction.<EOD> Genetic variation in the promoters of the P-glycoprotein ABCB1 gene and its relationship with human brain volume\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that genetic variation in the promoter region of the P-glycoprotein ABCB1 gene (MDR1) is associated with human brain size.

Methods Participants were 45 pregnant women in an antenatal care setting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. In order to examine the predictors for exclusive and partial breastfeeding cessation, we performed a cross-sectional analysis (n=40) using logistic regression analysis. The cutoff points of antenatal depressive symptoms were based on a validated measure. results The main analyses indicated that women with depressive symptoms were more likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding within 1 month of delivery. No significant association was found between depressive symptoms and partial breastfeeding at 6 months. A multilevel logistic regression indicated a possible link between participants' perception of their partner's pregnancy-related anxiety and non-breastfeeding status at 6 months (p=0.057), while this effect was non-significant in the main analysis. conclusions Antenatal depressive symptoms may be related to exclusive breastfeeding cessation, and the perception of partner's pregnancy-related anxiety may predict non-breastfeeding status at 6 months postpartum.\n\n# Introduction\nExclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is one of the greatest contributions to child survival, growth and development, especially during the newborn period.It is associated with a reduced risk of diarrhoea, pneumonia and infectious diseases,which have been proven to be leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age.In developed countries, the most common reasons for breastfeeding cessation among mothers are the perceived insufficient milk supply, work and/or time constraints, pressure from family and friends to introduce (complementary) foods to the infant,and depressive problems.Breastfeeding cessation among mothers from developing countries is linked to health",

You are a helpful assistant for the diagnosis of a rare condition named Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\n## Cardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium (the heart muscle) characterized by the weakening and deterioration of the heart muscle. It leads to an inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood towards the body, or can sometimes cause sudden heart failure.Cardiac muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle can't pump blood as well as it should. Cardiomyopathy weakens the heart. It makes it harder to pump the blood around the body. There are several types of cardiomyopathy. One of these types is named Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The symptoms of Takotsubo, or \"broken heart syndrome,\" are very similar to those of a heart attack, although no blockage of a coronary artery occurs.\n\n## Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\nTakotsubo Cardiomyopathy, also known as Broken Heart Syndrome, is a \"heart attack of the heart. In a typical heart attack, a coronary artery becomes blocked. As a result, the heart's flow of blood is reduced. In Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, the heart's main muscle becomes inflamed. The heart's muscle is damaged by the buildup of a lot of fluid in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has trouble pumping blood to the body.\nYour job is to evaluate the patient's heart. You are going to compare it with healthy people.\n\n## Patient\nA",

        "output": "#### Q. Can all your patients be assessed in this task? \nYes. For example, if we encounter a patient below the age limit listed in the trial, we can set `Age in years: ` to be below 18 years. We can set `Type of disease: ` to `Cancer` so that this patient cannot be assessed as potentially eligible anymore. As long as our patient's status meets the requirements of the trial, he/she will be assessed as eligible by default. \n\n## Trivia: I'd like to share this anecdote with you. The clinical trial in the challenge, as I mentioned in the previous section, is called Evaluation of Integrated Cardiac Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease. I really liked the idea of `integrated` here, not separated, not disintegrated, a combination, a collaboration, a unification, a cooperation, a mutual support, or a coordination, all of `integrated' meanings were good, for example, `a group of people that are working together' (in English, there is actually no word like integrated, only `integration` is used to mean a joined or joined with others). However, if we consider this medical trial, the integration (cooperation) of different imaging modalities should not be emphasized. The imaging modalities included in this clinical trial, namely, echocardiography, CT angiography (CTA) and coronary angiography, are complementary ones (some overlap is inevitable). \n\n## Preparation Phase.\nThe patient (Note: a person who is going to be assessed for eligibility) is usually assessed with history taking and physical examination. Therefore, you must know the clinical trial information of the patient before determining the final Trial-level eligibility. \n\n## Solution\n\nTo solve this challenge, we suggest the use of the library [pysas](https://github.com/sas/pysas), which is an SAS wrapper for Python. You may refer to the official tutorial of [Using PySAS](https://doc.sas.com/en/webapps/pySAS/usingpySAS.html) to create your project and then import it. In the process of importing, you can",

Although biochemical evaluation is sometimes sufficient to diagnose the disease early in life, it is typically not until later, when the complications of the disease such as blindness and renal failure develop, that the diagnosis is clear in the mind of the attending physician. This early clinical presentation is not infrequently confounded by the effects of severe intercurrent infection. Vitamin B12 treatment is frequently not commenced until the biochemical phenotype has been defined by chromatographic, chromatofocusing, or gel electrophoretic analysis of the methylmalonyl CoA mutase protein extracted from the patient's cells. This can be a time-consuming process and an unnecessary delay in administering the potentially beneficial treatment. A rapid immunological assay for the presence of protein in patient erythrocytes from the vitamin B12-responsive form of methylmalonic aciduria has been developed that is specific, easily applied, and gives useful biochemical information.

It is also important to investigate the possibility of automatic analysis and visualization of patient note contents based on text mining. It is very ambitious to try to use natural language processing to detect the eligibility of a patient by comparing patient note to a trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria list using a computer system. This may add great value to doctors, but the challenge to get enough training data to develop a robust computer algorithm for the automatic detection and classification is not an easy task.

However, the IEF can be considered negligible compared to the electric field (EF) induced by the current in the temperature gradient (TG) due to the high aspect ratio between the in-plane dimension and out-plane dimension of bulk thermoelectrics. It is believed that there should be a special material which satisfies the same aspect ratio for the validity of the above approximation. The IEF, EF, and TG are mutually orthogonal directions in this case. Here, we used  p-type Ge-Te-Sn (GeTe-2%Sn) as an experimental material to achieve mutually orthogonal TG, EF, and IEF. We discovered that the TG-induced EF and IEF had opposite effects on the Seebeck coefficient (S) of GeTe-2%Sn, while they had comparable effects on its electrical conductivity \u03c3. The EF and IEF also had opposite effects on the total entropy generation coefficient Sgtotal. By using the Fourier analysis method, we also quantitively analyzed the influence of the EF (IEF) and the TG on the S (\u03c3) as a function of frequency. The present investigation is expected to shed light on the validity of the approximation and will benefit the experimental and theoretical study of bulk thermoelectrics and nanogenerators.<EOD> Assessing the contribution of matrotrophy to maternal nutrient management in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus.\nEggs and larvae of pelagic teleosts are nutritionally autonomous for the first few days after hatching. This allows the mother to regulate the nutrient content of the yolk (the yolk sac) using maternal energy stores as a reserve, and to vary the amount of food the offspring receives during larval development. In the present study, we investigated the effects of variation in yolk sac content (sacnutrient content) on larval growth of Atlantic cod (Gad",

Recently, we have investigated the polymerization of benzoxazoles (Xu et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2011). Herein, we report the molecular structure of the title compound, which was isolated in crystalline form during the preparation of benzoxazole by ring-opening of oxa-analogon of 4-aza-5-heptonate with substituted benzaldehydes and 4-hydroxy-2,6-dioxocyclohexanone (Scheme 1). The asymmetric unit of title compound(Fig. 1)contains three independent molecules, A, B and C, which are located on crystallographic 2-fold rotation axes. Bond lengths and angles are in normal ranges(Kirkland, 2006), and are comparable to known values.In the polymers, the benzoxazole ring (C11/C12/O2/C18-C20) is nearly planar, with maximum deviations of 0.020 (5) \u00c5 for atom O2 and 0.047 (5) \u00c5 for atom C18.

The report showed an astonishing 71% percent in 1995 of all births among American teens to be unintended. Over a quarter of teenagers had been sexually active in the year that preceded their interview, with two-thirds of these young men and women reporting that they did not use a method of birth control that could reliably prevent pregnancy before intercourse began.

Despite its high prevalence and negative outcomes, the diagnosis of AF is complicated by its variable manifestation and interim periods of normal sinus rhythm (NSR), during which its presence can only be confirmed by standard electrocardiogram (ECG).

Methods: Sixty-four patients with AS and 37 healthy controls were observed for this retrospective study. Gait variables were recorded with an instrumented walking mat (GaitRite\u2122) and used to calculate step length, single support, and variability for each foot separately. Foot pressure distribution was examined. Disease characteristics and functional outcome scales, such as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index were also used. Data were compared among the involved limbs of patients, among AS patients and healthy controls.Results: Diseased individuals showed a shorter step length in the involved limbs (90.2 cm) than in the contralateral limbs (92.7 cm) and on the healthy side (93.0 cm) (P < 0.0001); however, the difference was not found to be significant (P > 0.05) among the different groups. In addition, the peak single support time of the involved limbs in AS patients and healthy controls was found to be higher than the contralateral limbs at the initial contact time, but not significant (P > 0.05). The pressure values under the heel and foot were also found to be higher in the active limbs (872.03 and 270.52 mg/s) than the contralateral limbs (664.59 and 215.75 mg/s) and healthy controls (739.06 and 250.20 mg/s) (P < 0.0001 for pressure under the heel, P < 0.05 for pressure under the foot).

The detection platform, referred to in this study as the Microbial Detection Array, consists of four arrayed, individually addressable, field-effect transistor-based chemi- and biosensors fabricated using standard, semiconductor manufacturing technologies. The individual chemically responsive and bacteriometric sensors were developed so as to provide separate information on pH and the presence of cell surface-bound L-arabinose, respectively. Initial results have confirmed the ability of the system to conduct specific, real-time, whole-cell detection of a culture of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium in unprocessed water, while simultaneously measuring its pH level.

In this study, a dissipative system driven by an intrinsic stochastic force in a high energy state is presented. Two kinds of systems are discussed: one is a single system driven by a stochastic Lorentz force (the L-system) and the other is a coupled system driven by two stochastic Lorentz forces (the C-system). Although the L-system and the Csystem show the same macrostate, there appear to be two kinds of microstates: the energy microstates, which correspond to the energy states in conventional statistical mechanics, and the st",

Both MBP and PLP are rich in amino acid residues, which determine their susceptibility to hydrolyse by a range of endopeptidases. Moreover, peptides, which are generated by hydrolytic processing of MBP and PLP, have been shown to have pathogenic potential in experimental animals and are immunogenic in multiple sclerosis patients. Thus far, no experimental model has been identified that is suitable to predict efficacy of candidate drugs directed against multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the exact pathogenesis in multiple sclerosis at the cellular and molecular level is not known. We have developed a new experimental model, where Lewis rats are actively sensitized to MBP. Induced immune responses mimic very closely those observed in multiple sclerosis patients, and the disease was fully reversible with immunosuppressive drugs. We have investigated the effects of the novel immunosuppressive agent, FK\u2010506, together with those of cyclophosphamid for their ability to reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

What is the role of classifiers such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines in data science?   \n\nWhen working with data, we want to find insights and derive knowledge that will then help us make better decisions. Data science is the field of study found at the intersection of data, statistical models and machine learning methods. In the era of big data (a large and complex set of data), we want to develop robust predictive models to provide the ability to handle such data and build a better picture of it. \n\nSome predictor variables have to be transformed to be used as inputs of a predictive model. Some values from the variables do not make sense for the model. For example, values around two are considered to be outliers for predicting a body mass index (BMI). We transform variables to make their values more in line with data analysis. Some predictors are categorical variables. To make them understandable for the model, they are represented with a number. To calculate a numeric value for the categorical data, one can use a dummy encoding technique where it is converted into zero for the first category and one for other category. It works like assigning a value as (number for first category) and (number for another category). \n\nWe can choose a regression (statistical model, to predict the value of an outcome variable), classifier (a machine learning model), or a clustering model, if we have a categorical outcome. In case the response is categorical, classification and regression models can be used. If the response is numerical and the variables are numerical then regression models are used. On the other hand, if the variables are categorical but the response is numerical, we can use classification models. In this case, the categorical response is categorized into groups and the model will predict the values.   \n#### Support Vector Machine:\n- The best-known and widely used approach in machine learning, also called a support vector classifier or support vector machine is a supervised learning approach that is used to categorize data and can be used to generate the binary classification. It is a binary classifier used to classify data points with only two classes. It also assigns weights to the two classes, where the maximum weight is equal to the maximum loss or the sum of the class error. This is known as a cost function. Each point has a specific weight assigned. The cost",

Here, we review all reintroductions published for amphibians and reptiles undertaken by 13 European Union member states in the last five decades, and evaluate the success of the programs. To identify general attributes of successful versus unsuccessful reintroductions we first searched the scientific literature for species with previous successful and failed reintroductions, then gathered information on the reintroduction program. Across the 27 reintroductions of amphibians, 20 are ongoing, and in five species the populations have recovered to numbers or densities similar to those present before their declines (five species are extinct in the wild). In contrast, only four of 17 of amphibian reintroductions have been considered successes, although another three populations appear to be at least recovering. Among reptiles, the two reintroductions of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) considered successful are both ongoing; the two reintroductions of the threatened Spur-thighed Tortoise ( Testudo graeca ) had variable success, and at least one of the three reintroductions for Spiny-tailed agama (Stellagama stellio) may be close to extinction. Across all amphibians and reptiles, some key attributes of reintroduction success were low numbers of introduced individuals, low stocking densities, high quality habitat of the release site, avoidance of large stressors like predators, absence of conspecific competition, and avoidance of inbreeding through selection of diverse founders. Most successful reintroductions were based on captive-bred individuals",

The cells, from which the glyceraldehyde had been removed, continued to divide in a medium containing glycerol or glucose when cultured on gelatin-coated glass cover-slips. Suppression of cell division by glyceraldehyde was seen even when the growth medium was completely changed on a daily basis. Suppression was not produced by glyceraldehyde phosphate in the absence of magnesium ions. However, a toxic effect was produced in these cells only in the presence of magnesium ions. Glyceraldehyde inhibited pyruvate kinase, glutamic dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-glycerophosphate oxidase. In Ehrlich ascites tumour ceils inoculated into normal mice the specific activity of these enzymes was reduced; with glyceraldehyde treatment, however, the enzymic activities were increased, approaching the control values in some cases.

You are an expert in assessing patient's eligibility to participate in clinical trial. You are now given a clinical trial note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal.

But these studies have not looked at the way different racial backgrounds can affect the way the blood forms clots. Minorities, such as African-Americans are underrepresented. Therefore, we are conducting this platelet reactivity study to better understand if there are differences in how this drug affects African-Americans from how they affect Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving ticagrelor. These data will be compared to a historical control of Caucasian patients who underwent similar platelet function testing.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nFemale (post menopausal or surgically sterile",

Escherichia coli metabolizes m-aminobenzoic acid (m-ABA) via two pathways, one dependent on oxygen uptake and the other inactive in the anaerobic phase of growth.\n2. Treatment of E. coli with cysteine results in a change of the ratio between the activities of these two pathways; m-ABA assimilation rate increases.\n3. This effect of cysteine is accompanied by a depletion of the m-ABA reductase and by a partial inhibition of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of the latter compound.\n4. Both the m-ABA reductase and the aminotransferase activity of E. coli are stimulated by L-methionine and 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid.\n5. Inhibition of the m-ABA reductase seems to be due to changes in the concentrations of the two substrates of the enzyme: the formation of \u03b3-glutamic acid and the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of the latter compound.<EOD> .\nBrucellae have two peaks of growth (stationary phases); late logarithmic phase (6th hour) and early stationary phase (8th hour).

We compared patients who were in persistent MR (persMR) versus those who were not (by 1-, 2-, and 3-year landmark intervals) to demonstrate time to persMR. The results indicate that age, gender, Sokal prediction or Sokal prediction status (negative or positive), presence of baseline BCR/ABL positive cells, and BCR/ABL transcript at <10% were not associated with persMR achievement when assessed as a univariate or multivariate analysis. Persistence of MR was not associated with BCR/ABL fusion transcript type, and a cytogenetic response to treatment was found in 83% with MR. These data can be used to design future studies on whether other patients with CML are able to achieve persistent MR.Clinical trials have indicated that most patients treated with imatinib mesylate (IM) can achieve a CCyR, which was found to be the most important predictor of achieving long-term remissions 1-3 .

As the markers for changes in protein synthesis, the accumulation of intracellular RNA and cytotoxic action, the morphological state of the cells during incubation was estimated. The obtained data testify to the presence of a number of specific processes in tumour cell cultures which are the cause of changes in the cell phenotype. The mechanism of the cytotoxic action of R-2431, R-2428 and R-2394 is proposed. With the use of microcalorimetry and fluorescent probes, heat and the degree of membrane fluidity changes in the cells of the control culture were detected. These changes were manifested as an increase in the rate of protein synthesis, accompanied by the formation of heat and an elevated level of fluorescence of the NBD probe. All the three investigated compounds caused a diminution of the synthesis rate of membrane protein and heat production, and increased the level of fluorescence of the probe, which testified to cytotoxicity being a manifestation of the damage to the membrane structure. It is not excluded that the pesticides under study exert their cytotoxic action by damaging the membrane and disruption of the cytoskeleton of tumour cells. Damage to the cell membranes and a change in the cytoskeleton may be related to the disruptions in metabolic processes, a decrease in the rate of energy metabolism and the decrease in protein and DNA synthesis, which are observed during tumour cell incubation with the above-mentioned compounds.<EOD> Correction to: Developmental changes in functional connectivity are more variable in autism than in typical development\n\nC O R R E C T",

This increases risk of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.~LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance are present.~Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform noninvasive tests to measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.~This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAged 18 years or over\nParticipant willing and able to give informed consent.\nDocumented Ischaemic Heart Disease: either angio-graphically documented coronary artery disease or a previous history of myocardial infarction/angina.\nScreening echocardiography based diagnosis of LVH",

Currently, gene screening can be applied for the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, of which polymerase chain reaction-sequencing methods are widely used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new method for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of familial hypercholesterolemia based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Materials and Methods: Four familial hypercholesterolemia-affected families from two provinces were recruited via the PGD database. Ovarian matured oocytes were retrieved from patients and subjected to vitrification and warming. A rapid freeze-all strategy was used to freeze and thaw embryos. Embryos were fixed for chromosome analysis and then transferred to the microplate for PGD screening. Genomic DNA isolated from the patients' leukocytes, their partners, their embryos, and the oocytes was subjected to NGS library construction based on amplified whole exons of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. Results: Among the four selected cases, three resulted in positive findings for the familial hypercholesterolemia-affected embryos and one resulted in negative findings. All blastocysts of the negative cases underwent assisted hatching. We observed no blastocyst development and hatching ability of the negative cases. For the positive cases, seven patients achieved successful clinical pregnancies through the transfer of PGD-confirmed embryos with no familial hypercholesterolemia genetic defect.

Despite evidence that COVID-19 pandemic has decreased pet ownership and pet contact, its effect on attitudes towards the human-animal bond remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically review and synthetically appraise evidence on changes in public attitudes towards the human-animal bond during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest were searched for eligible studies published between 1 January 2020 and 29 February 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statements were used. Studies were screened, and quality was assessed using the QualSyst appraisal tool. Qualitative synthesis of findings was performed according to a standardized method described by Pluye and Goulet (2018).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNineteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Study quality was appraised as being good. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced attitudes towards the human-animal bond in different ways, including more dog ownership and human pet contact, greater fear of cross infection, and lower tolerance of dog behavior as a result of the pandemic. Fear of cross infection was mainly reported in studies using web surveys, whereas studies relying on social media for data obtained had no information about the sample's characteristics or data collection method. Differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human attitudes towards the human-animal bond as a result of changes in dog ownership, pet contact, cross infection fear and tolerance of dog behavior could not be demonstrated due to high heterogeneity among studies",

The main specific research questions were whether genetic factors could explain the familial aggregation of drinking behavior in middle-aged Finnish men and, second, whether alcohol dependence and alcohol-related problems are more strongly associated with each other than with individual or joint influence of genetic and non-shared environmental factors in this Finnish population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree thousand eight hundred nine Finnish families consisting of biological fathers and sons were screened for alcohol-related problems using the AUDIT (alcohol use disorders identification test) instrument. Genetic contributions to familial aggregation were estimated using biometric model-fitting analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the fathers (n = 3809) and sons (n = 3809) was 43 years (median = 42) and 22 years (median = 21) respectively. According to the genetic epidemiological findings, the mean number of problem drinking symptoms (DSM IV) of the fathers was 1.1 (95% confidence interval  = 0.9 to 1.3) symptoms. The genetic influence on drinking problems was, however, statistically non-significant. Environmental contribution to shared variance was substantial for AUDIT-A, while non-shared variance was large for AUDIT-C and for total AUDIT score. Intra-class correlations were modest (0.05-0.24).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetic contribution to AUDIT was rather small and it had no direct effect on alcohol-related problems. The high nonshared environmental variance for AUDIT-A (alcohol intake) indicates that alcohol consumption of biological fathers and sons is not likely to be correlated because of shared environmental risk factors. The results also suggest that there are large individual and family environmental differences in AUDIT-A (alcohol intake) and AUDIT-",

Use the following algorithm.  \nHere is a patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American women presents to the ER with episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that began two days earlier for the first time in her life. The pain started while she was walking, radiates to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis and mild dyspnea, but is not increased on inspiration. The latest episode of pain ended half an hour prior to her arrival. She is known to have hypertension and obesity. She denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or a family history of heart disease. She currently takes no medications. Physical examination is normal. The EKG shows nonspecific changes.\n\nNext, you should get the output of the trial-level eligibility for this clinical trial based only on the patient notes, including this patient note. You have to decide which factors (the inclusion criteria) will be sufficient to assess this one patient.  \nHere is the patient note:\nA 58-year-old African-American woman presen to the ER with epis",

We have performed experiments using several known platelet agonists and platelet antagonists. This test accurately provides reproducible whole blood platelet aggregation results.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe evaluation of platelet function has been limited to platelet-poor plasma or platelet-rich plasm due to the laborious handling of platelets. In this study, we developed a novel method for whole blood aggregometry, a technique useful in clinical settings.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used an in vitro flow aggregometer system, combined with platelet rich plasma (PRP), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe novel technique resulted consistent and reproducible platelet aggregation readings. Although collagen and thrombin reproduced the results of platelet aggregometry in PRP, prostaglandin I2 showed lower platelet reactivity in whole blood, which suggests that other blood elements (e.g., red blood cells, thrombocytopenia, or plasma components) interfere with platelet aggregation. By using antiplatelet agents in the new system, we observed significant differences between low-dose ASA and cilostazol, and between high-dose ASA and apixaban.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo the best of our knowledge, we first achieved flow platelet aggregometry in whole blood. The use of whole blood can be useful for preclinical evaluations and the screening of new compounds in the future.<EOD> Correction to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\n\nCorrection to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\nPublished online: 18 November 2019Correction to: Gamma Delta T Cells From Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Are Highly Sensitive and Specific to Clinically Relevant Antigens\nPublished online:",

        "output": "## Summary \nLet's summarize this tutorial about Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Prolog in Prolog works by breaking problems down into smaller pieces.\n\nThis tutorial is intended to introduce readers to the programming language of Prolog and how to solve problems in clinical NLP. There is a very good Prolog guidebook available at https://book.swi-prolog.org/structure/intro.html\n\nWhat is Prolog? \nProlog is also known as a logical language of programs and logic programming. It was invented by Alain Colmeret in 1970 in France and licensed in 1972 by Allen Newell and his research team under the name Logic Programming Systems, Inc. (LPS). It became very popular in computer science and AI as a logic programming language.\n\nWhat is Prolog in Prolog is a declarative language while other programming languages such as C++, C#, or Python are imperative programming languages. It is often said that Prolog is a declarative language because its statement explains the result rather than the way of achievement. In Prolog, a query is a logical form, usually represented in the form of a question. Here is a sample Prolog query, e.g., `?-Turtle is a frog`. This is similar to SQL's WHERE query. Prolog has the advantage of being able to retrieve results with only a query without any programming. It will return any answer that satisfies the query, not the only one that is expected. [/SUM]\n\n## Installing Prolog in the Linux System \nTo install the Prolog programming language (http://www.swi-prolog.org/), you need to install Swi-Prolog (http://www.swi-prolog.org/). This will require you to have already installed the GNU source distribution system and the Linux package management system.\n\nTo start the installation of Swi-Prolog, first go to the SwiProlog website (http://www.swi-prolog.org/). Then click the link to `Download source`. Swi-Prolog is open source and has an official repository. There are two versions available, including Swi-Prolog 6.0 and Swi-Prolog 5.6.

We would like to clarify that the purpose of the research was to evaluate the use of routine ultrasound scans for the study of the uteroplacental interface with regard to the presence of subplacental hypervascularity. Although a relationship between sub-chorionic hypervascularity and histological chorionic villi hypotrophy has been reported in previous research, this was not the reason for our research. Sub-chorionic hypervascularity (hypervascularity) is a frequent appearance on second trimester ultrasound and is related to feto-placental haemodynamics.\nFurthermore, as our research took place in the UK, we included only obstetric ultrasound scans between 18 and 24 weeks from pregnant women aged between 18 and 34 years old who were not suffering from any of the following conditions: any congenital illness, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac illness, renal problems, obesity (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ), blood group 0, or family history of inherited thrombophilia. We included women if they voluntarily signed informed consent to take part in the project.\nWe agree that the results of our research are valid, and for this reason we are grateful to those who raised this issue. Our results on a subgroup of 60 women should definitely be replicated in a wider study to confirm this association.\nI hope that you and your readers and readers will understand why we chose to refer to the results of the research as \"findings\" and not \"results\", because the results of our research were not able to show a statistically significant relationship with the appearance of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm labour, preterm delivery and pre-eclampsia.\nI would like to thank Dr Zampieri (and the other reviewers and the Editor in chief) for raising this point, which we consider very important, and we agree with these comments. I have now sent a revised manuscript entitled\" Sub-chorionic hypervascularity predicts the occurrence",

For example, to evaluate heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pupils size, skin color, etc.\n- Diagnostic tests; Diagnostic tests help the doctors to understand and confirm the diagnosis. Some common diagnostic tests may involve simple lab tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, etc.\n- Differential diagnosis; Once all the data gathered, the doctor should have a list of possible diseases that can affect the patient\u2019s condition. At this point, the doctor looks for possible answers with a method in which all other possible disease is eliminated by the current signs / symptoms and patient\u2019s medical record, and finally reaches a diagnosis based on the available evidence.\n- Treatment plan; The most important step, finally determines how much care patients should receive.\n- Conclusion statement and prognosis; The doctor concludes the visit based on his diagnostic workup, and explains the prognosis.\nThis page is the place for you to add the steps required in collecting data and making a diagnosis. You should complete this page as if you were a real doctor.

By employing the high-resolution fura-2 method, the effect of titanium on calcium-dependent activity of Saos-2 cells has been examined. Results show that exposure to titanium caused both a significant rise in basal intracellular calcium (Ca++) (p < 0.01) and a spike in i, indicating that such stimulation may alter the normal cytosolic biochemistry of osteoblasts in vitro and perhaps be involved in osteoblanic development. The two endothelial cells strains have also been investigated. Both titanium at 0.002%, 0.02% and 0.1% and calcium nitrate (CN; negative control) elicit a positive response in i, as measured by fura-2, of human endothelial cells (HUV EC) or a human umbilical vein endothelial cell strain (HMA 2.1). In contrast, human bone endothelial cells (HBM EC) exposed to titanium did not demonstrate a significant change in oi compared to control. There was, however a significant rise in oi when titanium was used in the presence of HEPES buffer, but not in Eagle's balanced salts or Ca-free buffers. It is suggested that the ability of endothelial cells to react may show differences, and that the effect of titanium may be related to ion buffering capabilities.<EOD> .\nThe authors evaluated the effectiveness of the combined therapy consisting of bifonazol, gliclazider, hydrophilic vasodil",

Ischemic damage is irreversible and is often unpredictable. Under ischemic damage conditions, cellular metabolic activities are depleted. In recent years, hysteretic mechanisms were explored to protect ischemic events, which included two major mechanisms including neuroprotective preconditioning of ischemia followed by ischemic tolerance or postconditioning protection. The most common pharmacological stimulus and/or ischemic conditioning for ischemic tolerance has been pharmacological postconditioning. Postconditioning is accomplished by several drug or ischemic insults that interrupt prolonged ischemia or reperfusion after ischemic/reperfusion injury followed by reperfusion (10). Ischemic tolerance has been defined as brief, repetitive cycles of ischemic/reperfusion, which can confer resistance to a subsequent severe prolonged ischemic insult. Ischemic pre-conditioning is defined as brief cycles of ischemic, which have been demonstrated to be protective against ischemic cellular injury in animal models and clinical evidence has not been established yet.<EOD> Intra\u2010arterial verapamil during transplantation\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to describe a strategy for the prevention of graft spasm after clinical liver transplantation that avoids the use of vasodilator medication.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFive consecutive adult patients underwent transplantation with intra-arterial infusion of verapamil (6-30 mg) during the anhepatic phase.

The use of a 7.5 MHz radial echoendoscope was first described in 1982 . Conventional EUS consists of an endoscope with two perpendicular balloon-mounted electronic transducers at the tip of the endoscope. More recently, a radial echoendoscope has also been marketed. These endoscopes provide a circumferential view of all layers of the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier to evaluate tumors at risk of malignancy. The echoendoscope is usually advanced through the working channel of a regular endoscope and can be used to acquire high-resolution images of the layers of the gastrointestinal tract, up to 15 cm from the endoscope transducer. With advances in computer technology, a new type of endosonographic imaging that uses a special dedicated endoscope is under development. <EOD> .\nThe review deals with some peculiarities of the functional status of blood system in patients with acute cerebral circulation disorders of vascular genesis.

While the apical bronchocentrics are in the stage of dissolution, the bronchiectasis remains in the same state. These bronchiectatic cavities are lined by thickened bronchial mucous membrane with a scantier layer of columnar and cubical cells. There is a slight exuda tion of lymphocytes in the serous mucosa between the cubical epithelial cells, the interstitial tissue is more abundant than in the apical involuted stage, and a certain number of granulocytes are present throughout.

This phenomenon is prevalent in perinatal brain damage, which also produces an impaired oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation. C1qTNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1) is implicated in promoting cell survival during cell stress. We therefore studied whether CTRP1 also promotes OL precursor (OP) cell survival under low oxygen tension, which may be important for their survival in the early stages of brain development and for their maturation during their migration. Our study revealed that 1) OL lineage cells upregulate CTRP1 expression in response to hypoxia in vitro; 2) recombinant human (rh) CTRP1 was able to protect OPs from oxidative stress; and 3) rh CTRP1 promoted OP survival under oxygen deprivation by reducing cell death and by arresting cell cycle. These data reveal the potential of CTRP1 to mediate oxidative stress, thus contributing to the survival of OPs under low oxygen tension, which is a necessary condition to be involved in the maturation of these cells.<EOD> The role of surgery and radiation therapy in the treatment of mucous membrane pemphigoid: Review of the literature\n\nBackground: Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a rare, immunemediated mucosal disorder, and its clinical presentation can be variable.

All the examinees received different regimens of insulin therapy. The basal serum level of C-peptide in the patients was decreased 77% in relation to control and the basal insulin excretion in patients with IDD was 2.5-fold reduced. The secretion of immunoreactive C-peptide rose during oral tolerance test in response to carbohydrate loading but diminished in 8 patients within 24 hrs after intravenous glucose load test. Injection of tolbutamide (250 mg) induced hyperglycemia and reduced serum C-peptide levels in insulin dependent diabetics. In 7 of patients with IDD, serum C-peptide level diminished after administration of insulin, while in 6 examinees the concentrations of C-peptide remained unchanged during insulin injection. In the patients treated with intermediate acting insulin no relation between C-peptide and insulin levels in fasting state was seen. These data seem to indicate that disturbances in insulin secretion have polyetiological genesis. A long-term glucose loading test, a 24-hr serum C-peptide assay and immunoreactive C-peptide measurements during insulin administration are recommended for evaluation of insulin production in diabetics, as well as for differential diagnosis of IDD and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<EOD> Numerical Prediction of Tear Resistance of Bio-Based Bio-Poly(P",

Patients with diabetes are 22 times more likely to have foot ulceration or gangrene than nondiabetics, while foot ulceration precedes 85% of lower-extremity amputation. Three factors combine to promote tissue necrosis in diabetic feet: ischemia, neuropathy, and trauma. Among them, ischemia peripheral arterial disease may play the important roles in the development of DFU. Moreover, diffuse vascular disease is the main characteristics, and thus it becomes difficult for treatment by using arterial bypass or balloon angioplasty. Therefore, we hypothesized that continuous arterial thrombolysis may be an effective therapy in diabetic foot. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of continuous intra-femoral artery injection of urokinase by micro-artery-pump in diabetic ulcers.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\ndiabetic foot ulcer\n< = 80 years old\ndiabetic foot ulcer stage 2-4\nIschemic necrosis with ischemic area> 1/3 in both front and rear of foot\n\nFinally, you should always repeat trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly",

Although pigs are frequently raised as companion animals by humans, they are primarily farm animals. The domestication of pigs about 8,000 years ago has been accompanied by selection of breeds for size, feed conversation, and meat and fat production. Pig is a common domestic animal in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere and as such they are frequently exposed to human pathogens and human-introduced tumour agents, especially cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma caused by the human papilloma virus. As a result, a variety of pig cancers have been reported in the past five decades. However, the pig is still a rare animal to present to the medical oncologist! This paper reviews the literature on pig neoplasms in English language journals from 1958 to 2006 (i.e., 49 years). It summarizes the incidence of neoplasms found in domestic pigs including those in the wild as well as the more exotic miniature swine species. It also provides a discussion of recent developments in molecular pathogenesis of tumorigenesis in these animals. Aspects include the molecular characteristics of pig cancer biology and the utility of the domestic pig as a model for human cancer and to test new therapeutic drugs and devices. The use of immune-competent pigs to test new cancer vaccines is briefly reviewed.\nIt has been 50 years since the first pig neoplasms 1 and 40 years since the first genetic neoplasia in pigs was reported 2 in the English language literature. Although most of these reports are rather dated, a number of cases of pig neoplasms are still found today",

Many individuals with established NASH can be identified at an early stage and treated according to the current evidence-based recommendations. As the majority of such patients will not proceed to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, several ongoing efforts are directed towards development of specific pharmacodynamic therapies targeting the underlying fatty liver pathogenesis. A key pathway affected by metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes is the bile acid (BA) signaling, orchestrated by the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and the activation of BA transport protein OATP1B1 in the liver. Indeed, elevated BA concentrations in serum (e.g., induced by increased hepatic synthesis of primary BAs, diminished hepatic uptake of secondary BAs or increased enterohepatic BA circulation) have been suggested to be causative in the initiation and perpetuation of NASH progression. It is interesting to note that mice with combined FXR- and ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) deficiency, i.e., the combined reduction of these pathways, developed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as early as 4 weeks of age. Intriguingly, liver lipids in this model could be reversed by feeding of high-fat diet with cholic acid instead of cholate, while hepatic inflammation and fibrosis were not attenuated, as observed in a previous experimental model. In addition, a combined FXR- and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19)-deficient transgenic mouse resulted in more pronounced hepatic steatosis than the individual deficits per se. Hepatocytes with BA-induced lipotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis were less responsive to FGF19 ther",

Studies of language switching in simultaneous interpreters are still lacking, particularly from the perspective of eye-tracking technology. In this study, bilingual Mandarin speakers who have also completed intensive interpreting training were recruited and instructed to speak in either their native language (A1) or their second language (L2), while their eye movements were recorded using a Tobii TX300. After data preprocessing and cleaning, a total of 448 sets of data were obtained. Three experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between switching costs (1) of the direction of language and switch type, (2) between the direction of language and switch type, and (3) switch type, respectively. The results showed that both the direction of language and switch type had an effect on the switching costs. The eye movement data revealed a significant difference in gazing time and fixation counts between languages, indicating that when interpreters switched from L2 to A1, they needed significantly more cognitive resources. Moreover, the switch type, i.e., backward or forward, had a marked effect on switch costs. In the backward condition, a larger switch cost occurred, and interpreters spent more time reading the target sentence to extract information and process it. These findings have implications for theory construction and provide further insight into the process and characteristics of language switching in simultaneous interpreters using eye-tracking technology.\n\n## Research motivation\nResearching the mechanism underlying language switching in simultaneous interpreters is of great scientific importance. This study addressed the questions of whether language switching impacted switch speed, cognitive processing, and memory in L2, and whether there was a cognitive",

The prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome was higher in females than that in males for T2DM patients in this study; however, the data revealed that metabolic syndrome were more prevalent in males than in females among the T2DM without macroalbuminuria and without PAD. There are some confounders such as aging and gender to explain these inconsistent data. Some studies demonstrated that males generally exhibit higher levels of insulin resistance, while females demonstrate higher levels of insulin sensitivity. These studies hypothesize that this trend may be due to the protective effects of female sex in T2DM patients. There were significantly higher insulin levels and HOMA-IR in males than in females in the three groups of T2DM patients in this study. The mean HOMA-IR level was higher in females than the levels in males among the T2DM patients without macroalbuminuria and without PAD, but there were no significant differences in HOMA-IR levels in the three groups of T2DM patients. The level of serum insulin indicates the degree of insulin resistance. The insulin levels and HOMA-IR levels did not show any sexrelated differences in T2DM patients in three groups with macroalbuminuria PAD or without macroalbuminuria and without PAD. The higher HOMA-IR levels in males than in females in three groups of T2DM patients in this study imply that the males with T2DM are more insulin resistant than their female counterparts. These results suggest that insulin resistance may be a potential cardio-protective risk factor in male adults.\n\n## Effect of epa on vascular stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes: a feasibility study\nChien-Yu Chen, 1 Chih-Chung Hsieh,",

Data about the correlation between BNP and congestive acute heart failure (AHF) are lacking. Therefore, it was our primary aim to study relations between BNP and severity of AHF. Moreover, we intended to search for correlations between BNP, serum potassium (K), and blood glucose (BG), and to evaluate the value of BNP as a marker for clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic remission at discharge.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 77 CHF patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were strong correlations between BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (rho=0.83, p<0.0001), and BNP and left ventricular (LV) mass index (r=0.58, p<0.0001). BNP correlated more favorably with LVEF and LV mass index in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) than in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. The mean BNP levels were higher in NYHA IV than in NYHA II/III patients. BNP correlated with serum creatinine (r=0.349, p=0.004). BNP levels decreased in 64 patients. The decrease was not statistically more marked in ischemic patients (ICM), probably due to the higher mortality (ICM 21%, DCM 9%. BNP levels were higher in patients with lower K levels and lower in patients with lower BG levels. BNP was positively correlated with C-reactive protein (r=0.295, p=0.008) and left ventricular diastolic pressure (r=0.272, p=0.012). The remission of some parameters was more obvious in NYHA I/II than in NYHA III(",

Therefore, we may conclude that valproic acid affects histones indirectly through HDACi.\n\n##### Reference\nKawada, A., Watanabe, K., Murata, S., Nakazawa, B., Ishiyama, R., Kobayashi, H., Yonemoto, Y., Yamanaka, O., Shimada, K., & Onozato, M.

Cancer research, 65(5), 1625-31.\n\n\n### Answer 3\nThe first treatment option for breast cancer patients is surgery. The choice of surgical method is determined by many factors. Therefore, surgery is performed by taking into account all these conditions. For example, axillary lymph node dissection must be performed for patients with clinical node positive breast cancer. Radiation therapy is used to prevent recurrence of the cancer and to reduce the risk of developing a second primary cancer. Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, in which cytotoxic drugs are given to shrink the tumor size before surgery, is also widely used with patients with large breast tumors that are more likely to cause serious problems if left untreated. Endocrine therapy is recommended in patients with oestrogen positive (ER+ ) and/or progesterone positive (PR+ ) tumours, except for those who have breast cancer that is triple negative or HER2 positive. Targeted drug therapy is recommended only when the cancer has HER2 amplification. Targeted therapies interfere with specific proteins (such as HER",

PV anatomy and pulmonary vein (PV) flow patterns have recently been reported as predictors of PV stenosis. Here we aimed to quantify PV flow and assess the use of pre-PVI pulmonary artery peak diastolic gradients to predict post-PVI PV flow patterns. Methods Fifty-eight patients undergoing PVI were prospectively recruited. Each patient had pre-pulmonary vein (PV) and pre-ablation (postpulmonary vein isolation; PVI) pulmonary artery peak diastolic gradients obtained. Doppler flow assessment and peak diastolic gradients immediately distal to the isolated and unablated PVs within 2 months of the procedure were evaluated. Results A total of 57 patients were recruited who had pre-PV and pre-PVI flow assessments. Mean diastolic gradients pre-PV (11.4 mm Hg) were lower than post-PVI gradients (16.2 mm Hg) and lower than pre-PVI assessments in patients who developed occluded flow patterns (23.3 mm Hg). There was no relationship between post-PVI Doppler parameters and pre-PVI pulmonary artery gradients. Conclusions This is the first data set to quantify pre-PVI Doppler flow parameters. The assessment of PV flow may allow PVI to be used to predict which PVs will lose flow post PVI. In cases where diastolic gradients are abnormally high PV stenting may be indicated and/or a careful reassessment should take place prior to PVI.<EOD> Phase I, Isobolographic, and Biologic Study of a High Antigen Dose of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin in a Murine Model of Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis\nPurpose: To evaluate the safety",

We observed melanocytic nevus (MN) using digital dermoscopic images and demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel mechanistic design approach for sunscreens to overcome the inherent difficulty for sunscreens to adhere to the skin. The skin was divided into four quadrants (Qs), and the average skin-adherent degree (SAD) of sunscreens, that is, the average ratio of sunscreen area on a quadrant after washing to before washing, was evaluated with a formula we developed using digital dermoscopic images of MN. As the SAD reflects the amount of skin-adherent sunscreen, the higher the SAD, the better the sunscreen adhesion. In all ten subjects, we found no significant differences in SAD between Q1 and Q2 to obtain an adequate amount of sunscreen even in the skin on which sunscreen was difficult to adhere. The novel mechanistic design approach will aid in the development of sunscreens with good adherence to the skin.<EOD> .\nThe content of serum albumins in 94 children with various renal diseases was measured by the quantitative immunodiffusion method with antianalbumins of different specificities.

You are an underground call center worker and you are required to answer 1000 calls a day. When people call you, your task is to determine on average how long will it take to respond to an individual call and then you have to estimate call duration. If not, you will receive deduction. The call duration is calculated by considering multiple variables. In order for you to improve your performance, let's predict some of these variables that have the highest contributions to the phone calls.\n\nLet's think the following variables:\n- Phone number\n- Calls from mobile\n- Answered by the same agent\n- Calls from women\n- Calls made on non-work days\n- Calls concerning non-medical\n- Agent's experience level\n- Calls made with English language - Agent's language proficiency\n- Agent's call center experience\n\nWe will try to estimate the call duration variables by learning the best features. Here is the process:\n\n- We formulate our learning question as a regressor model with the target variable _Call duration_. You can specify the dataset in the cell under the variable call duration, e.g., call_duration: 'calls'.\n- We define the dependent variable and the target column in the cells of call duration, e.g., call_duration: 'calls duration', call_duration_target: 'calls duration target'.\n- The model parameters are set as follows:\n  - We will use Logit regression with the call duration variable 'calls'.\n  - We assume that the model with parameters _Calls_ will have the best accuracy. That is, we are training 3 models: Ridge regression, Lasso, and Elasticnet models with _Calls_ parameter.\n\nThe following cells under the variable [Ridge regression], [Lasso regression], and [ElasticNet regression] show the results:\n- We need to compare the effectiveness of three models using the RMSE and R2 scores of those models, e.g., elasticNet: 'RMSE', elasticNet: 'R2', lasso: 'RMSE', lasso: 'R2', ridge: 'RMSE', ridge:",

We measure the cross-entropy loss over the labels `1: Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; 2: Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.` and the prediction probabilities of the network. For a particular epoch, the overall cross-entropy loss L CE on the whole dataset `D` is calculated by:\n \n    \\[L CE = 1 |D| \\sum _{c \\in D} \\log( p_s^{c})\\]\nwhere ${p}_s$ is the scale of the patient for the assessment of eligibility to the clinical trial. The prediction output of the network is a discrete distribution, and usually it is in the form of a vector in the range of 0 to 1. In this case, the calculation of the loss function is to logarithmize the distribution and find its expectation value. And since the summation operation tends to overestimate the weight for a certain data point in the same label, we use a weighted cross-entropy form to alleviate that.\n\nNow, we calculate the loss over the whole dataset, we show the cross-entropy loss on the validation set when using different settings of the trial-level eligibility loss. We can see a continuous decrease of loss when adding the trial-level eligibility loss. So we want to continue training the network until it reaches the bottom.\n\n![Evaluate-loss](./img/Evaluate-loss.png)\n\n```{note}\n\tNote: The loss is the cross-entropy loss on the validation set, and the training is done as usual.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the following electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, Scopus, Social Services Abstracts, Google Scholar, and Dissertations Abstract International Theses. Results: Thirteen peer-reviewed journals articles were included in the systematic review. A variety of oral health conditions were considered as dependent variables but the number of studies evaluating each specific disease or condition was limited. Evaluations of specific diseases with limited evidence for adolescents in the United States included gingivitis, dental caries, periodontal disease, and traumatic dental injury (TDI). Discussion: Although dental caries and TDI were reported to be more prevalent among adolescents compared to adults, there was less evidence on the impact of oral health on oral health-related quality of life among adolescents compared to adults. There is an urgent need for longitudinal studies with a prospective design and large sample that could examine the impact of specific dental conditions on different aspects of oral health-related quality of life.\n\n# Background\nThe concept of oral health was defined by the United Kingdom's National Health Service in 2003 as, \"a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" . In 2004, the World Health organization (WHO) followed suit, by defining oral health as the, \"absence of disease or disorder, injury or impairment including pain of oral or paraoral structures, as well as problems relating to personal oral hygiene, and esthetics affecting psychological wellbeing. It also refers to conditions of periodontium i.e. supporting structures of teeth, and their relationship with other structures\" in the definition of oral health.

In the other series bacterial cultures of the entire suction-tip surfaces were made by inserting an agar tip onto the entire surface, allowing the swab to absorb the bacteria and then cutting the portion of the swab with the agar tip on the surface. In 21 samples (95 per cent confidence interval 21 to 31 per cent) suction tips contaminated with S aureus were found by the rinse method and 100 per cent of tips were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli by the agar swab method.

Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy from 2003 to 2017 at 11 hospitals in South Korea were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Data from 220 patients were included; 63.7% of all patients had lung metastases, 14.5% had pleural dissemination, 46.6% had more than 3 metastatic foci, and 9.2% had pleural-only metastases. The median total tumor size was 4.2 cm (interquartile range, 1.2\u221211.1). In the thoracic metastasis group, the median survival time was 87 months (interquartile range, 67.6\u2212106.3) in patients with larger intrathoracic total tumor size (2.7 cm vs. 3.9 cm); the median survival time was significantly longer in the small-tumor group (\u22643.9 cm).

Crosstalk between Microbiota and Immune Cells: Significance for the Pathology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\n# Introduction\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract of multifactorial aetiology. Specifically, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue destruction in the intestine. IBD can arise after an inappropriate immune response to the commensal microbiota and is sustained by complex interactions between the external (environment) and internal (host) factors.\nTraditionally, a predisposing or protective role has been attributed to the environmental risk factors, however, recent studies have shed light on the important role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Notably, IBD patients have been characterized by a profound dysbiosis and an impairment in the commensal microbiota of the colonic mucosa. Gut microbiota is considered a key player in regulating immunological health because it maintains a fine balance between host-harmful and host-friendly microbes by shaping the host immune activity. Indeed, a large proportion of the body's immune system is found in the intestine, where it interacts with the microbiota present in the lumen. Thus, the maintenance and regulation of the intestinal ecosystem require the continuous dialogue of the host immune system with the microbiota.\nAlthough most IBD subtypes present an autoimmune phenotype, an increasing body of evidence is supporting the role of",

In other words, you want to provide some way to score the clinical trial using data contained in your \"patient note\".\nFrom What you provide, I believe to be the problem. You are wanting to be able to use the patient's age and the type of cancer to evaluate the trial. The patient's age and cancer should be easy to determine for most people, but the reason you are receiving a \"Not A-1\" is because your data entry is not accurate. You are not specifying the type of cancer in the patient \"note\" so you cannot evaluate it properly. One way to accomplish this could be to create and populate a clinicaltrials table to store patient eligibility related information. This information can then be used to score the trial-level eligibility and give a final score for each trial that you have available.\nWhat I would suggest, however, is to create a new table or create a new column in the clinicaltrials table to store the type of cancer.

In addition, based on your results, you are required to suggest a data-driven recommendation system for identifying ART nonadherence, which can be a valuable auxiliary tool for the doctors to reduce medical costs and ensure patients' health conditions. The region where you are currently working is a resource-poor part of China. Here is the patient registry from a local AIDS epicenter in Liaoning.\n\nThe data set includes three subsets: demographic features, treatment-related features, and symptom profiles. The goal of the analysis is to predict adherence to ART among HIV-positive people in this region. Patients who adhered to ART were identified by whether ART was present in the patient's medical record, and patients who did not adhered to ART were those whose ART was absent in the medical record. Patients had either a binary adherence-status (0/1 if ART was present) when the trial ended, or a right-censored observation (0/0 by default) meaning that we do not know whether they would adhere to treatment. The ART prescription, or the set of ART medicines, including at least 3 ART drugs, such as AZT, DDC, and NVP, was assigned to the treatment drug group and the ART regimen groups include the treatment drug and the symptom profiles within 30 days of HIV-positive diagnosis.\n\nYou are expected to conduct a systematic comparison and explain which features are informative to assess if patients adhere to HIV antiretroviral drug therapy. Consider features such as age, gender, symptoms, and ART regimen. Since we have both missing and right-censored outcomes, you can apply statistical",

Transdermal nitrate has gained widespread use following the development of nitrates by which the rate of elimination of active drug is reduced and side\u2010effects are minimised.

If using indexing, Python requires that you specify the size of the list with a positive integer. The first element of a list is `lis[0]`, the last element is `lis[-1]`.\n    * If you want to access the element in the middle of a list, like `lis[1]`, you can do a loop with an iterator index that starts at zero.\n    * Tuples do contain arbitrary objects like lists, and can be created using the `tuple()` constructor, e.g., `tu=tuple(\"Hello\", \"World\")`.\n    * Tuples support iterators, e.g., `x for varnames, vals in tu: print (varnames, val)`. \n    * It supports several methods including slice, subscript, or indexing to help the user to look inside its structure.\n    * It is not mutable.\n    ```python\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    from datetime import datetime\n    2 list\n    2 tuple\n    2 dicts\n    3 tuple-iterator\n    3 dataframe\n    3 dictionary\n    \n                        # Python 3\n                    print (\n                        \"hello\",\n                        \"world !\",\n                        end=\" \",\n                        sep=\"\\n\"\n                    )\n                    # Python 2\n                    print (\n                        \"Hello, \\tWorld! \\n\"\n                    )\n    ```\n\n* What",

Since little is known about immunological mechanisms, present study examines correlations between SIBO and immunoreactants. Materials and methods: This investigation took place at Taleghani Hospital, affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Serum samples of 35 UC patients and 16 healthy age-and sex-matched controls were examined to detect SIBO by means of the glucose hydrogen test. Serum IgG and IgM levels, as well as serum interleukin-6, were evaluated in patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: SIBO is more common in patients (20%) than in controls (7%). This bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is associated with higher level serum IgG (p=0.04) and IgM (p=0.003), but not serum interleukin-6. Conclusions: SIBO in patients can be a risk factor for immunoglobulin synthesis and overweight.\n\n# Introduction\nThe overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine was described by [bib_ref]  Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: diagnosis and treatment, Gasche [/bib_ref]  as a heterogeneous gastrointestinal disorder including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, characterized by increase in number and types of bacteria exceeding the norm of the gut.

Methods:Recent-drinkers were female emergency department attendees for whom recent alcohol and marijuana use was documented. Cut-off scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and Alcohol Smoking and Drinking with Drug Use Screening Test were used to identify frequent drinkers. Logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship of alcohol and SH use with injury. Results:Among 640 women, 199 (31.1%) reported drinking within the last 2 weeks and were included in the alcohol analyses. Overall, 29.1% reported drinking 2-7 drinks/week and 36.9% reported drinking 8+ drinks/week. The mean \u00b1 SD number of drinks consumed daily was 1.6 (95% confidence interval , 1.0, 2.2). The mean \u00b1 SD amount of SH pills/week was 8.7 (95% CI, 6.9, 10.4). The combination of alcohol use (8+ drinks/week) and SH medication use was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for injury of 2.64 (95% CI, 0.79, 8.43). The number of SH medication use days was also increased (OR = 2.22, 95% CI, 1.64, 2.89) but in the absence of alcohol use. In contrast the number of heavy drinking days was not related to injury. Conclusions:Combination of SH and alcohol use was related to injury while SH use alone was not. This finding may indicate increased risk of adverse consequences of alcohol among women who use SH medication, particularly when SH is not prescribed for treatment of alcohol addiction.<EOD> Effect of gastric surgery on serum pepsinogen levels in",

We have investigated the role of changes in oxygen supply on cell proliferation and maturation during regrowth of the ventral prostate by measuring the relative oxygen levels in the tissue at various time points using luminometry, and comparing them with changes in cell proliferation determined by autoradiography and histological assessments of cell differentiation. After short\u2010term exposure to the androgen, a temporary reduction has been observed in 02 supply despite an increase in blood flow. This is suggested to be due to an in situ vasoconstriction induced by an increase in nitric oxide after androgen administration. An uncoupling between blood flow and oxygen supply is evidenced by a concomitant blood oxygen decrement. Cell proliferation was transitorily induced by androgen as evidenced by an early and robust response, although it did not increase linearly over the studied period of 14 days. We show that the transient oxygen shortage that occurs during androgen administration inhibits cell proliferation and maturation. Consequently, a transit\u2010phase, during which cell proliferation is stimulated, can be followed by a phase in which",

The aim of the present work was to correlate this phenomenon with a specific functional variation in cerebellar lobules (anterior and posterior) by the evaluation of nitric oxide (NO) pathway activation. NO and cGMP levels after lesion are different in the two parts of the cerebellum, with the most evident NO increase in the anterior lobe and cGMP decrease in the damaged ipsi\u2010lateral posterior lobe. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnOc) and cyclic GMP\u2010mediated protein kinase (PKG) mRNA are more expressed in the posterior lobe, whereas NO level in the tissue increases after lesion. In both parts of the cerebellum, c\u2010fos mRNA and Fos protein\u2010like expression levels increase after lesion. The increase in c\u2010fos expression, detected in both lobes by in situ hybridization and Western blot, is greater in the anterior lobe. The results suggest an active role of NO during the cerebrocortical lesion, probably through regulation of nNOS, cyclic GMP, and/or Fos protein expression.<EOD> Characteristics and outcomes of women with obstetric fistula in four countries.\nUNLABELLED\nTHE AIM of the study was to describe the characteristics of women with obstetric fistula and determine outcomes after surgical repair.

The results show that there have been significant increases in referral of patients, the number of radiographic examinations and surgical interventions, but a decrease in the length of stay in hospital. Further, there appear to have been regional variations in management patterns, with special pleural clinics and surgical specialties being more widely employed in London than in the North or in Birmingham.<EOD> SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO3a and mediates its transcriptional activation in response to oxidative stress.\nSIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that is activated by cellular stress, metabolic insults, calorie restriction, and resveratrol. We observed that SIRT1 deacetylated a tumor suppressor and transcription factor, FOXO3a, in vitro. Overexpression of SIRT1 markedly attenuated oxidative stress-induced hyperacetylation and reduced FOXO3a binding to its response promoter elements. Furthermore, SIRT1 deacetylated endogenous FOXO3a in response to oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. The effects of SIRT1 on FOXO3a acetylation and FOXO3a-mediated transcription were abolished after lysine 64 mimics substitution. SIRT1 mediates the deacetylation of FOXO3a in vitro through interaction with its highly conserved N-terminal nuclear localization sequence motif. These observations indicate that SIRT1 may directly or indirectly affect the phosphorylation status of FOXO3a.<EOD> Effect of interleukin-10 promoter polymorphism on risk of tuberculosis in HLA DR2+ patients with diabetes mellitus\nAbstract Diabetes is a recognised risk factor for tuberculosis.

MethodsaaA total of 151 adults with ASD participated in this study. All subjects completed the demographic questionnaire, sexual functional checklist, 24-item HRQOL scale, depression anxiety stress scale, and Wender Utah rating scale. They also gave blood samples for thyroid function tests and a urine sample to test for antibodies against human gonadotropin related antigens. All items were evaluated separately and the data from these assessments were analyzed. ResultsaaMale subjects with ASD and hyperthyroidism or autoimmunity to gonadotropin hormones reported more negative sexual function compared to male subjects with ASD and intact hormones. Male subjects with comorbid hypothyroidism reported poorer HRQOL. No significant differences were observed in female subjects. ConclusionaaThe results of the present study indicate that clinicians should be aware of physical comorbidities and hormones disturbances and of the associations with sexual functions and HRQOL in adults with ASD.\n\n# Introduction\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social interaction deficits, difficulties with communication, and stereotyped and repetitive behavior.

Treatment with Amphotericin B intravenously (IV) followed by Candicillin G (IV) failed to improve their general condition. Therefore, in case no. 2 of leukocytopenia, adrenalectomy was performed before the second course of antifungal therapy. Five days later, in case no. 2, there was normalization of hemoglobin and white cell count and improvement of temperature. In case 3, adrenalectomy was performed immediately before the second course of antifungal therapy. This resulted in fever reduction and improvement of hemoglobin and white cell counts.

Cytogenetic abnormalities are detected in the majority of the patients and occur as unipolar and bipolar chromosomal aberrations. These cytogenetic abnormalities have not been systematically studied as a prognostic factor and their role in the prognosis is not well defined. For this evaluation, we analyzed the data of patients with CMML from two prospective multicenter trials. Patients on the trials underwent regular cytogenetic evaluation at diagnosis and were followed for survival and disease progression. We evaluated the effect of cytogenetic factors at the time of diagnosis: complexity of cytogenetic abnormality, blast excess, and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Over a median follow-up period of 15 months, 38% of patients transformed to AML. Patients with complex karyotype at diagnosis had lower probability of transformation to AML compared with patients with normal cytogenetics (P = 0.0258). There was no significant association between a complex cytogenetic profile and overall survival or cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation. A blast excess of 5% at baseline was also associated with a lower incidence of transformation to AML, but this observation did not survive correction for multiple testing (P = 0.0361) and did not improve other models of predicting leukemic transformation. Multivariate analysis showed that, in addition to the complex cytogenetic profile, there was an association between transfusion dependence and incidence of transformation to AML. Our findings suggest that patients with CMML with a predominance of monocytic precursors and normal cytogenetics at diagnosis have a lower probability to",

Smoking can cause numerous pathological changes, which can alter the therapeutic effect of antibiotic treatment as well. The objective of this study was to investigate whether cigarette smoking modulates antibiotic resistance in an in vivo mouse model of bacterial skin infection, and to analyze whether smoke exposure influences the kinetics and efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. Using Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa mouse skin infection models, we assessed whether passive smoking, during active treatment with cefazolin or tobramycin, reduced in vivo pharmacological activity of such antibiotics. Cigarette smoke exposure did not influence in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to cefazolin and tobramycin. Moreover, smoking-exposed mice displayed reduced S. pyogenes skin infection and were more susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection. Our findings show that cigarette smoke exposure causes a significant reduction in S. pyogenes infection as well as delayed wound healing, while promoting P. aeruginosa infection.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NOARG on the expression of HSP27 and HSP60 in Wistar rat kidneys. Bilateral renal artery occlusion (BRAO), lasting 5 min, was followed by 60 min of resuscitation. L-NOARG was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before BRAO. Animals were killed after 30 min reperfusion following BRAO, and immunostaining and Western blot were applied to evaluate the effect of endogenous NO on renal HSP27 and HSP60 expression. In control rats, HSP27 was expressed in the epithelial cells and HSP60 in the nucleus of the tubular epithelium. BRAO led to the loss of HSP60 and HSP27 expression. L-NOARG prior to BRAO suppressed HSP27 expression in the kidney when compared to the other experimental groups, but had no influence on HSP60 expression. In conclusion, endogenous NO synthase inhibition with l-NOARG resulted in the suppression of HSP27 expression in rat kidney.<EOD> Association of maternal depressive symptoms with the initiation of antenatal anxiety or depression in the first trimester and their relation with low birth weight in a population of Chinese women in Tianjin, China, 2011-2012.\nBACKGROUND\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the association of maternal depressive symptoms with the initiation of antenatal psychological anxiety and depressive disorders in the first trimester in a Chinese pregnant population and to explore the adverse effect of maternal psychological distress",

        "output": "<EOD> Effects of Catheter Size and Proximity on Spatial Distribution and Efficiency of Vascular Convection-Enhanced Delivery.\nConvection-enhanced delivery (CED) is an infusion method whereby solutions are slowly infused into the brain through small catheters to enhance the efficacy of drug delivery while minimizing drug exposure to the systemic circulation. Recent studies have shown that placement of multiple infusion catheters adjacent to one another has a limited adverse effect on drug efficacy while more than doubling infusion rates. To date, the optimal spacing between infusion catheters has not been assessed. Further, because of the large surface area of the brain and the need for a large surface area catheter (e.g. 3 mm diameter) for infusion in humans, it is unclear if the increase in infusion rates seen with the placement of multiple catheters will be sufficient for clinical infusion, especially for delivery of large molecules. We therefore evaluated the effect of catheter diameter, number, and spacing of catheters on the distribution and efficiency of drug infusion by quantifying drug concentration profiles in rat brain after CED delivery of either fluorescent dye or 125I-labeled human serum albumin (HSA). We find that increasing catheter number at constant catheter spacing improves the efficiency of distribution along the length of the catheter but only results in a modest increase in overall distribution due to the loss of distribution efficacy at the distal end of the catheter. Furthermore, although the increased infusion rates permitted by the placement of multiple catheters results in more rapid drug delivery out of the catheter into the brain and a more complete distribution of drug throughout the catheter surface, the increase in drug infusion rates is insufficient for delivery of 125I-labeled HSA, a large conjugate of HSA labeled with an iodine-125 isotype.<EOD> .\nThe results of intracorneal implantation of calcium phosphate (Ca-P) ceramics as experimental models for keratoprostheses in rabbits were presented.

In this review, we focus mainly on recent advances in epigenetics in plants caused by abiotic stresses, and further discuss how epigenetics may affect plant biotic stress responses. By means of chromatin modifications and interplays, epigenetic mechanisms dynamically regulate gene expression, thus participating in plant development and stress responses. Epigenetic inheritance could be an important factor for plants to adapt in a changing environment. Although the complexity in plant epigenomes still poses huge challenges for investigators to decipher the whole picture, our improved understanding of plant chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms should help to tackle current practical questions in agriculture, including drought tolerance.<EOD> A case of non-metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nA 53-year old male with a history of tobacco chewing presented to the surgical oncology unit with weight loss, pain in the neck and a difficulty in swallowing. Oesophagoscopy showed a large fungating bulky tumour measuring 10x5 cm, which was a moderately differentiated mucosal squamous cell cancer extending for 6 cm. A crossover biopsy gave a diagnosis of squamous cell cancer with positive surgical margins. The patient was treated with three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The patient was disease-free with no evidence of metastases at 6 months of postsurgery, and had only a mild side effect of nausea which did not require any treatment. This case highlights how neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used to shrink the tumour, and is therefore an effective method of inducing a response to cancer.<EOD> .\nUNLABELLED\nLung nodules, especially those less than 1 cm in diameter, are difficult to identify, particularly on chest radiography.

Gastric mucosal damage was produced with indomethacin in rats using a standardized in vivo test measuring gastric damage, including quantitative histological assessment. The compounds were administered orally with doses of 1-20 mg/kg, and the histological analysis of tissue samples was performed blind, in random order, evaluating gastric parietal, lamina propria, submucosal and muscular tissues. Both compounds tested showed ability to inhibit gastric damage. Omeprazole produced a higher inhibition both on tissue levels (p = 0.0049, ANOVA) and on gastric damage (p = 0.001, t-test) than ranitidine. Histological findings corroborated these results. These findings suggest that omeprazole may have a different ability to protect the gastric mucosa than ranitidine.<EOD> Cytologic-histologic correlation of pulmonary fine-needle biopsies.\nTwenty-four human specimens were obtained from patients who had lung nodules diagnosed cytologically.

Vascular rings from small mesenteric arteries were obtained from 14 patients with congestive heart failure and 12 normal subjects. Contractions were measured after endothelium removal (precontraction with norepinephrine ) and after treatment with ET-1 (10(-10) and 10(-9) M), in the presence of different blockers (sarafotoxin 6c, FR 139317, BQ-123, BQ-788, and BQ-610). ET-1-induced contraction increased when contraction had previously been triggered by NE, and sarafotoxin 6c (an ETB-receptor antagonist), FR-139317 (a ETA-receptor antagonist), and BQ-788 (an ETB-receptor antagonist) inhibited this effect. Additionally, the ET-1-induced contraction in the presence of NE-induced precontraction was lower in patients than controls, mainly due to the higher effect of FR-139317. It is concluded that ET-1 induced arterial contraction is mediated by both ETA and ETB subtypes, and that there is a greater contribution of the ETB subtype in patients than in controls.<EOD> Disseminated coccidioidomycosis in an Ectomys fuscus\nAn Ectomys fuscus had severe coccidioidal histoplasmosis infection.

For problem `1` and `2`, you need to construct a new recurrent neural network structure that uses the input signal to make decision when encountering new data. For problem `3`, we will use our designed attention model in `2.1.1` to solve it.\n\n## Problem `1`:\nWhen given a patient note, the task is to make a decision using the clinical trial.\n\nThe input to the network includes the patient note, the clinical trial and the labels. Thus, we construct a 3-layer Multi-Head Self-Attention layer to generate the attention vectors for each node in the patient note and the labels of a trial. It is a composition of a Multi-Head Self-Attention layer and a Concatenate layer, which will be used as an intermediate unit, which is shown in Figure 1. The first Multi-Head Self-Attention layer is an [7,3,3] convolution where the input is the combination of the patient note, the labels of a trial and the patient note. The same convolution operation is repeated for the second Multi-Head Self-Attention layer and concatenated with the Concatenate layer to generate the hidden representation of individual nodes.\nFor the patient note, we apply the BiLSTM on it to generate the hidden representation of words, which is fed into the Multi-Head Self-Attention layer, and then concatenated with the hidden representation of nodes generated by the first convolution before being fed into the BiLSTM again. The same BiLSTM procedure is followed for the labels of a trial. The output feature vectors of the word and node are concatenated and used as the input to the second MultiHead Self-Attention and then concatenated with the output feature vector of the labels of a trial to form the hidden representation of the full sequence. \n\nThe patient note, the clinical trial and the labels are generated with padding, so the attention vectors of each individual word or node are padded with 0 values to the left and right.\n\nFinally, the hidden representations of nodes and the output feature vectors of words and nodes are flattened and fed to a Linear layer followed by a Binary Crossentropy loss function. \n\n![2022](https://github.com/zq-zhang/YN",

In vivo, however, the functional association between HSPA14 and the proteasome remains to be determined. Here we report the identification of the Cut Homeobox protein (CUX) as a regulator of Hsp70 chaperone activity, enabling HSPA14 association with the proteasome core particle (CP). We demonstrate that this association facilitates P54(S3) endopeptidase in vitro and is essential for normal growth, development, and proteostasis maintenance. Furthermore, we show that HSPA14 accumulates in aging fly brains and is up-regulated in two distinct model systems of neurodegenerative disease. Our findings uncover an integral role for Hsp70 proteins in endopeptidase action.\n[Supplemental material is available for this article.]\nThe ubiquinous heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is highly conserved and plays critical roles in diverse processes such as protein folding, transport and turnover, and signaling pathways [bib_ref]  Molecular chaperones: integrators of cellular systems in health and disease, Soti [/bib_ref] .

In 1945, Hines and associates' reported that arteriosclerosis in the human autopsy material was more common in men with cholesterol levels above the fifth percentile of the normal male population than among those men with lower cholesterol values. Also in contrast to the Hines report, Friedman, Hess, and Gross' in 1952 found no marked correlation between the degree of atherosclerosis and serum cholesterol level in 100 men with coronary heart disease. The significance of serum lipid levels in the development of coronary atherosclerosis has recently been emphasized by Gofman\" and McNair.s In recent studies, the relationships between the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the atherosclerotic plaque size have been investigated. The present paper reports the results of some of these observations in 59 cases of coronary atherosclerosis. Serum Lipid Level Determinations-The total cholesterol levels were determined by the method of Friedewald,\" utilizing the Technicon Autoanalyzer. The triglyceride analyses were performed on the same Autoanalyzer. Both the cholesterol and triglycerides were determined from a single serum specimen from each patient. Estimation of Plaque Size in Autopsied Hearts-With the help of technicians, all of the aorta and coronary arteries of the hearts were cut across at several levels with the aid of the technicians, and each cross-section was measured. The measurements of each section were read off from a graphic record, to an accuracy of .04 cm. The plaque area in each section was determined as the difference between the sum of all the areas of the cuts and the area of the intimal surface of the cut segment.

There are two common inclusion criteria of a clinical study: age and gender. In clinical studies, one of the inclusion criteria is, for example, men aged <65 years, and the other is men aged >65 years.

Other common criteria are sex, age, and tumor type and stage. These criteria are used in the process of selecting a patient. The purpose of this assessment is to select the type and stage of the tumor that will be studied. The disease can be categorized based on whether it is simple or malignant, and the severity can be determined by the tumor stage.\n\n## Question 11 (Q102)\n\n\n\nWhat does a clinical study include? \nA) People who have a specific type of disease.

        "output": "<EOD> The relationship between prolactin and luteinizing hormone secretion: evidence for feedback from the corpus luteum.\nThe relationship between prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion was studied in patients treated for amenorrhea. The effect of estradiol on the feedback relationship between prolactin and LH was measured in ovariectomized prepubertal females. The effect of withdrawal of estradiol support on the relationship between prolactin and LH was investigated in a group of women with breast cancer who received estrogen replacement therapy. Our results indicate that a disproportionate increase in circulating prolactin is associated with low plasma LH levels. High plasma levels of LH were not associated with marked decreases in plasma prolactin levels. Administration of estradiol to suppress the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis reduced the negative feedback effect of prolactin on LH secretion. However, estrogen withdrawn from a patient with breast cancer and who was receiving estrogen replacement therapy resulted in increased prolactin levels and decreased LH concentrations. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of negative feedback from the prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors may be a disproportionate increase in circulating prolactin levels (the so-called hyperprolactinemic state). When prolactin concentrations rise above a certain threshold, the negative feedback is augmented. It is suggested that the hyperprolactinemic status seen in amenorrhea is due to endogenous disorders of LH secretion.<EOD> Proton beam therapy for pediatric malignancy: current experience in our institution.\nOBJECTIVES\nAccording to a National Survey in 1992 sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the number of children and adolescents suffering from severe malignancies was estimated to be 13,000.

This clinical study is a research project on the effects of medications on people with depression. In this clinical study, data are collected from several visits. Before each visit, the person is reminded to fill out a few questionnaires. One of these questionnaires includes questions related to the last week's usage of medication. When filling out the questionnaire, the patient is asked to enter the name of each medication they have taken each day. The names of the medications are stored in a database under the name of the medication they contain (e.g. Valium is stored under the name \"Valium\".)

In recent years, it is increasingly being used among pregnant women in early pregnancy, but the use of APAP during pregnancy has not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated the effect of APAP on activation of TLR2 and downstream inflammatory signaling. Our results showed that APAP increased transcriptional factor (NF-\u03baB) activity and production of various inflammatory proteins in a TLR2-dependent manner without affecting TLR2 expression. Treatment with APAP in the presence of inhibitors of upstream signaling components and small interfering RNA against PKC\u03b4 revealed that APAP induced activation of NF-\u03baB through PKC\u03b4 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Results of this study suggest that APAP has the potential to trigger TLR2 signaling and consequential inflammation in macrophages.<EOD> .\nThere are the three kinds of the \"three-in-one\" antibiotics: \"three times one\" that is sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), trimethoprim (TMP) and a fourth one, such as a fluoroquinolone or a sulfonamide drug together with one of the two; \"equal ratio of three\" that is SMZ, TMP, a fourth one, such as an aminoside or another sulfonamide as an equally mixed single solution with the antibiotics; \"equal-amount of three\" that is SMZ and TMP at the same concentration, and one fourth substance, like an aminopyrine, which is equal in amount.

The samples (n = 60) were either restored, using a compomer containing the remineralizing agents MI varnish (P60, GC America, USA) and MI Paste (P60, GC America, USA) or with a pure compomer. The samples were stored in either fresh artificial saliva at 37 degrees C or immersion in 1.5% citric acid solution for 24 h. The shear bond strengths were evaluated. The morphologies of the samples were studied after bond strength measurements under a scanning microscope. The shear bond strengths of the samples stored in fresh artificial saliva and the citric acid solution were statistically different, regardless of the kind of the compomer and the storage period. The best result was given by the samples stored in fresh artificial saliva. The incorporation of MI varnish or MI Paste and storage in fresh artificial saliva did not result in interfacial micro leakage.<EOD> Increase in 8-methoxypsoralen in skin and serum of patients undergoing photochemotherapy: a new method for measuring 8-methoxypsoralen in biological material by high performance liquid chromatography.\nSerum levels of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) were measured by a new method for quantitating 8-MOP by capillary high performance liquid chromatography.

There are multiple health benefits to be obtained and harms that may come with transplantation after dialysis, making the correct dialysis/ transplant decision challenging. In this review, I highlight the impact of dialysis on the kidney post-transplant and the transplant patient. I then discuss the role of dialysis in the setting of an impaired transplant. I finish the discussion with two tables of summary tables of outcomes for kidney transplantation in those patients who have had prior use of dialysis and for transplants in the setting of primary dialysis access.\nI am honoured to be asked to write on an area (nephrology/kidney-transplantation) I know so little about, but believe I am qualified to write about: the impact of dialysis care on kidney transplants and the impact of transplant care on dialysis.\n\n## Impact of dialysis on kidney transplantation\nThe transition from dialysis to a functioning kidney transplant has significant benefits in terms of quality of life including reduced psychological stress and improved social well-being.

OSA in heart failure is frequently unrecognized, and it is estimated that \u223c50% of patients with sleep apnea are undiagnosed. There is evidence that OSA adversely affects a range of cardiovascular conditions and is predictive of the development or progression of congestive heart failure. Therefore, recognizing and managing this treatable disorder is important in heart failure treatment. This review describes the diagnosis, the pathophysiology and associated adverse effects of sleep apnea, and the treatment of sleep apnea in the context of heart failure. The optimal care of patients with heart failure requires recognition that sleep apnea is common. An understanding of these issues is critical in the clinical care of this population. To improve care of patients, education of clinicians needs to be coupled with screening programs. For patients found to have sleep apnea, the standard treatment for heart failure should be implemented.

By characterizing and quantifying the HPV viral load by DNA hybridization assays and immunoassays to detect HPV oncoproteins in combination or alone, it is possible now to define the dynamic nature of the papilloma virus life cycle in the infected host, which can be used as a biomarker to help the researcher predict disease outcome in the infected host. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize studies that combined the measurement of HPV DNA and HPV cell\u2010free/cell\u2010captured mRNA or antibodies to viral oncoproteins or host proteins that bind to oncoproteins. Studies that measured at least two molecular assay types will be reviewed.<EOD> LC-MS/MS for the determination of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobut",

The rate of consumption per gender didn't show significant difference. The rate of alcohol abuse was higher in males than in females, in both years. The rate of alcohol consumption was significantly higher in youth, particularly in young adults aged 20 to 34 years, while the rate of alcohol abuse was higher in the elderly. In adults, the consumption rate remains higher than the rate of abuse. Mental disorders appeared as the main motivation; the second position was occupied by the social motivation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of NHIS data is the most important way, so far, to evaluate alcohol abuse in the general population. The results show that the rate of alcohol consumption was higher than that of alcohol abuse. The data show the necessity to improve the treatment of alcohol dependence and to decrease alcohol abuse.<EOD> The role of thrombin inhibition in treatment of arterial thrombosis and other thromboembolic",

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are produced in the process of nonenzymatic glycosylation, interact with AGEs-specific receptors (RAGEs), leading to end-stage organ damage. The present study is aimed at addressing whether HSYA can protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) against AGEs-induced disorders. HUVECs were pretreated with HSYA (0, 5, 10, 20 \u00b5M), followed by 200 \u00b5g/mL AGEs incubation. Cell viability, migration, and proliferation were examined using MTT assay, wound healing assay, and EdU incorporation assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Western blot was performed to determine the protein levels of p-p38, p-ERK, p-JNK, RAGE, Bax, Bcl-2, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The results showed that HUVECs treated with AGEs had a reduced viability, migration and proliferation, and an increased apoptosis and ICAM-1 level. HSYA reduced cell apoptosis and ICAM-1 level in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of HSYA on improving viability, migration, and proliferation were reversed by the administration of the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Our data indicate that HSYA protects HUVECs from AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, which may be mediated by p38 signaling activation and downregulation of ICAM-1.<EOD> A genetic epidemiological study of multiple sclerosis in Scotland",

Carbapenemase activity is due to the synthesis of a thiol beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing multiple beta-lactam antibiotics and its production is often associated with the presence of a plasmid. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the best known Gram-negative carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates (1,2). Up to now, three genetically different carbapenemases have been detected: i.e., GES-type, IMI-type, and KPC-type (3,4). K. pneumoniae expressing the IMI-type enzyme has been described in 1990 in Italy, but the other two enzymes were never detected in Italy or elsewhere in the world. The recent article published by Coppola et al. (5) describes two clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae that produce KPC-2 carbapenemase in Italy. This work is the best evidence so far of the worldwide dissemination of this new and dangerous class of beta-lactamase. Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is an alarming phenomenon of increasing significance in health care facilities and the community. Up to now, carbapenem resistance was associated with the production of metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-2, which has recently been observed in some clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae (6). Our preliminary study suggests that K. pneumoniae expressing KPC enzyme is more clinically significant than that expressing VIM-2, as VIM-producing K. pneumoniae has been frequently isolated since 1991 in our hospital.<EOD> Effect of endogenous renin-angiotensin system on pro-inflammatory cytokines and renal vasoconstrictor response in rats with renal ischemia reper",

Methods: In this case-control study, 100 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR test were compared with the control group of 200 adult volunteers in terms of anthropometric features. Body mass index, blood pressure, biochemical tests, and abdominal ultrasound were performed for all participants. Results: In our NAFLD patients, serum AST (58\u00b135.2 compared to 37\u00b153 IU/L) and ALT (70\u00b156 compared to 43\u00b185 IU/L) were significantly higher than that of controls, indicating a hepatic injury. The prevalence of NAFLD was higher among patients with COVID-19 than among the control participants (p<0.001). In addition, the NAFLD patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of having severe COVID-19 when compared to the control group members (p<0.001). Conclusion: We found that patients with NAFLD are susceptible to severe COVID-19, and may provide a guide for further evaluation of patients for the disease.\n\n# Introduction\nAt the end of 2019, a novel virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or the 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV-2) emerged in China as a causative agent of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan that rapidly spread all over the world.

However, little is known regarding the effect of this novel therapeutic agent in vWD patients with inhibitor(s) to FVIII. We report two patients with a history of intractable hemorrhage, in whom recombinant activated human factor VII was effective in controlling acute intractable hemorrhage and allowed urgent major surgery. However, the dosages needed to control bleeding were larger than expected in patients with vWD and inhibitor(s) to FVIII because the patients' FVIII inhibitor titer diminished gradually. The half-lives of activated FVII in both patients were approximately 23 hours, although the half-life of recombinant factor VII in healthy volunteers is about 60 hours and this may also affect optimal dosage. In a laboratory examination, it was clear that the activity of recombinant activated human factor VII did not change during its storage time.<EOD> Anesthetic Efficacy of 4% Articaine Administered Via Conventional Needle Penetration vs. Painless Maxillofacial Injections-A Randomized Single blind Clinical Trial\n\nPMCID: PMC8505784 J Med Sci: 2022; 26 (8): 300-307\n\n# Introduction\nA successful anesthesia is a pre-requisite for a successful minor surgical procedure.

Stents are especially commonly used in patients with kidney calculi, which prevent the flow of urine. Stents have a variety of potential side effects including urinary tract infections (UTIs). Most urinary tract infections are mild and not life threatening, however, they may cause septicemia and renal failure, which can be fatal. There are two commonly prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections: cefazolin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The risk of infection from a urinary stent placed in the urinary tract is higher in some patients.

The effects of nitric oxide (NO) on energy metabolism in astroglial cells (astrocytes) are discussed. Astroglia play a major role in the regulation of brain cell energy metabolism by generating lactate using glycolysis in astrocytes, which is then transferred to neighboring neurons using astroglial-neuronal lactate transport (ALT). Astrocytes regulate the synthesis of ALT through the regulation of ATP, pyruvate, and lactate. This study proposes that NO is involved in the regulation of ATP and lactate, which could affect energy metabolism and cell cycle progression.<EOD> .\nNinety-three patients with severe burns were treated by a method based on that of burns treatment in the Netherlands between August 1987 and February 1988.

The key concept behind STRAW is to be able to compare any patient note to the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial on the fly, given the patient's electronic health record. The system can also suggest other trials with similar eligibility of a given patient.\nWe have also shown that medical natural language processing is a powerful tool to help health practitioners in their daily work. We have proved the existence of important medical concepts as \"eligibility\", \"exclusion criterion\" etc. that are used in clinical trial recruitment, and that their analysis is feasible within the scope of automatic natural language processing.\n\n# Limitation\n\n# Limitation:\nThere are some limitations to our system. Firstly there may be some missing inclusion or exclusion criteria that are not yet documented. For example, if one clinical trial has a more demanding eligibility criterion such as \"patients with type 1 diabetes\", we can't include them into our system. Secondly, we extract the inclusion and exclusion criteria from clinical trial registries that require the inclusion and exclusion of variables explicitly.\n\n# Result\n\n# Result:\nOur automatic and efficient solution for clinical trial recruitment improves the performance of the practitioners by providing a fast, reliable, consistent and objective method to compare patients to clinical trials. As future work we plan to test the STRAW tool in real world settings, and we are looking forward to receive feedback from the actual health practitioners.\nWe also plan to extend the STRAW tool with an ontology of diseases, and we will build an interface to this ontology to give suggestions of the most similar diseases when a patient has an eligibility with respect to an inclusion criterion.

In this example you are to output the same trial-level eligibility for the above patient note and clinical trial. For this example I'll use a `Duplicates.js` file, a [JavaScript module]() available from GitHub. \n\nLet's think about the requirements. One requirement is that you are to output only `1;`. That means you have to disallow the entry of `2;`. I'll explain more about this requirement below. Another is that you are to output the same assessment of eligibility. Here we should not rely on the user input, we'll set the output upfront. Let's make use of [constants]() objects. Constants in JavaScript are variables which should be imported once and never modified. They are always initialized before any variable in the module. In this way they do not cause any side effect and are easier to maintain. \n\nFirst, let's declare all of the constants needed for this exercise.\n```javascript\nlet Trial = 'The Relationship Between Vitamin D, Fingernail Thickness and Bone Density';\nlet Scale = '2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.';\nlet Patient = 'An 85-year-old man';\nlet PatientNote = `An 85-year-old man is brought to the ER because of gradual decrease in his level of consciousness.

Skinfold thicknesses at biceps, triceps, subscapular, iliac crest, axilla, suprailiac, midaxillary, front thigh, medial calf, and medial upper arm were measured with a Harpenden skinfold caliper. Total fat mass (FMt) and percentage of total body fat (%BF) were estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with an Inbody 2.0. Total body water (TBW) was computed by using FFM and the values of TBW according to Siri.

However, the functional role of PEDF in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in response to pressure overload remain to be determined. We generated transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing human (h) PEDF in heart under control of cardiac-restricted \u03b1-myosin heavy chain promoter. Here, we studied in vivo and in vitro models of cardiac hypertrophy by transverse aortic banding to characterize the role of PEDF in cardiac hypertrophy. Compared with non-TG (N) littermates, echography and morphometry analyses of TG mice showed significantly lower weight and left ventricle wall thickness, increased fractional shortening, and decreased lung weight to body weight ratio. In addition, cardiac PEDF mRNA expression was found to be significantly higher while the expressions of atrial natriuretic protein and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly lower in TG mice. Protein analysis showed markedly attenuated p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 in TG mice, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation. Examination of human cardiac tissues from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed the levels of both PEDF mRNA and protein were significantly lower than those from patients at baseline. Furthermore, our results showed a significant correlation between the decreased expression of PEDF and increased angiotensin II (Ang II) in peripheral blood. These observations demonstrated PEDF is a physiological inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy.<EOD> Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Risk Factors in Patients Presenting for Coronary Artery Surgery in Central India.\nDementia is a growing public health issue and",

Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers. Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls, gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome measures within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an intervention to reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.~Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a higher risk of",

Currently, more than twenty genes related to ciliary ultrastructure and function are being studied as possible biomarkers for PCD, and CCDC39 is a novel gene reported recently. To date, 11 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within this gene have been reported. In the present study, we investigated a novel c.1245C > G mutation in CCDC39 in a family with PCD and the impact on ciliary ultrastructure.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFive members of a family underwent genetic screening for CCDC39 mutations with a combination of targeted sequencing and Sanger sequencing.

We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) with the aim of determining whether interventions to reduce PUI could be recommended.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched multiple databases to identify SRs examining interventions in preventing PUI in adults of any age, of which older people were a sub-group. We extracted data from included SRs on methodology, study setting and intervention; study design, outcome measures and findings; and any economic evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 16 SRs and their 247 primary studies. Thirteen were conducted in one or more hospital setting; three in community-specific settings. All SRs focused on PUI prevention rather than management. The majority used unrestricted inclusion criteria; 13 used risk of bias tools and only three conducted formal meta-analysis. Only one SR contained clear economic analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe limited information on the quality of the primary studies and small number of SRs in this area suggests the need for further work on PUIs in older people to improve this underresearched area.<EOD> .\nIt is estimated that one third of world vegetal resources can be found in the Andean area, of which 18,582 plant species are found in Mexico.

Interventions to address these deficits remain a challenge. Evidence Acquisition:A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the early application of an in-hospital neurorehabilitation program for improving mobility and neurocognitive outcomes in survivors of moderate-to-severe stroke; 49 consecutive patients 18 years of age or older with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) severity scores greater than 16 were randomized and allocated to early hospital-based (2 wk) versus conventional therapy. For intervention patients, treatment was tailored to individual patient needs and was performed for 2 weeks by a team of specialized physiotherapists. Outcome measures included the Barthel Index, Functional Ambulation Categories, Modified Ashworth Scale, Manual Function Test, Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, Visual Object and Space Perception Test, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. All patients were assessed on admission and at 1 and 18 months after stroke.

The investigators aim to assess whether continued aspirin treatment increases the risk of CSDH in mild head trauma patients 50 years and older who present with negative head CT. The investigators further aim to use the initial findings to refine the study design, with the goal of performing a larger, multi-institutional study in the future.~Over a 12-month period, approximately 100 patients \u226550 years of age on LDA prophylaxis presenting to Hadassah's Emergency Department after sustaining mild head injury, will be examined by the neurosurgeon on call.

In this investigation, we explored the antitumor activity of polydatin and the conjugate of 5,10-dihydroxycamptothecin (DHCPT) and polydatin (PD-CPT) in vitro and in vivo. The molecular structures of PD-CPT and DHCPT were fully characterized by (1)H-NMR and ESI-MS spectra; the PD-CPT was prepared by a facile coupling reaction of DHCPT and PD; the results showed that PD-CPT had a stronger inhibitory effect upon human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (H460) or human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT116 p53(-/-)) than DHCPT and could sensitize the apoptosis resistance of p53-null HCT116 cells to DHCPT. The binding mode of PD to human topoisomerase (hTop1) was investigated by the kinetic constant assay, fluorescence titration, surface plasma resonance (SPR), circular dichroism, and molecular modeling technique. These assays indicated that PD could be used as a substrate of hTop1 to inhibit the activity of hTop1; furthermore, PD could bind Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and trap the enzyme-DNA binary complex.

Increased binding of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to SERT has been implicated as a mechanism underlying response to antidepressants in some patients, and preclinical studies indicate TA-0910 has superior serotonergic neuroplasticity effects compared with SSRIs. Because response to antidepressants is variable and heterogeneous it is possible that antidepressant activity is not dependent on enhanced SERT inhibition. Here we assessed the effects of TA-0910 in a model of Tourette's syndrome (TS), as a model of heterogeneous and non-response to antidepressants with a heterogeneous phenotype including abnormal behaviors similar to tics. Chronic infusion of TA-0910 into the nucleus accumbens of male CD1 and B6 mice did not alter apomorphine-induced stereotyped behaviors, such as head twitch responses (HTRs), although the latter mouse strain responded. A TA-0910 dose-dependent increase in the number of HTRs was observed at some doses in CD1 and B6 mice and suggests the effects of TA-0910 in this behavior are not identical between strains. TA-0910 treatment of mice transgenic for the human SERT gene in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, resulted in elevated amphetamine-induced locomotion, an effect we have shown previously in these mice is attributable to elevated 5-",

The leftmost line must be the patient ID. We will set it to `1` by default. When we have multiple patients in one note, we will still need only 6 lines which show patient ID, Trial-level eligibility, Inclusion criteria, and Trial status and outcome. You can modify the output in the code to any other formats. I will demonstrate the other output formats later.\n\nOne other thing we need is a dictionary to store the information for each clinical trial, such as patient ID, eligibility criteria, clinical trial status, inclusion criteria, etc. You can simply define it in the code below. As you can see, the dictionary information has several sub-types with different properties. We will discuss its each sub-types later.\n\n```python\n# 24/27\ndef eligibility_for_trial(path):\n    global recruitment_info\n\n    recruitment_info['clinical_trial_path'] = path\n\n    # We will get a file object and a list of lines\n    with open(path, 'r') as f:\n        linest = ''.join(f.readlines()).splitlines()\n\n    linest = linest[3:7] # Note the colon \":\"\n    linest = linest.replace(\"  'TrialLevelEligibility : \", '').replace(\"- \", \"_\").split(\"\\n\") # Remove spaces and quotes.\n\n    recruitment_info['TrialLevelEligibiilty'] = linest[0] \n    recruitment_info['InclusionCriteria'] = linest[1]\n    # This line represents `TrialIncluded : 1`. The \"1\" will be ignored. So we will compare the string with `InclusionCriteria",

We show that the contribution of the defects to protonic charge dynamics is more significant than that of the bulk protons, and that there exists no stable equilibrium defect structure if it acts as a proton carrier. We show that protons are localized when oxide ion vacancies serve as proton carriers, and oxide anion vacancies are also unstable if they are responsible for proton conduction.\nHydrogen is ubiquitous in nature, being present in water and in almost all biomolecules 1 . The presence of hydrogen in chemistry is therefore important, and the properties of fluids made of hydrogen are important also in industrial context, especially in proton conducting devices.

For this purpose, the immersed three-dimensional calculation of the wetting pressure by the rough interface is made by the immersed boundary method. The interface is assumed to be a random surface consisting of a cylindrical part at the upstream edge of the interface, and the part is described as the Gaussian stochastic process. The width of the stochastic profile is varied from 5 to 75 \u03bcm with the periodicity, i.e., wavelength, \u03c3 of the surface, which is in the range from 0 (a step height) to 100 \u03bcm in three steps: \u03c3 = 3.0, 6.97, and 13.93 \u03bcm. The interfacial area ratio, \u03be of the stochastic profile, where the surface area ratio, \u03b6, was assumed to vary with \u03b6 = 1, 2, and 4. The interfacial areas of the stochastic profile are the same as that of the interface of the cylindrical part. In the three-dimensional calculation, the pressure gradient on the cylindrical part was kept to be 0.\n\n# I. introduction\nWetting properties, i.e., contact angle and wetting pressure, for solid-liquid interfaces, are of fundamental importance in all natural occurrences and industrial applications. The contact angle \u03b8 is one of the most important parameters in characterizing the wetting properties. It is not an easy task to directly determine the contact angle by the experimental method since the contact line cannot be pinned under general wetting conditions. Moreover, the contact angle varies with a contact angle hysteresis,",

However, the previous method of genome-wide allele-specific methylation detection was difficult to be applied in the analysis of methylation in a limited number of cells or nuclei. Therefore, we used bisulfite DNA for treatment according to the methods of whole-genome amplification and DNA methylation-specific PCR. The specific primers amplified the target genome sequence that had methylated CpG sites to form the fragments with the length 298 base pairs. These PCR products were gel purified and then sequenced. After the fragments were digested by the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we found that in mammals, different types of methylation might play different roles in the embryo development.\n\n# Introduction\nGenomic imprinting is a distinct type of epigenetic modification that occurs in one allele only in early development. Thus, the methylation of parental allele is usually not distributed equally between male and female. Epigenetic modification is a significant modification in the pattern of gene expression without permanent change in DNA sequence, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA regulation [bib_ref]  Epigenetics in mammals, Esteller [/bib_ref] . DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark and is a fundamental process in all DNA-encoded cellular processes. DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) catalyze the addition of a methyl group from s-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the fifth position of cytosine, typically in the sequence 5'-CpG-3', to form 5-methyl-C-pG [bib_ref]  DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory, Bird [/bib_ref] .

Its role in organ development, cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis is increasingly recognized. In this study, our aim is to investigate the role of urothelial derived AM in proliferation, differentiation and cytotoxicity.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nUrothelial cell lines RT4 and T24 were used to generate stable cell lines carrying AM-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Changes in the markers involved in proliferation and differentiation in both cell types were evaluated by western blot, immunophenotypic analysis and real-time (RT) PCR, respectively. The functional role of AM in cytotoxicity was determined by evaluating cytotoxicity in RT4 and T24 cells by RT-PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe AM protein and its receptors were expressed in both RT4 and T24 cells with no significant difference. Down-regulation of AM caused a decrease in proliferation as indicated with a decrease in cyclins and cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs) and an increase in the markers of differentiation such as cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and Uroplakin. No significant differences were found in cytotoxicity assay when compared with the controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAM was shown to cause a change in proliferation and differentiation in the urothelial cells. Since the RT4 cell line is closer to the normal urothelium which is mostly squamous, while T24 has a more de-differentiated phenotype, these results indicate that AM may have a role of urothelial differentiation and possibly bladder cancer progression.<EOD> Genetic variability and path",

We have considered that single-stage exchange surgery cost is calculated only adding the cost of the revision surgery, whereas a two-stage exchange surgery cost takes into account the cost of two surgeries (revision surgery and implant removal) and the costs of infection treatment (antibiotic therapy, wound management, and patient home care).ResultsWe evaluated 668 primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures and 127 patients who had THA infections (18.62%). Among the 668 primary cases, we detected two PJI (0.3%). Of the 127 patients with PJI, 23 (18.1%) underwent revision surgery as a single-stage exchange procedure, and 104 patients (81.9%) underwent a two-stage exchange surgery. One-stage revision surgery in the patients with PJI of a THA involved a significant reduction of the costs compared to the two-stage procedure.\n\n# Introduction\nIn recent decades, total hip arthroplasty (THA) represents a frequently performed procedure with an overall life expectancy in the United States of about 700,000 in 2016 and about 500,000 in 2017. However, the rate of revision surgery is estimated to be around 3% according to the National Joint Registry of England and Wales, and 4.7% according to the Australian National Arthroplasty Data Center.\nAlthough it accounts for about 1-3% of THA procedures, periprosthetic",

The patient previously received 14 cycles of crizotinib because of the patient's personal wishes and crizotinib was discontinued because of brain metastasis, multiple lung nodules, and bone metastasis. ALK mutation was detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the second generation of a cerebral metastasis from a paraffin sample. The patient died due to intracranial hemorrhage about three weeks later. A rare mutation of T790M was found in the EML4-ALK region of the tumor specimens. NGS and other detection methods showed that no other activated oncogenes were detected. ALK fusion may be detected for a long time after acquired resistance to crizotinib, though very few mutation sites should be checked for the efficacy of targeted therapy. Genetic analysis of the tumor specimen after acquired resistance to targeted treatment is helpful to provide the basis for new targeted drug design.<EOD> Changes in gait characteristics in old age - effects of aging, cognitive status and walking speed.\nAIM\nTo investigate age-related changes in gait parameters and to examine their relationship with cognitive status in the elderly.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 63 elderly persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, and 57 cognitively healthy elderly (CH) as a control group for the study.

We have adapted an in vitro assay system using first trimester human trophoblasts and rabbit trophoblasts cultured in the presence or absence of oxygen at various times after isolation. By using a single cell suspension technique, trophoblasts have been quantified, and their ability to differentiate into invasive forms determined. The results demonstrate that under differentiation conditions a high proportion of these cells could differentiate into cells that express invasive behaviour and can degrade extracellular matrix and invade matrigel invasion chambers. Only 9% of rabbit trophoblasts have an invasive phenotype, in contrast to 39% of the invading and noninvasive human trophoblasts. After culture in 1% O2, there were many more cells with an invasive phenotype (28% rabbit cells and 91% human cells); also present were many noninvasive cells. The numbers of these two cell types in both cell types changed during the course of culture in 1% O2. There was a gradual increase in the proportion of invasive cells for human cells in the 1st and 2nd weeks following establishment of culture, while there was no such cellular change in rabbit cells during this period. Our results suggest a model for differentiation of noninvasive trophoblast leading to cellular invasion after transfer to 1% O2 within an early implantation site. Our data may have implications for the early events surrounding implantation in the human.<EOD> The effects of different forms of nutritional counseling on patients' knowledge, behavior and physicians' perception in Iran.\nBACKGROUND\nThere are different methods of nutritional counseling, ranging from the use of printed materials to the counselor's individualized approach, however the optimal method is not well established.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe aim of our study was to compare the effects of several counseling methods on knowledge, behavior, and physicians' perception among 139",

The severe shortage of tests and treatments, in addition to the high mortality of COVID-19, make it imperative to have efficient diagnosis techniques to control the spread of this disease. In this context, the identification of molecular biomarkers is of vital importance since it enables the characterization of the pathophysiology of the disease and its timely diagnosis, helping to avoid the excessively aggressive treatments. In addition, these biomarkers may provide information relating to the evolution and control of the disease, as well as, the prediction of the response to therapies. However, as we currently face an unprecedented novel viral outbreak, no reliable biomarkers have been yet determined and the diagnosis is based only on the epidemiological data, a clinical evidence and the presence of COVID-19 infection upon a molecular assay.

These patients were compared with forty-seven patients who were eligible for surgery because they had severe unremitting pain and limited joint mobility but who did not undergo the operation. Two scores were used to record the severity of the disease at the start of the follow-up period. The Multi-trait Orthopedic Index for the Hip and the Modified Radiographic Assessment of the Hip both showed statistically significant improvement (P less than 0,001) in the operated group by the last postoperative assessment. At this time, both of these scores also showed a continued improvement (P less than 0,05) over the preoperative scores of the patients who were not considered suitable for operation.

In total, 1227 studies were screened, and 197 full papers were retrieved. After duplicates were removed, 124 publications (published until March 2017) which reported on the association between coffee consumption and breast cancer incidence were identified. Fourteen prospective cohort studies (25 publications) providing relative risks (RRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs) according to the levels of coffee consumption and 12 publications providing sufficient data on both quantities were identified (Figure 1). A flowchart of the study selection is provided in the Additional file 1, Table S1 (see Supporting Information). \n \nThe definition of coffee consumption in each study was based on the types of coffee consumed, the frequency of consumption (including cups per day or year), and the methods used for coffee preparation. Coffee consumption was classified into three categories in each study, based on tertiles.

One of the most complicated issues to be solved is the selection of the amino acid residues that should be fixed in the designed fragments to improve affinity with the target protein. In this paper, we present a method to design a rigid fragment by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. In our method, the target-protein fragment complex is investigated by NMR to identify the residues most responsible for the interaction with the target protein. Only the essential amide signals obtained at the target-protein fragment complex were used to generate the fragment from its crystal structures. The 1D NOESY spectrum of designed fragments indicated that designed fragments are more rigid than the original fragments. The designed fragments had improved affinity toward the target protein compared to the original fragments (dissociation constant, Kd: 300\u2009nM for the original) and have potential as tools for further research focusing on chemical synthesis of peptides.<EOD> Impurity diffusion pathways in crystalline silicon revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.\n\nThe diffusion pathways of native defects and intrinsic impurities in crystalline silicon are investigated by X-ray absorption nearedge spectroscopy.

It has been suggested that NAEs could activate the adenosine A3 receptor (A3R) and that the anandamide (ANAM) transporter inhibitor UCM7655 is a potent and selective agonist for the 18 kDa (18 kDaA3R) but also for the 23 kDa (23 kDaA3R) alternative splice variant of the A3R. However, there is no unambiguous consensus on the agonist nature of NAEs. We have addressed this question by performing molecular dynamics free energy calculations using the alchemical transformation (\u201cgating\u201d) approach. In this method, the energy of one molecule was progressively added to that of the alternative (in the case of the allosteric agonist), allowing for an estimation of the difference in free energy. The results obtained in this study showed that the N-acetylethanolamines, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), in addition to ANAM, are not selective A3R agonists on both 18 kDaA3R and 23 kDaA3R. Furthermore, THC was also found to be not an effective agonist for A3Rs unlike UCM",

If it makes sense to you, then you are likely in good shape.\nThe answer is a bit more complex than the questions would lead you to believe, but for now you can read the code like this:\n// First, you should compare the patient description to the clinical trial description.\n// The comparison should come with a judgment \"fit\" if the description is not in the clinical trial description. So you have one line like:\n// patient[i].equalsIgnoreCase(ClinicalTrial[j].description);\n// And a negative evaluation if it fit.\n// Then you should use a recursive logic to evaluate each element of the patient list, and the eligibility criteria list. You might want to compare all patient elements, to each criteria element of the eligibility criteria.\n// Note that you can't check the patient to criteria element one by one. That's why you have this recursive logic: you compare to the criteria from a current criteria item up to this patient (if the criteria item is not null and is not the end of your criteria), else you go to the next criteria. So the patient to criteria evaluation follows this logic:\n//if criteria is not null:\n//check for each patient from the current criteria to the next criteria.\n//check whether the patient is not a null element,\n//check whether the length of the patient is not 0,\n//if the criteria fits:\n//if the patient fits:\n//if criteria is null:\n//you are good:\n//else:\n//your recursion:\n//\n//If a criteria returns \"yes\", then the patient fits the criteria.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: One freestanding pediatric hospital. Patients/Participants: Infants 0 to 24 months old (N\u2009=\u2009544) from March 2006 to March 2012 who required general pediatric surgery for the index diagnosis. These infants were stratified into two groups: (1) at high risk for surgical complications and (2) not at high risk for surgical complications. Measurement and Main Results: Infant, maternal, and household SES characteristics were combined to generate an overall summary measure and then categorized as high, medium, or low. Race is a dichotomous variable. Bivariate analyses were used to determine the association between an infant's SES, race, and receipt of surgical care. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the predictors affecting receipt of surgical care. Of the 1,088 clinical evaluations, 544 were classified as high risk, and 544 were classified as nonhigh risk. SES data were provided for 507 of 544 infants, and race data were available for 508.

It is recommended that exercise training be implemented during breast cancer treatment and may be beneficial in preventing treatment-related side effects and improving survival.Purpose: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the effects of a combination of exercise on exercise capacity, cardiorespiratory or musculoskeletal fitness, lean body mass, body fat and quality of life in women with breast cancers that have received various treatments and during different stages of treatment delivery.Methods: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials, including 1489 participants that had been allocated into exercise and control groups were included. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane tool for bias assessment. Meta-analysis was conducted for body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life. To investigate the changes across treatment and stages, the data were divided into five subgroups based on time of data collection (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and post-surgery, neo-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy).Results: The majority of studies indicated an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.75; P = 0.003], and a decrease in body fat post-treatment (SMD: \u22121.74; 95% CI, \u22122.57 to \u22120.91; P < 0.001).Conclusion: Findings indicated that, among women with breast cancers, exercise-based interventions improved several health-related outcomes. These results support the practice of exercise for breast cancer patients based on the results of this review, and we suggest that the exercise protocol be selected based on the stage of breast cancer treatment.Systematic Review Registration: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ display_",

Platelet nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the regulation of platelet function. The aim of the present study was to examine the in vitro effects of sildenafil citrate, a novel PDE5-inhibitor currently used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, on the activity of purified human platelet cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE5) and on in vitro platelet aggregation. Methods and results\u2014The activity of human PDE5A was evaluated by measuring the enzymic destruction of the nonradioactive substrate 6-methylthiopurine (6 MTP) using an HPLC method. An IC50 of 48 nM for 6 MTP was observed for sildenafil as compared with 111 nM for cGMP. Pretreatment of washed platelets with sildenafil (100 nM to 1 \u03bcM) significantly inhibited the thrombin, ADP, collagen, platelet activating factor and arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation in a concentration dependent manner (ID50 4\u201340 nM). The aggregation response to Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was also completely inhibited by sildenafil at 100 nM (ID50 3 nM). In contrast, the platelet aggregation response to ADP in the presence of cGMP (50 \u03bcM) was not significantly altered with regard to the time to onset while the plateau aggregation response measured at 4 minutes was significantly decreased from 74 \u00b1 5% to 51 \u00b1 3% with cGMP.

This makes it very difficult to analyze whether the effects can be attributed to bio-inspired therapy or not. To better understand the mechanism behind this treatment and to make the treatment even more effective, Prof. Ming Lu and some colleagues plan to incorporate the feedback from the patient's brains. To that end, they plan to implant a 10-microelectrode array (MEA) in the brain of the patient and simultaneously measure electroencephalogram (EEG). This way, feedback, as well as treatment, could be achieved simultaneously.

It encodes 35 ORFs that are separated by large blocks of DNA carrying terminal GC-rich sequence blocks. The GC-rich blocks also contain several large intergenic sequences and a tRNA(Ile) gene. GC-rich regions are also found at the left and right ends of the DNA, which is 19 kb in length. Three of the ORFs (designated ORF1 to ORF3) encode a 6-keto-prolinase, a GMP synthetase and a phosphopantethiene synthetase (a conserved domain of phage-encoded lipid A biosynthetic enzymes). The intergenic sequences contain a palindrome of 17 bp length to which 30 46-bp tandem repeats are tethered, but a larger variant of this repeat with a 63-bp long internal region is also present. The internal 63-bp region of this internal variant contains 15 adenine residues and 1 cytosine. An A + T bias (62.1%) is also seen in the DNA repeat. These tandem repeats form a G-quadruplex structure that is enriched in thiophosphate DNA. An additional 22 of such repeats are located immediately upstream and downstream of the internal region of the G-quadruplex structure. Thus, the DNA repeat has 390 copies of the DNA repeats spanning 12 kb of the DNA.

To assess long-term outcome in our patients, we retrospectively analysed those who received an ICD for LQTS between April 2000 and December 2010. The primary endpoint was first appropriate ICD therapy. Secondary endpoints included arrhythmic death and VAs captured by Holter monitoring. A total of 89 patients were included. Fifty-one LQTS patients (58%) carried a mutation in one of the known LQTS genes. Of the 89 patients, 31 (35%) received appropriate therapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 27 (30%) for ventricular fibrillation (VF). First appropriate ICD therapy occurred within the first 48 months of follow-up in 84% of patients. Arrhythmic death occurred in 4 LQTS patients (6%) and occurred in less than 5 years after ICD implantation in three of these patients.

The radioactivity of the released free amino acids was first examined by paper chromatography. This work clearly demonstrated that the rate of conversion of amino acids to carbohydrate was markedly reduced under conditions of hyperglycemia. The radioactivity of leucine labeled by orotic acid was examined in both intact hepatocytes and in hepatocytl suspensions. The results demonstrated that the degradation of amino acids to CO2 and water was markedly inhibited by hyperglycemia in both the intact hepatocytes and in the hepatocytl suspensions. Addition of insulin, although it augmented the rate of conversion of amino acids into carbon-14 labelled carbohydrate in cells of normal liver to the same level as in the diabetic, had only a slight effect in the cells obtained from the diabetic rats. It is suggested that the defect in the conversion of amino acids into glucose that occurs in cells of diabetic liver might be in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.<EOD> A case of disseminated toxoplasmosis.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 70-year-old female with dizziness, vomiting and vertigo, nausea and stomach pain, chills and headaches and abdominal pain, and fevers and rashes.

In future research, we aim to provide separate modules to detect different elements of clinical trial eligibility and apply the module to the dataset with more types of elements.\n<EOD> The relationship of the endometrial glands and the vascular compartment in the nonhuman primate.\nThis study examines the relationship between the endometrial glands and the blood vessel network in the rhesus monkey endometrium. To achieve this purpose, sections of the uterine corpus of four normal monkeys in the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle were examined with the scanning electron microscope. The data of the present investigation show that the endometrium in rhesus monkeys is characterized by a rich glycogenated cellular content, an abundant gland network, and a vascular compartment composed of capillaries and venules. A large number of glands is observed in the basal endometrium of the corpus uteri, while the number of glands diminishes with increasing distance from the basal plane (surface of the endometrium). The glandular network decreases during the secretory phase. This decrease is more evident in the upper part of the endometrium. An evident depletion of secretory granules occurs in glands with increasing distance from the uterine surface. Numerous capillaries can be recognized in the corpus uteri throughout the entire menstrual cycle in the rhesus monkeys. No special features with regard to their morphology and disposition can be easily recognized. The vascular network changes, however, during the menstrual cycle. Capillaries in the proliferative phase are characterized by the presence of irregularly shaped vesicles or by the presence of electron-dense granules on the periphery of the endothel",

The average age of the young patients was 33 and 34 years for those with right-sided and left-sided tumors, respectively. More young male patients were found to have left-sided tumors (35%) than in the general population, but this was not statistically significant (27%). Young patients were more likely to develop tumors within the proctosigmoid junction than were older patients. A large proportion of these young patients were found to have invasive disease (56%). Nearly one third had nodal metastases in the supracervical, presacral, or pelvic region, but only one had lymph node metastases to a supraclavicular level. A total of 39.6% of patients with Dukes' A disease had no adverse prognostic indicators identified; this percentage was not significantly different from that associated with older patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the Douala and Yaounde areas, capital cities of Cameroon. Methods: We conducted a comparative cross-sectional analysis of a non-probability sample from six urban and rural areas in northern Cameroon (Douala and Ngoatoumou) and three regions (Mount Cameroon, West, and North West Cameroon) from October 2011 to October 2012. Participants were screened for hypertensive disease and albuminuria by selfreport and spot urine protein:creatinine ratio. Those screening-positive were further evaluated for chronic disease according to the K/DOQI standards. Multivariate logistic regression models were calculated to measure associations of each hypertension-associated risk factor with chronic kidney disease (CKD) presence and severity. Results: A total of 404 subjects participated in the study (64.1% in urban and 35.9% in rural areas). The overall prevalence of hypertension from this cohort was 27.5%, and proteinuria was prevalent in 27.3%. One hundred and twenty subjects (29.9%) had CKD, of which 16.5% had moderate to advanced CKD (eGFR <45 mls/minute). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the adjusted associations with factors found CKD demonstrated a significant OR of 6.95 for hypertension, and 3.99 for proteinuria (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.47 -12.27), respectively (all p-values< 0.001). Proteinuria was found to be a stronger predictor of CKD presence and severity than hypertensive disease. Other factors that contributed to CKD presence in both the urban and rural areas included female sex, smoking (both past and current smoking) and increased age (OR 7.55",

Subjects and Methods: A total of 161 Saudi Arab non-pregnant female were enrolled in the study. Their ages were within the range of 15 to 80 years old. 70 females (47.7%) had a BMD Tscore \u22121 or less, and the rest 91 females (52.3%) showed a normal BMD. Their serum leptin concentrations were measured and their association with the BMD was determined. Results: No statistically significant difference in serum leptin concentrations could be detected when age groups between 15 to 40 or 40 to 80 years of age were compared. However; there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the serum leptin levels and the BMD T-score. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between leptin levels, weight and height. A strong positive correlation between BMD and leptin levels were found among those having normal BMD while there was no correlation among those females having low BMD when comparing patients based on the clinical history. Conclusion: These results indicate that there is a clear association between serum leptin level and BMD especially with normal BMD and leptin level.\n\n# Introduction\nLeptin is made by fat cells and is the main molecular signal that informs the brain of the amount of fat an individual holds [bib_ref]  Obesity and leptin resistance: distinguishable components of the cardiometabolic syndrome, Prager [/bib_ref] .

When there is more fat, the body makes more leptin and sends more information to the brain, telling the human not to eat as much. Leptin is produced only when the fat cells are full. Thus, you do not get hungry when full, and you feel hungry when you are running low. It is now clear that lept",

A case cohort study. Objective. To identify and quantify the relationship between cervical lordosis and cervical spine function before and after anterior cervical decompression and arthroplasty. Summary of Background Data. Proper cervical lordosis is important to reduce stress on the cervical spine and improve motion. Loss of lordosis has been reported after anterior cervical decompression and arthroplasty (ACDA). The authors hypothesized that loss of lordosis has an adverse effect on cervical spine function. Methods. Twenty patients with unilateral radiculopathy of the upper extremity were treated with ACDF from June 2002 to February 2003 and subsequently followed with postoperative plain radiographs. In addition, 11 patients treated with ACDA from April 2000 to July 2002 were followed with cervical spine computed tomography scans and standing cervical X-rays for measurement of lordosis. The clinical outcomes were evaluated and compared with the radiographic parameters of the cervical spine. ACDA patients were further analyzed based on the degree of lordosis. Results. Radiographic and clinical outcomes were not significantly different between patients with lordosis (group 1, mean anterior lordosis; 9.9\u00b0 \u00b1 2.8\u00b0 and normal lordosis; 5.4\u00b0 \u00b1 2.2\u00b0) and without lordosis (group 2, 2.1\u00b0; P > 0.05).

Cystic renal cell carcinoma (RC) was defined as the presence of cystic cavity with or without cyst wall and/or intrarenal tumor (RC) which was greater than 1/2 of the total tumor volume. A total of 93 cases of renal cell carcinoma which had cystic renal cell carcinoma and other 941 cases of renal cell carcinoma without cystic renal cell carcinoma (RC) were randomly collected. Overall survival rates of 691, 818, and 900 days are 84.0%, 75.9%, and 68.2% in patients with 1 cystic renal cell carcinoma, 2 cystic renal cell carcinoma, and 3 cystic renal cell carcinoma, respectively. Survival is lower in patients with synchronous cystic tumor than patients with nonsynchronous cystic tumor (72.9% versus 73.6%, = 0.001). The presence of cystic renal cell carcinoma does not compromise the effect of other synchronous tumors in overall survival of renal cell carcinoma.\n\n# Introduction\nIt has been reported that about 25% of renal tumors showed solid-cystic component, and some studies found an increase in cases of kidney tumors since 197",

The inclination of the biceps femoris was measured with the muscle belly of the medial hamstrings in a knee-flexed position. To evaluate the intrarater and interrater reliability, we randomly selected 20 healthy adults (male:female = 9:11) from among 40 volunteers to assess the test-retest, interrater, and intrarater reliabilities. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement, and minimum detectable change for the intrarater and interrater (ICC2,1) reliability were calculated. The agreement and validity of Myotool and GaitRite systems were calculated by the Bland\u2013Altman method. The limits of agreement ranged from \u22123.57 to 4.37 for GaitRite, \u20141.69 to 3.20 for Myotool, and \u20143.59 to 4.47 for the sensor.

Your task is to calculate the p-value for the efficacy of the trial. Once the trial is complete, you will try to predict the mean value of `BloodGlucose` under each group. A clinical trial is a study that seeks to assess the efficacy and safety of new drugs. In clinical trial, patients are randomly assigned to the group (usually two groups) of treatment or control. Patients in the group will receive an active treatment, while those in the control group will receive a treatment that is inactive. Efficacy measures the benefit, or lack of harm, of the treatment. In this tutorial, the study design uses the control group. The primary outcome is blood glucose, and the secondary outcome is HR.\n\nIf we are looking for efficacy, we focus on the differences between two groups and look for statistically significant differences. To calculate the p-value to assess the statistical difference between the two groups, the first thing is to calculate the difference, i.e., obtain the means of `BloodGlucose` and `HR`. Then we need to test `H 0`. \n\nFirst, the data frame should be as follows:\nYou would have to code the `BloodGlucose` and `HR `as `m1` and `m2`, and you could code `group` as `m3`.\n\nNow we need to conduct a t-test on each group.

METHODS A retrospective medical record review was conducted on all the adult patients admitted to ICU between July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2008. Each admitted patient was assessed for the presence or absence of MRSA at ICU admission and at discharge. Possible risk factors for MRSA colonization were evaluated, including patient demographics, clinical conditions at the time of admission, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, and the LOS in the hospital. Patient comorbid diseases were classified with the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) system. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who were not colonized at ICU admission (group A) and patients who were MRSA colonized at ICU admission (group B). The logistic regression model was used to identify the association between the potential risk variables and the development of MRSA colonization in patients during ICU stay. The model was constructed by using the likelihood method of generalized estimating equations and all variables were analyzed as categorical variables. A significant level of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 706 patients were",

        "output": "> [INST] Let's find out the best and worst outcomes per each variable.\n\nIn this section, we will analyze how much the decision impact of each variable (e.g., patient gender and CVID) varies, which is called variable importance. The more the decision impact varies across the values for each variable, the more important the variable is. To measure the decision impact a variable has, we compute the reduction of the number of the correct classifications by making the value of the variable artificially identical for all patient patients. If a decision tree makes use of a variable, we then add a constant to that variable for all patients to make its value identical across the population of patients. If a decision tree does not use a variable, we add an artificial classification for all patients and set the target label to that of the artificial classification. Here, we artificially make all patients male. That is, all patients with the feature `male = 0` will be classified to the class '2); otherwise the class '1). Similarly, we make all of the patients in the dataset (a) positive; or (b) with CVID. If we are going to make the target value equal to 1, the decision tree will split by the variable.\nIf a variable is split, its importance is the reduction of the number of correct classifications while we set the target value to 2 and make the rest of variables artificially identical. If a variable is an internal leaf/terminal node, its importance can be measured as the reduction of the number of correct classifications while this variable is set to be constant across the dataset while we set the rest of variables artificially identical. \nLet's find the variable importance per the tree generated for the dataset in the previous section. We will find out who are most eligible to be recruited for this clinical trial using the decision tree we built for the patients of the dataset. \n     >>> 1. The first variable we make artificially identical across the dataset is sex.

Your supervisor has received a request by the research nurse to develop an eligibility assessment form for clinical trials that you will implement in your workplace. You are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity to help the research nurse. You may search the Internet to find instructions on this topic. You find an online document that provides instructions for applying [INST] to create the form you need.\n\nUse the template that you find on the [INST] website to create a form to assess patient eligibility for a clinical trial. You can also download the template as a Word document. When you create the document, you just need to type the information that is in red in the template. If you are typing the information directly, do not forget to highlight the required text using the \"Formatting marks\" toolbar in Word (the question mark (?) should be visible at the top of the toolbar).\n\nYou use your workbook to create the template. After you finish, just download the document.\n\nAfter creating a form, you will need to save it. If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, you should click the Save As button to choose the location of the document. Then, click the File Properties option, and change the layout to Standard.\n\nNext, the application creates an Excel spreadsheet based on the information in the Microsoft Word file and imports the data from the file. To test this, you go to the menu:\n\n### Menu > Insert > Field Code\n\nThe form should appear, as shown next. You will notice that it has the same format with the template on the [INST] website, just with the data from the Word file imported.\n\n# The Research Process\n[institute] offers an interesting template with the information you require to find and analyze the best evidence.

However, in India, there have been no systematic or routine attempts at registration of all ongoing or completed clinical trials. On reviewing the 2,184 registered clinical trials available in the Indian clinical trial registry, Indian clinical trial registry (www.ctri.nic.in), it was seen that clinical trial registration of a particular study in the public domain was often incomplete or deficient. This study focuses on assessing whether Indian clinical trial registries are adequately meeting legal and societal obligations toward research ethics, transparency, and patient protection for clinical trials.\n\n## Clinical trial registries\nAccording to the definition given by the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, a clinical trial is \"any investigation in human subjects intended to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of any human disease treatment\". The aim of clinical trials in medicine is to determine whether or not a particular treatment is more beneficial than a commonly used treatment (in the treatment of a disease, e.g., an infection), no different from one another (e.g., an antidepressant being equally effective for all patients with depression), or more detrimental (resulting in an adverse reaction) or toxicity to patients than another existing treatment. Clinical trials are also undertaken to identify new prophylactic, diagnostic (prevention of disease/diagnosis of disease), and screening tests, and to determine the optimal dosage of an existing medication and new medications more efficacious than an existing one.\nThe process of clinical research and the ethical and legal issues that surround such research have been extensively described by the Indian Council of Medical Research [bib_ref]  The ICMR ethical guidelines: where do we stand today?, Kaushal [/bib_ref] .

The mean sCD8 level in RTR patients (1844 \u00b1 3539 ng/ml) was significant lower than that in HIV positive group (p=0.012). In the correlation analysis, sCD8 had statistically significant positive correlation with the CD38 (rHIV = 0.81 p<0.0001, rRTR = 0.33, p=0.48). However, correlation of sCD8 with IL6 and HLADR was not significant.ConclusionHIV and RTR patients had lower sCD8 level, HIV patients had higher CRP. Although CR",

Because the first one is 6 months, thus we need only the third and the second are not required. This is a good example to understand this process of eligibility test. So you also can understand other test such as 2nd or 4th value of patient's sex and so on.  \n\n# Mood\n\nThis is a mood test based on the fact that it takes more time to make a decision at a neutral mood than at an emotional mood. It is also known that clinicians tend to be much faster in their decision-making when in a happy mood as compared to when in a sad mood. The clinicians used for this evaluation should be physicians. If the patient does not speak English, then the clinicians should be people who speak both English and the patient's native language.\n\nHere is an example of a mood test for eligibility.\nYou are a clinician for a clinical trial to treat osteolytic metastases. The clinical trial requires patients who are over the age of 18 with bone metastases from breast or prostate cancer. In addition, they require an abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level greater than 1\u00a0ng/mL (3\u00a0ng/L), and one of the following: multiple bone lesions, or lesions at both long bones and vertebrae.

The number of data sets in all analyses: 483, number of data sets for which the scale type type differs significantly: 5\n- `target_type_string`: `The probability that the Target Value is greater than 0.5 is 0.00% `\n\nSince the latter, 0.00%, and the former, 0.001125, are very small, and both are less than 0.05, we assume that at least one scale with a different scale type is significantly more used. You can see this information in [here][NOTE] in [Section 3.2][NOTE]. \n\n``scale with more samples`` means the ``scale`` with a smaller p-value. Since `Target_Value_0` is the most (`352`) and `Scale_Type_2` has the least (`178`), it is the scale called `Scale_Type_2` for your assessment. Thus, two scales are used in the assessment of the clinical trial. \nNow, we will think more deeply, what if each scale has two different scales. If `Scale_Type_2` and `Scale_Type_4` are used for a trial, how much can the scale differ?

        "output": "[INST] Hello again. You are the chief investigator of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the incidence and severity of infections in pediatric cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and G-CSF. Infections cause a substantial economic impact to health care systems, as well as burden and unnecessary suffering for patients and families. Increasing evidence suggests a role for immunomodulatory therapy in protecting against infections in immunocompromised patients. Intrinsic to the successful conduct of RCTs in pediatric immunocompromised patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and immune suppressive therapies is the optimal protection of recruited patients.\n\nIn the chemotherapy schedule for this RCT , we wish to test whether G-CSF will result in fewer infections. Therefore, the inclusion criteria must be selected that will allow for the greatest possible safety, as well as adequacy for the comparison of infection rates between the two treatment strategies (G-CSF vs no G-CSF). The study's inclusion criteria for pediatric hematology/oncology patients must be written so that they do not result in any significant additional morbidity or increased length of stay. Also, any inclusion criteria that would bias the study cohort towards a healthier patient population would compromise the trial's ability to detect a potential difference between treatment arms. [INST] \n[INTERN] As shown in these two patients, the side effects observed most often associated with GCSF are headache, bone pain, arthralgia, pain at the injection site, fever, nausea, chills, vomiting, hypotension/hyporesponsive, edema, diarrhea, and other constitutional symptoms. The primary purpose of the study is to test whether GCSF or GM-CSF will result in fewer infections in pediatric immune compromised patients. Therefore, in order to test the hypothesis that GCSF vs GCSF+ chemotherapy has fewer infections (both severe and less severe infections), the inclusion criteria must be written so that the patient population will not be biased to the GCSF+ group compared to chemotherapy alone. In order to do this,  the exclusion criteria for GCSF+",

Methods: A total of 91 patients in an urban HIV clinic who were 50 years or older were recruited from May 2009 to March 2010. Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), which is a measure of HRQOL, disability, and other measures of health and well-being.

The hernia repair consisted in posterior fixation of the internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscles and, in 22 cases, in an abdominal flap closure of the posterior wall of the hernia. The surgical mortality was 2%, the frequency of intestinal reoperations--in 10%. In the post-operative period of 3 months--6 months a recurrence rate of hernias was recorded in 14.2%, after a year--in 12.2% and in 2 years--in 8.5%. During follow-up of 12 years a recurrence rate (6 patients) averaged 2.1%. In 14 (29%) patients the authors found pain in the postoperative period; such a pain was located in the perineum (4 patients), in the sacral region (7 cases) and in the inguinal region--in 3 patients. The inguinal pain was eliminated by the operation in the preperitoneal region. In the authors' opinion, the suture of the posterior wall of hernias is ineffective.

Two thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone (RSG) and pioglitazone (PGZ), are potent activators of PPAR\u2010\u03b3. In this work we investigated the effects of both drugs in human preadipocytes in order to obtain more insight into the different mechanisms of PPAR\u2010\u03b3 transactivation. Both drugs were effective in inducing adipocyte differentiation and increasing adiponectin secretion. While PGZ increased intracellular ROS levels, induced cell cycle delay and inhibited leptin secretion, RSG did not modify the above listed parameters.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of egg white hydrolysate (EWH) on lipid metabolism and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were cultured, without or with EWH and insulin, for 8 or 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT reduction assay. The effect of EWH and insulin on lipid accumulation was analyzed by the Oil Red O technique; gene expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and proteins expression was evaluated by Western blot. EWH did not affect cell viability or the uptake of 3 H-palmitic acid. Although EWH did not induce adipogenesis, it increased cholesterol efflux and lipoprotein lipase activity, as well as the expression of \u03bc-and \u03b2-ARs, CideB and Acs. Moreover, EWH reduced the expression of adipogenic transcription factors (p< 0.05) and CideA gene (p< 0.0001) after 24 h of stimulation. EWH also induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 ERK1/2; while insulin, decreased LKB1/AMPK/ACC2/ HSL pathway. Overall, these results indicated that EWH and insulin modulated lipid metabolism and lipogenesis of preadipocytes. EWH exerts potential bioactive effects via modulation of lipid metabolism and lipogenesis by targeted molecular mechanism. These mechanisms are implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism in cells of preadipocyte origin and suggest the potential use of EWH to prevent obesity.\n\n# Introduction\nObesity is considered a \"modern epidemic\" that threatens to cause a significant decrease in human life",

        "output": "[INST] Clinical trials are generally designed to compare the new treatment being tested against existing treatments. The goal of a clinical trial is to reduce uncertainty in decision-making on medical treatment options. It takes years to complete a clinical trial. \n\nFor the above clinical trial, the following two comparative questions can be asked. Let's analyze each one of them using the CDR.\n\nFor Question 1, compare the new treatment based on the inclusion criteria. The two factors we have to focus on are:\n\n- the clinical status of the patient\n- the patient's medical health record\nWe have a note for a patient with a urine output of less than 0.2 mL/kg/hr shortly after undergoing major surgery. However, there are no eligibility criteria that include the type of patient illness. Since the CDR is about medical condition as the primary factor, we should make a medical judgment about the patient medical health record, e.g., a urine output of less than 0.2 mL/kg/hr shortly after undergoing major surgery.\nWhen the above is applied to this clinical trial, we need to compare the patient medical health record with the trial eligibility criteria.\n\n\n\nFor Question 2, compare the patients that are eligible based on the inclusion criteria. We need two factors: \n- the clinical status of the patient\n- the patient's medical health record\nThe patient in the given note has a urine output of less than 0.2 mL/kg/hr shortly after undergoing major surgery. However, the health condition is not mentioned. When we refer the patient's medical history, the patient notes that the patient has undergone major surgery, and there should have been no major postoperative complications during the day of surgery that the urine output is less than 0.2 mL/kg/hr. Then, a patient with a history of major surgery can be compared with the trial inclusion criteria.

Low-level laser (LLL) irradiation was used to treat cultured primary rat hepatocytes in order to determine its effect on cell metabolism and particularly the effect on the content of Cys in the cell and extracellular pools. LLL irradiation resulted in a significant increase in Cys concentration in the intracellular cell matrix and on the membrane surface of the hepatocytes. The increase seen could not be explained by any increased uptake of Cys from the incubation medium. Rather LLL irradiation, possibly due to increased cellular permeability, allows a greater concentration of extracellular Cys molecules to pass through the outer cell membrane, thereby increasing the intracellular Cys concentration.<EOD> Identification and characterisation of the human GPI-anchored glyceroglycolipid, lysocardiolipin, by electrospray mass spectrometry.\nFatty aldehydes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors of eukaryotic glycolipids.

The focus was on the narratives they constructed to deal with and make sense of the situation. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 women and 1 man with children aged 10 to 18 years. Questions and prompts explored emotions, impacts, resilience strategies, and what they expected as long-term consequences of the crisis. Data were obtained between July 31, 2020 and July 27, 2021. Results: The interviews contained stories in which parents attempted to make sense of the past and future of their children and to plan a way forward. Stories about the past focused on moments of panic, despair, and powerlessness. In contrast, narratives about the future emphasized resilience, independence, and being able to take charge of things. Conclusions: Parents construct narratives in order to make sense of this crisis and to navigate their children's developmental paths.

The presence of such antisense TEs has been taken to indicate, as recently reported in Maureen Wheeler's group and others, that TEs can jump in concert in a process they call 'transposase-mediated integration' (TMI). This study investigates the origin of antisense TEs and proposes a general model of their generation. The analysis shows that in most instances of TEs on the same chromosome on opposite strands, one strand has two TEs in a direct head-to-head or tail-to-tail orientation suggesting that these antisense copies may have originated through strand-slippage of TEs during transposition. This simple model, which is consistent with the observations, has never been considered. Strand-slippage TEs (SST) were found in a wide range of organisms including fungi, plant and animal genomes, but in none of these organisms do TMI events occur.

As you may know, a trial has a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Therefore, the clinical trials that match a screened patient should satisfy these criteria. First, you should find all the trials to which you have applied in the patient list by running a user-defined search with keywords like the patient name. For example, let's find the trials that we are currently participating in patient named `Aaron Johnson`. In this particular case, there is only one trial that matches the patient, named Trial-level eligibility: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial.`\n\nYou should provide a list of trials to which you have applied, and make sure that you get a complete list of the trials, including completed trials that have yet to be published, for those patients. Then, you can find trials that match each patient by comparing the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials you are screening to those of patient's trials.\n\nPlease note that some clinical trials provide specific details for the inclusion and exclusion criteria in their paper format instead of the CDE. In that case, it is also good idea to refer to the paper format of the trial to include the trial details in CDE for patient matching.\n\nAlso note that trial identifier is the key in finding the trial to which we are applying. We just need to find the trial identifier of the patient to match the patient to the trials.\n\nIn the current version, the eligible patients are automatically matched to the relevant trials. This is the default behavior; but you may need to turn off the feature by setting `autoTrialsToScreen` to \"no\", to see whether you have missed trials. It is good practice to reanalyze the screening results when this option is employed.\n\n\n\n### 22.26 | Tutorial (Trial)\n\nHere is a quick tutorial on a trial screening.

A systematic review of the past 70 years of research has found that much of traditional educational research focused on the process and outcome of medical education, with little interest in outcomes such as the cost of medical education, clinical competence, and quality of clinical service with respect to patients or society[1]. It noted that as compared to the traditional teacher training, the literature on competencybased medical education (CBME) was more detailed, and the methodologies more rigorous and comprehensive.It stated that despite some barriers to implementation, CBME is highly successful in helping medical schools align their curricula to their educational objectives and to the skills, competencies and attributes necessary to function on their workplaces. The review further showed that, as compared to conventional programmes, CBME is better supported by faculty members and more appropriate to their needs. It also found that student feedback was positive towards CBME but suggested that more empirical research is needed with regard to the cost-effectiveness of CBME. This systematic review provided compelling evidence that CBME is a highly successful educational model and encourages other medical schools to consider and adopt it [1,",

Your task is to evaluate a patient's progression after treatment by assessing the rate of tumor progression and survival.\n\nTumors of the brain can be grouped into two major classes. The first, glioblastoma multiforme, has an extremely high level of malignancy. It typically appears in younger patients, accounts for approximately 55% to 60% of primary tumors, and has an annual mortality rate of 7% to 10%. The second category includes the lower malignant grade tumors. They are typically found in an older personage, account for 20% to 35% of primary tumors, and have an approximate doubling time of 5 to 7 years.\n        \n        The goal of your analysis is to compare the progressiveness and mortality of lower-grade vs high-grade tumors over a specific time period. To accomplish this task, you will use data from the TCGA database containing genetic signatures of 51 tumors of patients who had newly diagnosed brain cancer, 26 glioblastomas (high grade) and 25 lower-grade gliomas (LGG).\n\n        Glial tumors are tumors that involve the supporting tissue of the brain and spinal cord .

Despite maximal calorie intake, sixty percent of very low birth weight infants still fail to thrive suggesting that factors other than total calorie intake are important in ensuring consistent weight gain. Several reports have indicated a positive sodium balance is critical in ensuring good weight gain in very low birth weight infants, however these infants are susceptible to low serum sodium concentrations. Urine sodium values are sometimes used to diagnosis of hyponatremia or negative sodium balance after the first two weeks of life, but there is no evidence for this practice in preterm neonates. Our central hypothesis is that early supplementation with sodium will ensure positive sodium balance in very low birth weight infants and will result in optimal weight gain and enhanced long term outcomes. Secondarily we hypothesize that low sodium concentrations in the urine will not correlate with low serum sodium values.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\ninfants born at less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age\n\n#### Expected Output\n\nSodium Supplementation, and Growth in Very Low Birth Weight",

CD44 is expressed in normal and tumor tissues. The expression of CD44 receptor in tumor cells is associated with metastasis, tumorigenesis, and treatment resistance. CD44 has four hyaluronic acid binding domains (HABDs) as well as additional domains that are responsible for specificity. Extensive studies on CD44 HABDs indicate that HABDs serve as the primary interface and that secondary sites within the HABDs and the hinge region contribute to the specificity of recognition of HA. HABDs are implicated in adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells (ECs) as well as other cancer cells, fibroblasts, and monocytes. Therefore, an interaction between HABDs of CD44 and hyaluronic acid is recognized as a potential target in cancer metastasispredicting. In this study, we review the role of CD44 in inflammation and cancer and in inflammation-mediated cancer.<EOD> A multicenter study on the risk factors for atherogenesis in Japanese schoolchildren.

Plasma levels of propranolol were decreased by prior administration of caffeine (5 mg/kg) or metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg), but metoprolol given at 1.5 mg/kg did not affect plasma levels of propranolol. 3. Prior administration of metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg) or caffeine (5 mg/kg) or metoprolol (1.5 mg/kg) caused an increase in the apparent volume of distribution of propranolol from 11.9 l/kg to approximately 19 l/kg. 4. Caffeine was rapidly metabolized in all subjects, but caffeine did not appear to affect the metabolism of propranolol. 5. Prior administration of metoprolol significantly decreased the metabolic clearance rate of propranolol (3.8 vs. 2.1 l/min) and increased the unbound concentration of propranolol in plasma. 6. Caffeine given at 5 mg/kg significantly decreased the metabolic clearance rate of propranolol from 3.8 l/min to 2.6 l/min. 7.

When standing up from sitting for a meal, he felt lightheaded, lost his balance, and fell to the floor, banging his head against a wall. He did not lose consciousness. There has been none history of fainting, seizures, or loss of consciousness, and no family history of convulsive syncope or sudden cardiac death. His medical history is significant for morbid obesity, asthma, and nonverbalism. He is a right-handed male with excellent fine motor skills and speech and social skills. He was recently admitted to the emergency room for an upper respiratory tract infection.\n        Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Syncope Trial (SAPS vs AF)\n\n\nSummary: Syncope accounts for 1-3% of office visits, 5% to 39% of emergency department visits, and 8% of all hospital admissions worldwide.1 Syncope is typically caused by transient cerebral ischemia due to bradycardia.2 It rarely but nonetheless can be a harbinger of life-threatening arrhythmias (for example, sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brugada Syndrome, LQT3) or cardiomyopathies.1 Although the annual incidence of syncope is as high as 10% in the general population at least half of all cases remain idiopathic. Therefore, many patients with a first syncopal event are started on a 12 lead ECG, Holter monitoring, or an ambulatory ECG monitor to try to determine the cause of the event.

We hypothesized that a combined treatment with dual RFA zones and the MitraClip System would enhance the reduction of MR and have more favorable patient outcomes.Methods and Results--The DREAM (dual RFA zoning and MitraClip System with or without MitraClip for secondary mitral regurgitation due to HF) study was a prospective, randomized single-blinded trial performed at 6 medical centers in the Netherlands and Belgium. Patients eligible for MitraClip implantation with severe MR grade 3 or 4 on echocardiography and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were randomized to either dual RFA with the MitraClip System or surgical sham. The primary endpoint was the reduction of MR severity from baseline to 52 weeks' follow-up, assessed as dichotomized (present/absent) or quantified by the mean mitral regurgitation fraction. Secondary endpoints were changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and 6-minute walking distance. From October 2011 until March 2016 a total of 18 patients were treated in the dual RFA zone group, whereas 10 were treated in the surgical sham group.

The purpose of clinical trials is to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention and its effects on the participants. The inclusion criteria are factors that determine the trial participants' eligibility. If a trial's purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention on patients with a certain age and health condition, all patients in that age group and health condition constitute the target group of that trial. In order to determine the patients for a trial, there must be eligibility evaluations according to certain criteria. In these evaluations, first of all, it is important to check the participants' demographic and health characteristics. Second, the specific health diagnosis of the patients must be checked. After this step, the health information of the patients is taken into consideration. Finally, some assessments to be made during the clinical trial are checked. As a part of the assessment, some evaluations are conducted based on the participant's body measurements. In addition, some evaluations are done based on the participants' lifestyle. In order to perform a trial-level eligibility evaluation, a 3-point scale is used. This scale has the information of patient referral status. 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the information such as: Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial, Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation, Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial, respectively. To do the patient-level eligibility check, let's choose the information in line 19-37 as a patient sample to calculate. \nHere are these information: \nFirst of all, it is important to examine the age information. If the age information is less than 21, it is accepted that the participant is a child. On the other hand, if the patient is a child, and the condition that has affected the patient is Diabetes Mellitus Insipidus, it is also accepted that the patient has a health diagnosis. Because, the participants who have children with the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Insipidus, are included the trial.\nAs another example, let's choose the information in line 53",

That means that after we have examined the inclusion criteria, we need to be consistent in how we judge a patient's eligibility. So, if when considering a patient for the clinical trial, we judge that the patient is not likely to qualify, then we should do that consistently across all patients.

They should have a large optical absorbance covering the entire visible range of the solar spectrum, moderate HOMO and LUMO energy levels, well-defined dipolar moment, high hole and electron mobility, and high electron affinity.However, these properties are interdependent due to the presence of a substantial amount of conjugated and non-conjugated parts in the copolymers. The molecular-electronic structures of copolymers have been predicted using ab initio calculations, empirical method, and experimental techniques such as IR, Raman, and ESR spectroscopy, 9-12 XPS,UV/Vis,and EPR spectroscopy.However, these methods have serious limitations. The ab initio methods are computationally demanding, the empirical methods can not model well molecular structures of copolymers with a large amount of atoms or electrons (more than \u2248 500 atoms), Raman and ESR methods can not be applied to a broad spectrum of vibration or radical, and the XPS and UV/Vis methods can not give information on the chemical bonds and electronic structure of the molecule and its subunit. These limitations of these experimental methods should be satisfied with theoretical calculations.\nIn the present study, we have developed a method that is capable of modeling the molecule-electronic structures of copolymers that can be used in optoelectronic devices.\nOur method calculates electronic energy levels of a large molecule on a PC workstation in ca. 1-2 min,",

The government and medical profession urged people to stay at home to limit the spread of the virus. Consequently, the Dutch medical education changed rapidly and students were obliged to stay at home. This study aims to investigate the impact of this pandemic on medical students based in the Netherlands. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by all Dutch medical students that were currently attending the clinical phase of medical education between February 15 and March 15, 2020 (N=2696). An online questionnaire was developed with questions that were based on the theoretical framework derived from the literature. Statistical tests were performed to calculate differences according to selected student characteristics and to identify factors that were associated with self-reported feelings of anxiety. Results: Medical students from all universities reported experiencing a major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in their education and life in general. Students from Radboud University felt most impacted as compared to students from other universities (e.g. percentage of canceled educational activities: 73.0% versus 61.2-65.9%, p<0.001). The majority of students reported feelings of anxiety: 75% of the medical students in their final year (6 out of 8 answers) and from VU felt anxious as compared to 59% and 55% from Radboud University to 54% and 46% from UMCU.Conclusions: This research demonstrated that medical students in the Netherlands were severely affected in their study abroad caused by COVID-19. The results show that there is still a lot of variation amongst universities in the way students were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and how medical schools supported them. This has large implications for how future online and virtual learning is implemented and how academic organizations support their students, especially in times of",

This latter cascade is composed of two proteins, encoded by GIC2 (STE11) and STE4, with two and one kinase domain, respectively. We have shown that PKA associates and specifically interacts with Vph1 only when its catalytic domain is phosphorylated suggesting that PKA and the MAPK module could be interacting and co-regulating gene expression, possibly through the 61 KDa subunit BCY1. This hypothesis was proposed after demonstration that Vph1 and Gic2 interact in an extract of S. cerevisiae cells and in vitro. Indeed, Gic2 interacted with Vph1 in an in vitro assay and the specificity was demonstrated with Cak1, a protein kinase structurally related to Gic2. This specificity is also present in yeast in vivo since the Cak1p-VPH1 association is less significant than GIC2-VPH1 association in a cell extract from S. cerevisiae, which is in agreement with our previous result showing that Vph1 is specifically phosphorylated by MAPK pathway when pheromones are present. Indeed, upon pheromone treatment, Vph1 was isolated in the yeast immunoprecipitate when GIC2 or CAP (catalytical subunit of MAPK) was present. On the same way, Vph1 was found in the yeast immunoprecipitate Cak1.2, the catalytic subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase type Cak1p.

Bovine \u03b2-glycosidase solution containing enzyme and inhibitor was maintained at pH 4.5 under aerobic conditions at room temperature in 0.1 M H2O2. In the absence of H2O2, sodium arsenate had no effect on the activity of \u03b2-galactosidase, although its addition resulted in the inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase in the presence of H2O2. Sodium arsenate decreased the value of kobs, in agreement with the apparent inhibition of the degradation of the active center tyrosine of \u03b2-galactosidase by H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide at low concentrations and sodium arsenate at high concentrations inhibited the degradation of the active center tyrosine in the \u03b2-galactosidase. Arsenic also prevented the degradation of Tyr 452 in bovine \u03b2-galactosidase by H2O2. Consequently, arsenic ion would reduce the covalent bond formation of the active center tyrosine of \u03b2-galactosidase through the oxidation of the tyrosine residue to an aldehyde group by H2O2.

Spontaneously active afferent and efferent neuronal pathways from muscle, skin and viscera were isolated functionally by using a new technique based on a double sucrose gap method. 2 Noradrenaline, at concentrations of 0.2, 2 and 20 \u03bcM, increased the postganglionic efferent neurotransmitter release dose\u2010dependently without having any effect on evoked postganglionic responses and afferent activity. On the other hand, the concentration of 20 \u03bcM of adrenaline or isoprenaline had a stimulatory effect on both postganglionic efferent and afferent responses in all the pathways investigated. The latter agent had a stronger stimulatory action than adrenaline. 3 Clonidine, at concentrations 0.2, 2 and 20 \u03bcM, suppressed spontaneously occurring sympathetic and cardiovascular efferent and postganglionic responses without affecting afferent activity. 4 At all doses tested clonidine suppressed excitatory and inhibitory responses to electrical stimulation of postganglionic and afferent pathways, respectively. Different doses of clonidine also affected the postganglionic efferent responses to different extents. 5 The results indicate a high sensitivity of vertebral muscle, visceral and skin afferent neurons to peripheral sympathetic stimuli and to the spinal sympathetic outflow within the vertebral body. The results further indicate that the sympathetic nervous system in this preparation is more sensitive to adrenaline or isoprenaline and less sensitive to clonidine than the cardiovascular system.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development of PDAC, as well as provide potential therapeutic approaches to PDAC, it has been seldom studied in clinical trials. To this end, the present study aimed to explore the potential functional roles and therapeutic targets of miRNAs in PDAC. MiRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A comprehensive comparison of miRNA expression profiles between tumors and normal specimens was conducted. In addition, correlation analysis was used to determine the interactions between miRNAs and the mRNAs. In-depth functional annotation of miRNAs and mRNAs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Based on the integrated mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed using DIANA-mirPath. Overall survival (OS) analysis and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to determine the association of 9 differentially expressed miRNAs with PDAC prognosis. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in PDAC in an unbiased manner, we developed miRNA-gene interaction networks using Cytoscape \n\n\n3\nsoftware. Overall, 141 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between pancreatic tumor and normal specimens. Further GO and pathway annotation analysis revealed that miR-106, miR-1287 and miR-100 play roles in 8 common functions, including regulating neuron apoptotic signaling, nervous system disorders, and negative regulation of neurogenesis.

Comparison with metoclopramide given intravenously.\nFollowing operations in 30 patients, serum naloxone and met-enkephalin were determined, before and after the operation, by radioimmunoassay. Nausea and/or vomiting occurred in 6 patients, and the same number passed their urine during the night, the former condition being significantly associated with low urine volumes. Naloxone infused intravenously did not reduce these conditions significantly, although serum met-enkephalin levels were maintained, and serum cortisol showed a trend to increase. The infusion of met-enkephalin produced no significant effect. Intravenous metoclopramide, an antidopaminergic drug, was given during the first night and resulted in a significant reduction of the nausea and vomiting scores. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that post-operative nausea and vomiting are due to a depletion of endogenous serum met-enkephalin and/or the activation of pathways inhibiting food intake. These conditions can be reversed by drugs, of which metoclopramide is clinically superior, and met-enkephalin can be used as a prophylactic.<EOD> .\nUsing the method of isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), 18 trace elements were determined in human blood plasma, hair, and urine by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

Furthermore, the treatment of SCZ usually includes the use of antipsychotics, which may cause cognitive decline and negative side effects for the patient. There are indications that the occurrence of cognitive decline may be partly independent of the clinical course, such as treatment resistance. In this context, cognitive decline may be more clearly associated with differences in antipsychotic treatment than with symptomatology or disease biology. Cognitive decline may be influenced by different clinical factors, including symptom severity, but also by patient and disease factors, such as genetic predisposition or comorbidities. However, there is still a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present paper reviews the association between different parameters and the occurrence of cognitive decline in SCZ. It considers different factors, such as the specific antipsychotic itself, the clinical severity of positive symptoms, the level of negative symptoms, and other comorbidities.<EOD> Effect of long-term administration of estrogen receptor agonists on intestinal adenoma in Apc +/min 850,",

During electrical stimulation, the LV contracts isometrically at frequencies ranging from 2.0 to 2.8 Hz. The amplitude of the isovolumic systolic contraction is greater at lower frequencies and gradually diminishes as the heart rate increases. At heart rates above 2.6 Hz, most of the change in the amplitude of the isovolumic contraction occurs early in contraction. In animals in which the heart is allowed to continue to beat spontaneously following 10 to 15 minutes of electrical stimulation, the amplitude of the isovolumic contraction is depressed only slightly at heart rates from 2.6 to 3.4 Hz. The diastolic time curve, which is obtained by plotting LV pressure during diastole as a function of time from the beginning of systole, is highly reproducible in individual hearts. With increasing heart rate, the time to reach peak pressure during diastole is longer and the duration of the rapid component of filling is longer than that for slower heart rates. In control isovolumically contracting hearts the diastolic time curve exhibits a short ascending limb, a long plateau, and a short descending limb. Increasing pericardial pressure depressed LV pressure during diastole at all heart rates. The magnitude of the depression is proportional to the amplitude of the systolic contraction and inversely related to LV volume. During isovolumic contraction at heart rates of 2.6 and 2.8 Hz",

Here, we report that AAV\u2010mediated overexpression of PTH, which was initiated 6 wk after the start of ovariectomy, for an 8\u2010wk period resulted in greater increases in bone strength measurements, despite equivalent changes in bone mass. Biomechanical measurements revealed increases in yield, ultimate force, strain, displacement, stiffness, energy absorption, work to failure, load at yield, and displacement at yield in the AAV\u2010mediated PTH group. Conversely, bacterial tracer uptake measurements demonstrated significantly more tracer in the trabecular bone compartment in the AAV\u2010mediated PTH group.

A recent study on the race/ethnicity of medical students reported that there was an apparent increase in racial minorities from 1978 (14%) to 2014, but this was the result of increases in minorities other than African-Americans [bib_ref]  A nationwide census of underrepresented minority faculty at medical schools, Jackson [/bib_ref] . The study also demonstrated a disparate representation of Black medical students compared to other racial minorities [bib_ref]  A nationwide census of underrepresented minority faculty at medical schools, Jackson [/bib_ref] . In 2007, the Institute of Medicine published the report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care. The report noted that there are racial and ethnic disparities in health status and healthcare as a result of systemic differences in the delivery of healthcare [bib_ref]  Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care, Nelson [/bib_ref] . The report also noted that these disparities can partly be attributed to the lack of diversity in medicine [bib_ref]  Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care, Nelson [/bib_ref] . A common theme in most of these reports is that the need for increased minority representation in medicine exists.\nThe goal of this study was to examine medical school admissions committees and their use and need for evaluation feedback to determine student admissions. One objective of the study was to evaluate if there is sufficient diversity among committee members to accurately assess the admissions interview. Previous studies have demonstrated that diversity is underutilized within medicine [bib_ref]  Medical education in the United States and Canada: perspectives from diversity, Tekian [/bib_ref] . Since admissions committees are charged with the responsibility for identifying the most competitive applicants for medical school they play a major role in selecting health",

We have proposed that thecal cell androgen production is initiated by FSH through a high-affinity FSH receptor. Recently we have shown that this high-affinity receptor is not expressed in other tissues that may be involved in the androgen production cascade, such as adrenal cortex and testicles. We have reported previously that we have generated a transgenic mouse harboring an antisense construct specific for the mouse ovarian FSH receptor. The mice expressing this transgene have a diminished number of thecal cells and a reduced level of ovarian androgen production. In light of these findings, the present study was designed to determine if the reproductive capacity of mice, in which the FSH receptor has been inactivated selectively in the ovarian thecal cell, has been compromised. To this end, mice heterozygous for either an X-linked testicular (Tfm/Y) factor or a conditional ovarian FSH receptor were mated, and their progeny were bred to confirm the inheritance of the Tfm/Y factor and the ovarian FSH receptor defect. Pregnant female mice heterozygous for both the X-linked Tfm/Y factor and the FSH receptor defect were hysterectomized and the remainder of their genital tracts were removed. Ovarian function was studied in vitro, and androgen production was determined by RIA of ovarian tissue supernatant. Pregnant controls with intact ovaries were used for comparison of data.

We investigated the influence of PP without abdominal surgery on diaphragmatic contractility and mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients. Design:A prospective, observational clinical study. Settings:A multidisciplinary intensive care unit located in a university hospital. Patients:Mechanically ventilated adult patients with severe respiratory disorders. Interventions:Diaphragmatic electromyogram, esophagus manometry, pulmonary mechanics, and transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements were performed in patients during PP and after decompression. Measurements and Main Results:We studied seven patients, four men and three women (one patient discharged and then readmitted twice, twice before and once after surgery), with a mean (sd) age of 64 (16) yrs and a mean (sd) duration of mechanical ventilation of 14.7 (8) days. Mean (sd) body mass index was 22.1 (2.3) kg/m2, and mean (sd) peak inspiratory pressure was 33.5 (6.33) cm H2O. Patients had various underlying diseases, including pneumonia and neurologic injury. During PP, transdiaphragmatic pressure was significantly decreased (\u22128.97 vs. \u221214.96 cm H2O), as it was the pressure-generating capacity (124.50 vs. 156.35 mm Hg\u00b7cm\u20143).

If only observations are made on the cumulative number of mating trips, the distribution of time to the first copula may be calculated but not the distribution of time to the last copula. Data were obtained which allowed determinations of distributions of time to both first copula and last copula, the percentage of females mated (monoand polyandrous) and the percentage of females not mated. Some females were observed to have completed both copulative trips at the same time, some to have completed the first copulative trip prior to the last copulative trip. The distributions of the duration of any copulation trial followed a lognormal distribution and were, in general, similar for any copulatory trial. The distributions of the durations of first and last copulatory trials were similar. Results are also given on the time to copulation during the first 9-hrs as compared to the next three consecutive 9-hrs and the last 10-hrs of the 27-hr day.

Additionally, the age of first disclosure of some form of abuse to a health practitioner and whether practitioners were perceived to provide support are investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis paper uses a national probability sample of Australians 18 years of age and older with different forms of relationship status, who report being in a same sex relationship at some stage of their life. Data was collected across a number of questions regarding same sex relationship history, abuse from a parent from childhood and sexual and physical abuse from the current or ex-partner, as well as sociodemographic information. Multivariate analyses were used to examine the patterns of any abuse and abuse from the current or ex-partner, and the age of first disclosure and its relationship with the practitioner.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 72 per cent of participants reported a history of abuse, 31 per cent from their partner, 9 per cent from a parent and 23 per cent from childhood abuse (physical, emotional, sexual and physical only), and 60 per cent reported abuse in one or more forms. Only a quarter of people experiencing abuse from the current or ex-partner or from childhood disclosed to a doctor, nurse, counsellor or psychologist, and just over half (51 per cent) disclosed to their ex-partner.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study shows a high prevalence of physical, emotional and sexual abuse from the current or expartner among this group of people who are in same-sex relationships and who grew up in Australia. The majority of people experiencing these forms of abuse had not disclosed it to a health practitioner.<EOD> .\nThe frequency of bone marrow failure in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is relatively high.

All the patients who had inoperable, incurable, unresectable advanced gastrointestinal cancer, and who received gemcitabine from February 1987 to December 1991, entered the study. Patient characteristics were age (median: 54 years), sex (7 men, 4 women), primary site (gastric: 17, duodenal: 1, colorectal: 3, periampullary: 1), prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy (all 9 patients), median WBC 3146/microl, ANC 2170/microl, platelet 159,000/microl, serum total bilirubin 2.36 mg/dl. Four patients received a combination therapy with cisplatin, 1 with 5-FU, and 4 with mitomycin. The median number of administrations per patient was 2 times and it ranged from 1 to 9 times. Side effects were as follows: leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (Grade II or III was found in 8 and 7 patients, respectively, out of the 35 cycles), nausea and vomiting (Grade II in 3 patients, Grade III in 1). These symptoms were controlled easily. We thought that gemcitabine seems to be of promise in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal cancer.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n(1) Side effects of gemcitabine were generally mild and easily controllable.

The present study was undertaken to determine if captopril inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivo, i.e., during coronary stent implantation and mechanical and balloon angioplasty. A group of 20 patients (median age 59 years; range 45-75) with 22 lesions (anginal classification; 11 single vessel, 8 multivessel and 3 cases could not be evaluated) and a history of previous myocardial infarction, but without heart failure, were included into this study. The patients were submitted to thrombus formation in the left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery and right coronary artery, in random order. After a control injection of heparin (3 mg), all patients received 10 mcg/kg/min of captopril, and 1-3 hours thrombus formation was recorded. Coronary artery thrombosis occurred in 13 out of 71 vessel segments. After captopril, only 1 case (2.48%) was positive for thrombus formation. The difference was significant (p < 0.01). The effect of captopril seems to be due to an inhibition of thrombus formation, while the platelet aggregation seemed to be not affected.<EOD> .\n\n This article is a study of migration of the population of Romania during the period between",

These therapies have been mainly focused on targeting cancer cells and their microenvironment, enabling precise patient-tailored therapeutics.

In the second series, 100 muCi of 3H-thymidine was transferred into the amnion with the embryos of CBA females mated with CBA male. In the third series, 100 muCi of thymidine was injected directly into the uterine lumen. In the fourth series, the radioactive solution (100 muCi/ embryo) was injected directly into the uterine lumen during embryo transfer between 1.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. (during the second half of the light cycle). At 30 minutes after treatment, or in the case of embryo transfer, at 50 minutes, the animals were killed and the embryos removed. Autoradiographs after exposure of the slides to X-rays, made it possible to study the grain concentrations over trophoblast and whole blastocyst.

For this, you need to learn how to construct patient attributes and fill in the patient notes. Here are some sample data for patient [INST] Hello. You are a nurse in an oncology clinic. Your task is to enter your diagnoses and symptoms of a cancer patient into the medical record system after conducting a physical exam. The symptoms or diagnoses recorded in the information system are the patient's attributes. Let's think step by step. \nFirst, make a list of patient attributes. What information would be useful to know about a patient in order to enter a cancer diagnosis or symptom into a medical record? Include only information necessary for the patient attribute \"diagnosis\" or \"symptom\" to appear on the patient's record. We have collected a list of cancer diagnoses and symptoms from various sources, including a public clinical terminology system, and the diagnoses and symptoms that appear in the hospital-specific patient information system. \nSome patients have multiple cancer diagnoses, so you need a way to refer back to the full list of all diagnoses. If you need multiple terms to describe a diagnosis, you can assign different terms to the same attribute value. [INST] Hello. You are a student in a nursing course, and your project team is developing a web-based patient information system database for patient record information.

The size of pores, however, has not been standardized and used as a control factor in the study of intracellular transfection in microfluidic systems. Here, we studied the microfluidic devices fabricated with polystyrene/dioxane copolymer and the delivery of plasmid DNA to cells by varying pore size. By using atomic force microscopy and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching, we could easily measure the intracellular movement or extraction efficiency of the plasmid DNA and compare it with the size and number of pores made by microfluidic compression. The delivery efficiency showed a correlation with the pore size and the number of pores fabricated in the polystyrene layer. This suggests that pore size is indeed a control factor for intracellular transfection efficiency.<EOD> The first case of primary small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder in a patient on chronic hemodialysis.\nPrimary small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SCCUB) is a rare form of bladder neoplasm with incidence of < 1% in all bladder tumors. Patients with SCCUB are usually poor surgical candidates, which is not surprising since the disease is usually advanced at the time of presentation and its prognosis is dismal. A 78-year-old man on chronic hemodialysis was transferred to our hospital because of the appearance of gross hematuria. Retrograde cystoscopy revealed an irregular mass of the urinary bladder. Computed tomography (CT) showed no evidence of metastasis to regional lymph nodes or distant organs. The tumor was diagnosed as SCCUB on the basis of the result of urinary cytology and a biopsy specimen of the tumor. No evidence of systemic metastasis was present on CT. He was staged with a pT2 pN0 tumor and treated by transurethral resection.",

The cytotoxic approach is based on the principle of killing the malignant cell by damage to essential cellular macromolecules, e.g. DNA. Cytostatic activity is dependent on inhibition of cell multiplication, possibly through disruption of spindle microtubules. The cytocidal mode, unlike the other two, relies on direct cellular death from damage to functionally essential cytoplasmic molecules.

Endotoxin had a stimulating effect on the proliferating capacity of these cells during regeneration and differentiation of injured skeletal muscle, while the rate of this process was markedly reduced in animals injected with phosphate-buffered saline. Endotoxin also stimulated the proliferation of cardiotoxin-injured myoblasts in vitro.

In glucose-deprived islets incubated in the absence of ATP, glucose induced an initial rise in i and an ensuing depolarization. Subsequently, the glucose-induced depolarization, insulin release, and i increased rapidly. In the presence of ATP the response of islet membrane potential and i to glucose was biphasic. An initial fall in membrane potential and i was followed by a rapid, transient rise in i. The transient rise in i was dependent on adenosine triphosphate, but was not seen in the presence of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. These results suggest that the initial depolarization and rise in i induced by glucose were caused by activation of ATP-sensitive K channels and that the subsequent response in the presence of ATP depended on a rise in i by Ca influx through glucose-induced voltage-dependent Ca channels.\nAlthough much experimental data are available concerning the mechanisms and control of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, as well as the factors that affect the biosynthesis of this hormone, the precise role of the Ca 2+ concentration in these processes has not been clarified.\nStudies in isolated beta cells have demonstrated that insulin secretion is exquisitely dependent upon a rise in the cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration (i). Studies of the pancreatic islet suggest that the rise in i is mediated primarily, if not exclusively, by Ca influx, since the action of glucose is completely blocked by thapsigargin. The influx ofCa 2+ into beta cells causes depolarization, activating voltage-dependent Ca",

Man-5-P is cleaved intracellularly to free monomeric oligosaccharide and the phosphomonoester Man-6-P. Man-6-P interacts specifically with proteins of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) family. Through the high-affinity binding of Man-6-P, these receptors target a large number of lysosomal enzymes to their intracellular destination and, in the case of the cation-dependent MPRs, traffic other proteins to the endosomal compartment. While the functional activities of the MPRs have been well characterized, the molecular recognition between MPRs and their ligands, free Man-6-P, has not been elucidated on an atomic level. We employed a structure-based approach in an effort to understand how the MPRs bind to Man-6-P. We constructed a model of Man-6-P bound to a portion of the receptor that binds Man-6-P (MPER), and we evaluated this complex by molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the two monomeric oligosaccharide chains are positioned in approximately opposite orientations with respect to the MPER. In addition, the two monosaccharide GlcNAs project into two different channels of the MPER, and, consequently, the two chains are unlikely to interact simultaneously with any single residue of the MPR. To test the predicted structural asymmetry experimentally, we used a chemiluminescent assay of Man-6-P binding to a portion of the human cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR). We found that Man-6-P binds significantly more strongly to one face of the CD-MPR compared to the other.",

Methods This study was a prospective open-label randomized controlled evaluation. It was composed of two clinical trials. The clinical trial compared the high-dose gatifloxacin with the low-dose doxycycline treatment arm over six months. The radiological trial compared the effect of the two treatments on spermatic cord granuloma regression (at a period of three months). The two arms of this non-inferiority trial included 29 participants (56 oral sexual contact partners at risk of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis) and were allocated in randomized ratios of 1:1 for the clinical trial or 2:2 for the radiological trial. The primary efficacy outcome was the clinical efficacy at six months after the start of treatment (microbiological eradication). Microbiological confirmation of Chlamydia trachomatis infection or clinical persistence was the secondary efficacy outcome. Clinical persistence was also the primary endpoint for the radiological outcome. Results The clinical treatment efficacy at the primary endpoint of the six months was not inferior for gatifloxacin, as it was found to be non-inferior.

Empathy predicts helping behavior and positive outcomes and is the result of both general and interpersonal processes. Recognizing a need is not enough, but the presence of empathy is associated with more positive interpersonal responses. Empathy is also related to prosocial behavior, which includes behavior to help others in need, and this is true whether one shares their identity in common or not. In clinical medicine, in addition to patient centeredness there are four components: patient perspective taking, taking the perspective of the family and social network, and taking the perspective of clinical colleagues.\n\nThe definition of empathy is based on the theoretical basis of the psychological, social, neural, hormonal, and evolutionary processes involved in the experience and expression of empathy.

We have recently demonstrated that photoacoustic (PA) imaging using short laser pulses can overcome this limitation to image gold nanostructures located several millimeters deep into tissue. We have also shown that ultrashort pulsed laser induced fluorescence (UPILF), generated by ultraintense, ultrashort laser pulses, can resolve fluorescence from the nanostructures deep in tissue. In this work, we investigate whether PA signal and UPILF signal can be simultaneously used to image the 3D distribution of gold nanostructures in biological tissue deep into the tissue. The PA/UPILF imaging system consisted of a single, picosecond, ultrafast pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (100 fs, 80 MHz, 760 nm), a custom-made optical fibre bundle-based PA imaging system, and an optical set-up for UPILF.

Factors influencing the need for hospital readmission are unknown.<EOD> Nitric Oxide-Inhibited Nucleic Acid Phosphodiesterase in Murine Macrophages*\n\nProstacyclin-mediated suppression of lymphocyte proliferation is dependent on the generation of nitric oxide and the ability of the latter to inhibit DNA endonuclease activity. In this study, we have found that nitric oxide treatment abrogates the phosphodiesterase activity of the nucleic acid enzyme present in murine peritoneal macrophages, a response paralleled by the inhibition of myeloperoxidase. Nitric oxide is rapidly synthesized at high levels by macrophages exposed to agonist stimulation, and the generation of nitrite reaches a peak of over 8 mM. This results in the inactivation of the enzyme, the loss of which is proportional to the generation of nitrite. This is in contrast to the presence of an unresponsive cytosolic phosphodiesterase found in resting macrophages.The inhibition of this enzyme activity represents a potentially important control for the regulation of prostaglandin E 1 metabolism.\nThe major products excreted in the urinary fluids of humans and animals are the urotoxins hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. These metabolites also have been shown to be formed from exogenously supplied purines such as adenineand adenosine. In the case of adenosine, phosphohydrolysis at the level of the nucleoside leads to the formation of the metabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine, and inorganic phosphate. The mechanism of these reactions involves the hydrolysis of the phosphoric ester linkage in the adenine ring to yield nucleoside monophosphate, which is subsequently phosphorolyzed to yield a nucleoside and inorganic ph",

Findings in 1955 blood donors from northern finland.\nTo elucidate the effect of age and gender on serum creatine kinase (CK)-activity in blood donors, the activity of CK was determined in sera from 1955 regular blood donors (836 women, 1119 men), aged years. The distribution of serum CK-activity was bimodal, with a dominant peak at 120-160 IU/l for women and at 150-230 IU/l for men. The second peak was somewhat lower in women (60-80 IU/l) compared to men (60-110 IU/l) in the 40s decade, but the pattern of both bimodal distribution was very similar in both genders. No age difference in serum CK-activity could be detected in women, whereas a slight increase towards the age of 50 was found in men in the age group 30-39 (p < 0.05) and in the age group 40-49 (p < 0.01).

Abstract: The present study was designed to determine whether the A1 (A1RA; CB-19222) or the A4 (A4RA; AP311015) receptor agonists will diminish the renal pressor responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) and whether these agonists may reduce the increased pressor responses of the 2 kidney, I-clip Goldblatt hypertensive (GH) rat. The renal pressor responses of male GH Sprague-Dawley rats in the presence of CB-192222 (0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) or AP311015 (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) or vehicle were determined in the presence and absence of AT2 antagonism (PD123319; 50 \u03bcg/kg i.v.). The pressor responses of the GH group to angiotensin II after pretreatment with A1 or A4 agonists or vehicle were compared at 15 min. The dose-response curves for the kidney (renal perfusion pressure) pressor responses to intragenicular angiotensin II were right shifted following administration of A1 receptor agonist. The pressor responses to intravenous angiotensin I1 were also increased after A1 receptor agonist.

Immobilized HIV-1 Tat bound efficiently to the AU-rich target sequence, CCAGACAUCAACAGGCAACCCAACACACAG 3\u2032 UUUAGAGCGCCGGGG 5\u2032 (target: 3\u2032-CAU-5\u2032), but it bound weakly to UACAUCAACAGGCAAC mRNA with three modified bases (UAU). Injection of the peptide into living cells indicated that translocation of immobilized Tat across the plasma membrane is highly efficient. The effect of mutation of three bases (CCCA \u2192 CCC) at the 5\u2032-end of the target mRNA on Tat binding was examined. The mutant bound poorly to the immobilized HIV-1 Tat and was not transported into live cells. Furthermore, competition analysis with the double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide, 3\u2032-TGCAATAGCC-5\u2032, indicated that two target and two complementary bases could bind Tat. The binding sites were investigated using the fluorescent dye, rhodamine 110-labeled oligonucleotide (RH-110) or N-methylisatoic acid-RH-110 (1). The results indicated that the target mRNA bound immobilized Tat mainly as a double-stranded structure, which was also verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The AU-rich sequence AU-rich in its 3\u2032, ACAUC 5\u2032 was observed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy.

To evaluate the role of AVP in the pathogenesis of hypertension in pheochromocytoma, we examined plasma free AVP in patients with spontaneous and pharmacologically provoked hypertension and in patients with normal plasma free norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) during a pheochromocytoma-specific stimulus. Seven of 21 patients with pheochromocytoma were studied: three had spontaneous hypertension (one with malignant pheochromocytoma), two had hypertension only after stimulation, and two had normotension throughout the observations. Controls were 6 normotensive patients with normal plasma free NE and E but high plasma free AVP, as a result of dehydration, and 14 healthy normotensive and 8 hypertensive subjects. Plasma free AVP in patients with spontaneous or stimulated hypertension was significantly higher than that of the controls with normal plasma free NE and E (2.53 +/- 0.83 pg/ml, 2.54 +/- 0.84 pg/ml versus 0.05 +/- 0.02 Pg/ml, P less than 0.01).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective studies, and retrospective studies related to the relationship between NETs, the inflammasome, and AP's onset, development, or outcome were included and analyzed. A total of 185 original studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 23 articles were included in the quantitative analysis.Results: The qualitative analysis showed that NETs can promote the inflammatory response and induce the inflammatory response via the inflammasome in experimental and clinical AP. The levels of NETs and the inflammasome were closely related to the clinical severity of AP and AP animal models.Conclusion: NETs and inflammasome are closely related to the prognosis of the disease. Thus, the inflammasome is not only a downstream target for the management of NETs but also provides a new target for AP. The mechanisms and pathological effects of NETosis in pancreatitis require further in-depth examination.\n\n# Introduction\nNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), an important strategy in neutrophil killing of target pathogens (1), are formed by the extrusion of polymeric filamentous DNA, histones, and protein complexes derived from neutrophils.

In his first feature, 1996's \"Papa lebe\" (1996), Kl\u00f6ffel collaborated with well known screenwriter Walter Netzel, as well as writer/actor Alexander Puskeppen and composer Rainer Kussmaul.\nHe has recently shot \"Mozart\" alongside acclaimed actress Giselle Krawecki. This is a highly anticipated project produced by his own company KELLERBERG FILMS, founded by himself and by the producer Stefan Nielsen. They started this in Berlin in 2005.\nKl\u00f6ffel's most renowned work to now, are his theatre productions. He has staged the play \"Hexen\", the first German play ever performed by a blind actor in 2002. Since 1990",

Patients and methods Systolic and diastolic left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiographic measurements in 20 previously normotensive patients with sustained systemic hypertension. Nine patients exhibited left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), and 11 patients exhibited normal left ventricular function (NLV). ANP and BNP were measured in all patients at baseline and after 12 months of perindopril treatment (which resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure). Results The LVDD group (mean age 47.8 \u00b1 8.1 years; 4 men/5 women) significantly reduced their age-adjusted blood pressure (BA) from 182.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg to 143.2 \u00b1 2.9 mmHg and also in 12 months (P  BNP  103 pmol/l] and four patients  were in the NLV group.

He was diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia because of microcytic anemia; however, his transferrin saturation (TS) level was within normal range.

Here, we propose a possible mechanism for this phenomenon in relation to NO3-. This mechanism would explain why rice paddies produce less N2O than N. Our results demonstrate that rice paddies with low NO3- and high SO42- concentrations produce less N2O from biota than rice paddies with high NO3- concentrations. Moreover, N2 emissions in both the rice and rice residue seasons from rice paddies with high NO3- concentrations were correlated with NO3- concentrations. These results suggest that the N2O produced from heterotrophic nitrification in rice paddies in the early vegetative season is consumed in further reactions to be stored in soils. The N2O produced in rice paddies with high SO42- concentrations would also be destroyed by N2O denitrification and would never have been detected by the chamber measurement. These findings suggest that NOX, especially N2O, might be produced at different places in the soil.<EOD> .\nThis study was a research report that explored the experience of mothers who have dealt with the difficulties of raising a child with",

We used a unilateral renal cross circulation system to investigate how renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate affects the flow to the intracranial segment of the carotid artery and to brain cortical microvessels in rats. Regional blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter and an ultramicroprobe flowmeter, respectively. A single 24-h exposure to uranyl nitrate (8 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced renal clearance of creatinine (60.1 +/- 9.1%), and caused acute renal failure, as evidenced by a 14-fold increase in plasma creatinine and a large increase in the urea-nitrogen and creatinine clearance. Arterial blood pressure also decreased. This renal failure, however, did not result either in any significant decrease in the intracranial segment of the common carotid artery flow after uranyl nitrate treatment or in the cortical microcirculation. The results therefore fail to support the hypothesis that this chemical could affect brain circulation by renal vascular toxicity, although this study would need another experimental approach in order to exclude other possibilities.<EOD> .\nProstanoids play important roles as inflammatory mediators and vasoactive factors.

Diagnosing AKI is difficult, as creatinine does not change early and acute changes in urinary output are usually nonspecific. In critically ill population, serum creatinine does not change quickly enough to represent a useful marker of true tubular injury in the ICU. In addition, the changes in the blood creatinine concentration in AKI are relatively modest, usually less than onefold increase from baseline. The use of biomarkers could be a more precise method to assess renal damage in the ICU patients with acute renal failure. Interleukin\u201018 (IL\u201018) is an important inflammatory mediator, produced principally by activated macrophages. Previously, its role in renal cells and animal models of kidney damage is described. Human studies are scarce and limited, as few studies reported the levels of IL\u201018 in renal diseases and its possible implications for the evaluation and prediction of renal disease progression in CKD and AKI. In addition, there are no studies regarding the levels of IL\u201018 in the serum of critically ill patients in ICU. In this review, we focus on the role of this cytokine IL\u201018 as a potential biomarker of renal injury.<EOD> Neuropsychological assessment in clinical practice.\nNeuropsychological assessment has been increasingly referred to as part of the overall rehabilitation process, as well as in providing important clinical information about patients with central nervous system disease.

The clinical success of EDDG in treating complex full-thickness wounds resulted in its use with increasing frequency. This led to questions about the mechanism by which dermal fibroblasts were preventing hyperproliferation of the basal layer keratinocytes, a process which occurs in the EDDG. This study addresses this paradox and investigates the biological mechanism by which grafted or implanted dermal fibroblasts regulate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of keratinocytes during the wound healing process. To accomplish these goals, a coculture system with grafted fibroblasts and prefabricated dermis and a tetrazolium salt (N-Acetyl 3,7-dimethyl-PBG (MTS))-based cell growth assay were developed. The results were analyzed by the Student t test and linear regression models using JMP software from SAS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed the EDDG promoted keratinocyte hyperproliferation and migration in the coculture compared with other dermal constructs. In an indirect co-culture model, the EDDG demonstrated a 2-fold inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the EDDG consistently exhibited more than a 2-fold inhibition of keratinocyte migration compared with control. This demonstrates the ability of grafted fibroblasts to inhibit migration and control the hyperproliferative response",

Results: Four habitat types were identified and linked to observed nest-site selection: forest specialized, forest edge specialized, grassland specialized, and generalists. In forest specialized nesters, the importance of a specific class, habitat specialization, is explained by the probability of finding suitable host trees in forest specialized nest sites. In forest edge specialized nesters, the importance of a specific class, habitat specialization, is explained by two reasons: (i) the distance to the nearest tree, in which trees of other classes are nested, increases; (ii) the number of forest trees increases and the vegetation is less dense. In generalist nesters, we found no habitat specialization for this group. Conclusion: The habitat type, and forest specialized versus forest edge specialized, has a strong influence on nest-site selection.\n\n# Background\nMany birds build a nest during their breeding period and may suffer different nest predation risk [bib_ref]  Ecology of nest predation by vertebrates, Martin [/bib_ref] .

To our knowledge, the relationship between the echographic measurements during the first trimester and the fetal\u2013neonatal outcomes in diabetic pregnancies has not been confirmed. Aim: This study aimed to analyse the predictive power of embryo echographic measurements on neonatal outcomes in diabetic pregnant women at term. Subjects and methods: A retrospective analysis of all pregnant diabetic women who entered in a public centre for diabetic pregnant women from 2001 to 2012 was undertaken. All data from ultrasound examinations were collected at week 7 before delivery. A comparison of the echographic results was performed with the fetal\u2013neonatal outcomes obtained at delivery. Multivariate analysis for associations with clinical and ultrasound parameters associated with fetal outcome was performed. Results: 135 pregnant diabetic and 127 non-diabetic women were tested. The results showed no relationship between abnormal echographic measurements in pre-gestational diabetic pregnant women and neonatal outcomes, with the exception of the correlation with hypotrophy at birth, which is defined as a birth weight\u2009<\u20095th percentile for gestational age and with the absence of neonatal hypotrophy that we observed in the diabetic pregnant population. Conclusions: Our results showed a correlation between the lack of fetal hypotrophy in diabetic pregnant women and the absence of neonatal hypotrophy and a correlation between hypotrophy at birth and the absence of normal embryo measurement in the diabetic pregnant women. Our observations may highlight new aspects of the diabetic embryopathy.<EOD> SARS-CoV-2-Induced Lysosomal Depletion Impairs VSV-CoV-2 Entry",

This EMR should have both general and specialized functions for clinical and pre-clinical research and be accessible to both experienced and inexperienced users, without training them on complex and inefficient tasks. \n**Summary:**\nWith current EMR systems and tools, clinical and pre-clinical research require excessive and inefficient tasks to support user needs. As a result, not only they hinder efficient use of information, but also impede important communication among researchers. To optimize the interaction with patients and with fellow researchers, we need a more general and efficient EMR system with a human-centered design. \n\n### Context\nThe University of Southern California (USC) is a multi-campus university with three main campuses that offer a wide range of health services. The Keck Medical Center of USC provides a large range of sophisticated clinical services with the support of cutting-edge, high-quality information technology (IT) solutions. For years, USC has been improving various IT systems to provide the best and most efficient care for patients. \nUSC's IT systems are facing a significant challenge when it comes to the EMR system. Current IT systems cannot efficiently support the high volume and variety of clinical and pre-clinical research. Therefore, multiple researchers who conduct preclinical studies use heterogeneous tools, and the resulting data are stored in discontinuous systems, making their use and visualizations cumbersome.  \nTo tackle this challenge, USC aims to create a new EMR system that can support clinical and pre-clinical research of various specialties, from inception to trial completion. The system should fulfill a high range of clinical-research related tasks, such as patient's identification, scheduling, reporting, clinical trial management, experimental design, and analytics for clinical and pre-clinical tasks. \nThe new EMR is based on recent advances in data-visualization technologies, allowing intuitive and efficient exploration and analysis of complex biomedical and clinical data, with a better understanding of the underlying phenomena and clinical implications.

Byers, M.D., personal communication). These investigators, using short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction loci, have also documented a 2.6-Mbp deletion within this region that removes the gene for tenascin (TNC). Because this deletion is thought to be a common variant in people without the EDS, and because the gene for tenascin is expressed widely, in a variety of tissues and developmental stages (i.e., mesoderm-derived structures",

Methotrexate (MTX) or aminopterin is a folic acid antagonist widely used in the treatment of cancer. When given continuously at low doses, the dose-limiting toxic effect is myelosuppression. Higher dose schedules used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (e.g. 10 mg/sq m/2 days for 5 days every 4 weeks), and the use of MTX for pulse chemotherapy at higher doses, e.g. 100 mg/m2/24 hr or even greater, have shown that significant, sometimes severe, toxicity to other organs can also occur. A survey by Smith and colleagues, on 261 cases treated with MTX over a 30 year period, showed acute toxicity, especially of the central nervous system, occurring in 53 cases (21 %): Mucositis in 44 cases (17 %), pulmonary toxicity in 15 (6 %), gastrointestinal toxicity in 12 (4 %), ocular toxicity in 3 (1 %) and myocardial toxicity in one case.<EOD> Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of patients with chronic headaches and medication-overuse headache: the Italian CEREBEL study\n\n\n\n# Introduction\nOn 30 January 2020, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in Italy.

Although this phenomenon was already described in the livers, lungs, cardiovascular system, skin and nervous system, many HA molecular interactions and functions outside the liver and lungs remain to be fully elucidated. HA receptors are expressed in all neurodevelopmental stages in both humans and mice. Our most recent in vitro studies have shown that HA and CD44 interactions are necessary for the induction of a migratory phenotype, cell migration and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in human neural stem cells (NSCs), indicating that HA-CD44 signaling exerts neurotypical functions.

In this course, I will show you the use of the 12 factors which are the inclusion criteria for clinical trials. Today, I'm going to tell you about factor 1, which is gender. [SOLN] Before we move on to the next factor, let's repeat what we already covered in our first lesson. The inclusion guidelines of factor 4 are `Gender; must be female or male.`, and if the patient age is within the factor 7, `Age (years); 50 or above.`, both of them are true. We know that the patient must be female and aged 50 or above, so we can move on to the next lesson.\n[END]\n[SOLN] The first factor, gender, refers to the sex of the patient. The eligibility of gender is usually not explicitly required for randomized trials, and many trials use a gender-neutral approach. However, we can add information about 'sex (man or woman)' for some diseases. For example, the eligibility factor of factor 2 is `Gender (men or women); only women.`. There are some diseases such as endometriosis, which is a disorder affecting women. Therefore, the gender information must be extracted to determine whether a person is a man or a woman. Therefore, if 'sex (man or woman)' factor 2 is not satisfied, we must remove this case from the research. In this example, the clinical trial guidelines will require 'gender (women)'. If a person is female rather than male, they will be removed.\n[END]\n[SESS] There is a patient whose age is not in the factor 7. This also leads to the removal of the case when a clinical trial has an inclusion criteria on age, for example, 'age (50 or above)'; see the exclusion criteria in factor 10 of [INST] Figure .\nHowever, we can also examine whether the patient meets the exclusion criteria in the clinical trial. In this case, the patient's age satisfies the inclusion age. In the same way, when you want to move on to the next lesson on sex or age, you must check if their values are satisfied.\nFin",

        "output": "1) What is the value of Assessment of Eligibility?\n\t1) Assessment of Eligibility: This is a specialized term in clinical research. The importance of the assessment of eligibility lies in its ability to screen a patient for clinical trials based on the patient's disease and its status. Eligibility criteria may include a requirement for the patient to be currently taking a specific drug or to be in specific age group.\nAssessing eligibility is a screening procedure to determine which patients fit the criteria to participate in a research study.\nMedical record review is defined as the process of compiling data from medical records into a usable form, typically for inclusion in a database.Medical practitioners in clinical trials commonly perform medical record review, where each record is reviewed to assess its eligibility for the particular study. This is usually done by research staff or by medical experts in the field. Research staff often compile the data into a database or spreadsheet for statistical analysis.\nA medical record is a formal record of patient visits to a medical doctor or other health care provider for the purpose of monitoring the patient's health and managing their treatment.\nRecords are important to track the progress of the patient and the treatment that they have had. By recording various details of a patient, doctors can provide an accurate account of the patient's medical history. This is done to help doctors decide on possible treatments or medications that may help with any physical or mental disorders that are affecting the patient.\nPatient and disease characteristics affect the effectiveness of different drugs. When comparing 2 similar drugs, a drug can be more effective in patients with a specific age, gender, racial groups, or a specific disease state. \nHere is an example of patient history, including diagnosis, age, and disease severity, to assess efficacy and adverse events:\nAges of participants in this trial were very small since 80% females were aged 15-35.

Just as the same data that was used to learn the concepts were applied to develop the knowledge-based information system for decision support, the same types of cases should be used to test newly developed KBs. \n\nTo implement a KBC for eligibility assessment, let`s take a look at the case below as an example. \nThis is a case that demonstrates how two factors affect eligibility assessment: gender and age. In a clinical trial that is conducting research at a military base, eligibility assessment is based upon military personnel records. The clinical trial team is trying to target the soldiers in each branch (Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard) for participant recruitment in a trial about a new anti-ulcer medication. \nThis table lists demographic and military information of several different types of military personnel. As shown in this table, the eligibility of individuals from the Army and Coast Guard branches varies; a male subject with age between 26 and 34 is a potential participant. On the other hand, as shown in this table, personnel in the Air Force and Navy are not eligible. This is because there are no male soldiers under 35 years of age in Air Force and no female soldiers of any age in the Navy. Hence, we can conclude that the target of clinical trial should include male soldiers in the Army and Coast Guard branches between 26 and 34 years of age. \nHere is another case that illustrates inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this case, the person's gender is specified, which is not a factor in the previous table. \nThis case shows that a 73 year-old man with a blood pressure of 143 over 82 mm Hg is eligible. Also, a 49-year-old woman with lung cancer in stage IV is ineligible for this trial because she has stage IV lung cancer.

Regional anesthesia has many benefits. It provides excellent intraoperative anesthesia and muscle relaxation as well as analgesia that continues into the post-operative period. These regional blocks are also effective in controlling pain in the immediate post-operative period. However, as the block wears off, patients begin experiencing increased pain. Compared to patients treated without regional blocks, these patients will often experience a rebound pain--pain occurring 12-24 hours after surgery that is subjectively worse than that in patients treated without regional blocks. Therefore, the investigators propose to use a continuous infusion of anesthetic in order to provide sustained pain control post-operatively. Preoperatively, patients will be randomized into a single shot peripheral nerve block versus a continuous infusion of peripheral nerve block. Post-operatively, pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (1-100) prior to being discharged from PACU. Time to discharge and amount of pain medication taken will be recorded. Patients will be contacted at certain time intervals postoperatively to assess their pain scale and pain medication intake. Patients will be seen for routine post-operative follow-up visits where they will be assessed for satisfaction, pain, residual neurological symptoms, and signs of infection.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients at least 18 years old.\nMale or Female\nAll racial and ethnic groups\nFractures and fracture/dislocations of the foot, ankle, tibia, fibula, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand\nPatients who opt for surgical treatment of their fractures.\nPatients who consent to be randomized.\nPatients who are willing to follow-up for a minimum of 52 weeks.\n\nLet's think step by step. <NAME>, <NAME>\n\n### Problem\n<NAME>!",

Telemedicine has been shown to be effective for delivery of many disease states in the literature, including chronic and acute diseases. However, these results are mixed. Objective: To systematically review literature evaluating telemedicine interventions in clinical practice compared to usual care. Method: We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews utilizing Medline (Pubmed) and PsycInfo searches and conducted hand searches. Inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses that evaluated care using telemedicine as a means of intervention compared to usual care and included outcome measurements related to hospital utilization, mortality, costs, patient satisfaction, and measures of disease control. We included only articles written in the English language and published before July 2019. Exclusion criteria were: studies evaluating only telemedicine as an educational tool, studies with interventions solely based on telemonitoring or providing support and training to medical providers, telemedicine with the sole purpose of communication that does not provide direct medical care, and outpatient care that does not provide care for an urgent issue. Results: Seventeen articles were included after filtering process. Conclusion: Results are mixed regarding effectiveness of telemedicine interventions for management of chronic and acute disease states. However, evidence suggests that telemedicine interventions may facilitate healthcare access and improve mortality in underserved populations.\n\n# Introduction\nTelemedicine has been utilized in healthcare delivery for patients in rural or remote locations and with limited access to inperson care providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the importance of telemedicine for provision of care to people without access to healthcare in person. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, healthcare providers should understand how telemedicine can enable and enhance the provision of medical care. Telemedicine can provide care to individuals living in areas with limited access to medical care, such as those who live in rural areas",

So, if you see an example in this manuscript that is not in the right form, refer to the corresponding book chapter.\n\n[INST] Hello. You are asked to write a function to identify whether a pair of a person and a car seat is correct for a child. Given a pair of (person, car seat), you should output \"True\" if the pair is correct. By comparing the mass ranges, you can easily tell from their names whether the person and the car seat is a correct match for the child. Note that there are two types of car seats. As shown in the example below, there is a seat with a mass range from 70 to 130 lbs and another with a mass range from 150 to 240 lbs. \nPerson 1: 120 lbs\nCar seat #1: #202\nCar seat #2: #202\nThe answer to the above problem is True.\n\nIn this example, I assume that you know the following information:\n1) a range in mass of the car seat,\n2) a range of mass of the person's body,\n3) a person is able to fit in the car seat, and\n4) the car seat is fit for the person.\nIn this way, you can easily tell when a pair of a person and a car seat can go together by comparing the mass range. Then you can easily tell when the person's mass is outside the mass range of the car seat.\nSo, I would like to propose to implement a method to tell when a pair is correct for a child using the following steps:\n- First, create a set named `has_mass_range` which will have only people whose masses are included in the mass range of the car seat. `car_seat` would have a set named `car_mass_range` which would contain all the mass ranges of the car seats to which a child can be put.

Results: 213 patients were referred with a cough. Only 61 patients (28%) had chronic cough (age: 3 months to 15 years). The cause of chronic cough was identified in 57 of 61 (93%). The most common cause of cough is bronchitis (42%). Conclusion: A targeted history and examination are most useful when dealing with a child who has cough. Paediatricians should consider the various cough aetiologies in order to provide the most appropriate treatment.<EOD> Neuroimaging of posttraumatic stress disorder in civilian adults\nAbstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent worldwide, has many negative consequences, and often is left untreated. An expanding body of literature has identified structural, functional, and biochemical abnormalities in the brains of individuals with PTSD, which can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the neuropathology of the disorder. This review summarizes neuroimaging research on adult civilian PTSD to better understand neuropathology in this diagnosis. Research using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and magnetoencephalography reveal alterations in brain structure and function, particularly in the regions involved in executive control, memory, attention, perception, emotion regulation, and sensorimotor integration. Although findings are mixed, there appear to be distinct brain-based profiles for individuals with PTSD and those with nontraumatic anxiety disorders. This review suggests future directions for research, such as",

A highly significant decrease in calculus formation was observed (Group I: average of 0.009/7 mm2, Group II: 0.047/7 mm2). In addition, the total value for the calculus formations in the gingival area was significantly higher in the non-operated patients. Contradictory results are presented in relation to the number of patients with periodontal diseases (50% in Group I and 40% in Group II). The present investigation indicates a positive influence of the internal biliary bypass operation on the formation of calculus in the oral cavity, thus, confirming, on the whole, other studies on the effect of biliary secret substances on the calculus formation. The results obtained regarding periodontal diseases are not fully comprehensible and require further investigation.<EOD> Interplay of light and dark reactions during photoautotrophic growth and dark carbon fixation in the marine chrysophyte Ochromonas danica\nLight\u2010modulated dark carbon fixation (LDCF) is an important phenomenon in unicellular algae. The marine chrysophyte Ochromonas danica performs LDCF during photoautotrophic growth when a suboptimal light intensity is supplied. However, the light intensity under which LDCF occurs remained unknown and therefore it is difficult to investigate the regulatory mechanism for LDCF. Therefore, the present study examined both photoautotrophic and mixotrophic (photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth) conditions using 13C\u2010labelled NaH",

Most studies of analgesic agents have used hypertensive subjects as well as normotensive subjects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute hemodynamic response to acetaminophen in the hypertensive patient. Fourteen hypertensive subjects (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg) were studied. An electrocardiograph, a blood pressure cuff, a cuff for the middle finger, and a cuff for the lower leg were placed on all subjects. Subjects lay supine for 15 minutes before receiving 650 mg acetaminophen. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every 3 minutes for the next 45 minutes. There were no statistically significant changes in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, or cardiac index.

In addition, the design of the spectrometer is such that it contains minimal optics, in contrast to the state-of-the-art spectrometers that require a reflective grating, and it has low mechanical vibration, which provides additional robustness to the instrument during high-throughput in situ experiments. The spectrometer's performance is demonstrated through measurements of a liquid-phase reaction, a gas-phase reaction, and a combustion reaction.

Twenty clinical features were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with the sentinel lymph node metastasis and predicting the possibility of lymph node metastasis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTumor location, tumor diameter, tumor pain, and depth of lesion presented significant differences between lymph nodes negative and positive status. Among all the 66 patients, univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that location (P=0.008) and size (P=0.039) were potential factors related to sentinel lymph node metastasis. With the combination of tumor location, size, and pain, the sentinel lymph node had been predicted in 63 patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that all of the three clinical features were capable of distinguishing the sentinel lymph node metastasis to some extent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is a more accurate method in clinical practice compared with the use of only one clinical feature. Location, size, and pain would be predicting risk factors to sentinel lymph node metastasis.<EOD> An Atypical Presentation of Hemi-Irreversible Deformans-like Plaque on the Dorsum of Toe.\nDear Editor, Irreversible leucodopa deformans (ILD)-like leprosy is the rarest type of leprosy.

It has long been used as an analgesic and adjuvant drug in traditional Chinese medicine. The present study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of SAE. Biosynthetic (SAE-B) and a SAE-C were prepared by biosynthesis and C-phycocyanin extraction and separated by DEAE Sephadex A-50 fastflow chromatography. The effect of the three SAE forms on neutrophil infiltrion and TNF-and IL-6 production were compared in an LPS-induced animal model. 1) Pretreatment with SAE-B, but not SAE, increased NO and IL-6 in LPS-induced mice. SAE-B and SAE-C had comparable effects. 2) The SAE-B and SAE-C inhibited TNF-secretion better than SAE in activated neutrophils. 3) The inhibiting effect of SAE on neutrophil infiltration lasted for 7 d while SAE-B had an effect lasting for up to 14 d.\n\n# Introduction\nInflammation is a protective re- sponse of the body to irritation by infective organisms, toxins, or physical trauma. The early stages of the inflammatory response involve an influx of inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leucocytes, into the site of injury to remove the irritants. Substances released by neutrophil in response to infection and tissue damage are important mediators of inflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the earliest producable markers of inflammation, is considered to play an essential role in in flammation, because this cytokine activates the hypothalamic -pituitary axis to produce the major acute-phase protein, C-reactive protein [bib_ref]  Interleukin",

The COVID-19 pandemic has a major influence on every part of human life, from the global economy to household finances. The lockdown in Europe and North America in March and April 2020 resulted in a significant change in personal attitudes to healthy food and living and increased the importance of a healthy lifestyle. However, a change in eating habits (in particular, increased consumption of food and diet supplements), as well as an unhealthy lifestyle, may lead to overweight and obesity and, as a result, to an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease progression, including hospitalization. One study of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in China found 26.6% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a body mass index (BMI) (bodyweight divided by height squared) of 30% or greater [bib_ref]  Impacts of Obesity, Smoking, and Gender on COVID-19 Severity and Viral Load, Yu [/bib_ref] .

This abnormal autoimmune response can result in damage to many parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, lungs, heart, brain, intestines, and kidneys. Both genetic and environmental risk factors are involved in the development of lupus, but these are poorly understood.~SLE has an overall 10-year survival between 80 and 90%. However, we estimate that severe lupus not responding to the usual available treatments has a 50% mortality rate in 10 years. Kidney problems occur in 30% to 50% of lupus patients and may progress to kidney failure. Kidney disease due to lupus occurs more frequently in African-",

Subsequently, the effects of known 5\u2010HT antagonists on these receptors were determined by measuring the maximal decrease in blood pressure following the administration of exogenous 5\u2010HT. Increasing doses of ketanserin, metergoline, cyproheptadine or metergoline were administered prior to the administration of exogenous 5\u2010HT. The doses of 5\u2010HT utilized in these studies were not themselves capable of inducing an appreciable hypotensive effect. A significant reduction in the duration and an increase in the lag time was seen in the hypotensive response to 5\u2010HT in a dose related manner. Using the standard methodology to estimate the degree of receptor blockade, a good correlation was obtained between the dose of the inhibitors and the potency of their effect. This suggests that exogenous 5\u2010HT acts through 5\u2010HT2 receptors in vivo and, thus, this action can be reversed by 5\u2010HT2 blocking agents.<EOD> Preliminary results of the use of a laser speckle phenomenon method in aortic surgery.\nAIM\nThe preliminary results of using laser speckle phenomenon (LSP) to examine the blood flow velocity is presented to compare with the results of standard flowmetry, which measure the volumetric blood flow.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTen aortic surgical patients were enrolled in the study.

So that devious methods of making psychology the property of the medical school will be less effective. For example, the number of psychology professors in medical schools will be diminished and some of the clinical departments will eventually be wiped out, since the departments of psychology are more numerous and more successful. Another method which will have less effect is the adoption of a department of psychiatry. This adoption of a department of psychiatry results largely from the efforts of a few dedicated men who are trying to break away from the psychiatry-psychology battle ground by taking a neutrality course. They hope to be able to accomplish a compromise which will result in the creation of a department separate from psychiatry but of sufficient attractiveness to psychiatry in order to result in its assimilation. The danger here is that in trying to accommodate psychlogy by creating a department of psycl-heiranlty, we may actually end up with an unstable and nonproductive department. Another way in which we might hope to accommodate psychology without creating a department of psclnchiiaky is by simply appointing psychiatric professors to chairs of departments of psychiatry and clinical departments of other specialiues. But such a course is fraught with difficulties, chief among which is the danger to the stability of the departments of psychiatry and other clinical departments. Once departments of psychiatry and psychology are created, the faculties will tend to grow up into little ghettos and it will be impossible to maintain the relationship that the faculty will want with one another and with the rest of the medical school. The final compromise that will satisfy the medical school and college as well as the other members of the psychology department will be for the medical faculty to allow the medical school to appoint the chairs of departments and, in addition, to provide a professor of psychology of its own as the sole chair of the departmetlt of psychology.

Recently, a surprisingly good scaling behavior in the magnetic field at edge plasma has been found in the tokamak. However, the magnetic field variation in fusion plasma and the underlying dynamics are far beyond solar wind. In this work, we perform a statistical analysis of the magnetic field evolution for a total of 200 fusion discharges with advanced H-mode edge tearing modes (ETMs) on DIII-D tokamak. We find that the magnetic field evolution shows a power-law variation in the radial position, where the scaling exponent (beta) increases dramatically from 0.55 to 0.95 with the ETMs. The magnetic reconnection also displays a unique scaling behavior. The width of magnetic current sheet in ETMs is 13 times larger than the one without ETMs. These results demonstrate a complex reconnection process and a large-scale self-similar structure are excited in the magnetic field evolution at the plasma edge.<EOD> .\nRNA-based gene therapy for human diseases will be increasingly applied as the result of the development of new vectors and delivery systems and the improvement of strategies for gene transfer.

Although many of these babies do well, studies have shown that a significant number of infants with IUGR may die in the perinatal period either at birth or due to neonatal morbidity. There are many factors that may play a role in this outcome. Some studies have shown that certain antenatal complications are more common in babies with IUGR and result in a high prevalence of morbidity in early life. Another factor may be the degree of growth retardation affecting the baby. Studies have shown that as the degree of growth restriction increases, there is a decrease in the number of survivors and an increase in morbidity and perinatal mortality. Because babies with IUGR are at high risk for both perinatal death and neonatal morbidity, they need to be carefully monitored and managed immediately to minimize their risk for poor outcome.<EOD> .\nBotch is one of the major causes of neurological disease, and the etiology is often obscure.

Accurate assessment of tumor nodal stage and extra-thoracic metastatic disease is critical for staging lung cancer and guiding surgery and neo-adjuvant therapy. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-D-glucose labeled with fluorine 18 (18F-FDGPET/CT) has emerged as a highly sensitive diagnostic tool in oncology. Several recent studies have reported the high diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially when it is used in combination with CT. To investigate the potential benefits of PET/CT scan over conventional CT in diagnosis of nodal extension and extra-thoracic metastasis in patients with NSCLC, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the major electronic databases with no restriction to time. Quality assessment was performed using standardized criteria. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT were calculated using random effects and bivariate models. Twelve studies (3166 patients) on PET/CT for diagnosis of nodal extension and 7 studies (2365 patients) for extra-thoracic metastases in NSCLC were included. 18F-FDG_PET-CT showed a pooled sensitivity of 95% and 96% and specificity of 90% and 92% for nodal extension and extracervical metastasis, respectively. Furthermore, it showed very high negative and positive likelihood ratio with high diagnostic odds ratio value for both nodal extension and extra-thoracic metastasis. 18F-FDG-PET scan was more sensitive than CT for nodal staging and metastasis detection, and it improved the diagnostic accuracy of conventional CT scan.<EOD> Prevalence, and Characteristics of Antibiotic Resistant Corynebacterium and",

Still, there are a lot of factors that affect the trial's eligibility, so it is beneficial to look at the most influential factors.

Electroacupuncture (acupoint injection), electroacupuncture (manual acupuncture) and nonacupuncture were applied at two acupoints (Li 3, PC 6) and two non-acupoints (one on each side of acupoints) in rabbits. After 15 days, serum levels of \u03b2-endorphin, substance P, substance P(1-7) and substance P(13-25) were determined by enzyme-linked immuno-adsorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that electropuncture (acupoint injection) significantly decreased the serum levels of \u03b2-endorphin, substance P and substance P(1-7), increased the level of substance P(13-25), whereas electropuncture and nonacupuncture exerted no significant effects on them. The findings suggest that the effects of electroacupuncture (acupoint injection) are not mediated by serum opioids or substance P, but they may be mediated by substance P(13-25).<EOD> A comparative study of gonorrh\u0153al phage groupings by the plaque method.\nSummary\n1.\nPhages from gonorrhoeal strains of Neisseria as well as from the normal oral flora have been grouped by their plaque formation.\n\n2.\nEach of the gonorrhoeal phages forms small plaques; these are about as wide as the host cells but only about one-third as deep and they have about the same",

The cell populations were cloned and characterized to determine if a common alteration was responsible for their resistance to cisplatin.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY\nThe cell lines were evaluated for platinum accumulation, glutathione content, and oxidative damage using flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth cisplatin-resistant populations accumulated significantly smaller amounts of cellular platinum (17 times more in MCF-7 cells and 8 times more in RPMI 2650 cells) compared to their parental cisplatin-sensitive cells. Glutathione levels were also 3 times higher in both resistant cell populations.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nData suggest that alterations in glutathione levels and decreased cellular platinum accumulation may contribute to the drug-resistant phenotype of these two cell lines.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCell lines with decreased intracellular platinum accumulation are resistant to cisplatin-induced oxidative damage.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility.

[MOD]\n\n## Tips\n\n## Sample\nYou should prepare a sample that will be used for evaluating how you should tune the hyperparameters of your machine learning method since you cannot evaluate your machine learning methods perfectly using the test dataset. When you apply the machine learning methods, you cannot evaluate the performance of your methods. For this purpose, you will need a sample.\nThere is two types of samples. One is a sample whose labels are known for you. The other is a large sample (not a few hundred but a few hundreds of dataset) whose labels are unknown for you. This is where you need to do the fine tuning. Both will be good for you.\nFor the sample whose labels are unknown for you, the more the more data the better the sample quality would be. This is because there could be many cases with labels that you are not sure how to label but you have to choose from a particular label. For example, for a training dataset in bioinformatics in the field of genomics, we can make a sample that is a gene that is known to be related to a disease whose functions are unknown. If this is the case, the more training data, the more data that is not related to that disease label, the better you will learn the labels of unknown cases (genes).\nIn the following, I give you some suggestions about how to prepare a sample.\n(1) [MOD]\n\n## Hyperparameter tuning\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the hyperparameter tuning is important to find a good setting of training and evaluation hyperparameters. For finding a good hyperparameter configuration, you will try to adjust a variety of hyperparameters of a machine learning method by yourself.\nThe most recommended is grid search of hyperparameters. With it, you need to set an n by n grid whose size is N times M. Then each cell of the grid has K values and you compare these K values. As for finding the cell with the best hyperparameter, you need to calculate the results of each cell for evaluating the machine learning methods.\nAnother method is called random search of the hyperparameters. Although the random search method is not so recommended, you can expect good results as well. That is why I recommend random search of the hyperparameters as an option.",

These polyamine-based block copolymers resemble the architecture of commonly used polymeric gene delivery vehicles based on polyelectrolyte complexes and may facilitate drug delivery comparably well due to the inherent hydrophobicity of their hydrophobic blocks. However, their ability to solubilize hydrophobic drugs remains to be assessed. Here, we report a detailed analysis of three cationic amphiphilic block copolymers of different architectures to evaluate their drug solubilizing capacity in terms of their physicochemical properties and ability to promote cellular uptake and delivery of poorly soluble model drugs. The three investigated polymers share an aliphatic cationic hydrophilic block of the same length consisting of eight repeat units of the amino acids lysine, glutamine, and alanine. Two other hydrophobic blocks of different length are incorporated that can be either natural polyisobutylene (Pib) or synthetic polycaprolactone (Pcl) or synthetic polypropylene (Pp). The Pib-based block copolymers exhibited better solubility of the hydrophobic drugs than the two investigated Pcl- and Pp-based block copolymers. In addition, copolymer architecture had a notable influence on the self-assembly as the Pp-based polymers showed the strongest tendency toward micellar self-assembly. The amphiphilic nature of the polymers was confirmed via turbidity measurements that displayed two transparent transition points indicative of critical micelle concentration.

Total 3600 one-dayold male Arbor Acres male broiler chicks were allotted to an experimental pen on a normal diet with or without 250 ppb dioxin. The dietary dioxin did not affect body growth, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, spleen and thymus relative weights, as well as serum testosterone and estradiol concentrations. Moreover, the dietary dioxin did not change the body weight, organ relative weights, and blood parameters such as glutathione, malondialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activities. In our study, the dietary dioxin upregulated the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 of the thymus, with a downregulation of spleen interleukin 17. These results indicated that dietary dioxin could negatively regulate the cellular immunity of the male broiler chickens.\n\n# Introduction\nDioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorines are collectively called dioxins, which pollute the environment and endanger human health. The European Food Safety Administration has determined a tolerable daily intake of dioxins as 14 pg and recommended the safety limit of dioxins to be less than 1 pg per day for humans. The average estimated daily dietary dose for dioxin is 11 ng of TEQ (toxic equivalent)/kg body weight. Thus, the average",

The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), a major effector of nitric oxide (NO), is activated by binding of cGMP in a substrate-specific manner to cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) encoded by two genes, PKG-Ialpha and PKG-Ibeta. This study is to evaluate the roles of two human PKG (PKG-Ialpha and PKG-Ibeta) isoforms in human trophoblast cell migration.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe cells were treated with and without a selective PKG inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS or transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for each PKG isoform, and the expression of PKGs was measured. The activity of PKG was measured by Western blot analysis and kinase assays. The chemotactic and invasive effects were evaluated by Boyden chamber and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment of human trophoblast cells with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS induced a dose-dependent 50% inhibition of cGMP-induced activation of PKG. The activity of PKG was completely inhibited by transfection with PKG-Ialpha, but only partially inhibited by PKG-Ibeta siRNA. Chemical inhibition of PKG-Ialpha (but not PKG-Ibeta) by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS significantly reduced the migration and invasion of human trophoblast cells. Transfection with PKG-Ialpha siRNA increased the chemotaxis of trophoblast cells approximately 7 times above control siRNA transfected cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that cGMP-dependent protein kinase Ialpha in human trophoblast cells regulates",

Despite being active against a wide range of cancer cell lines, their modes of action are not yet fully determined.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nUsing a combination of cell lysate activity assay and high resolution differential scanning fluorometry, we screened a series of 7-thiazolopeptides for selective activity against a panel of cancer cell lines and to probe the structural features that influence antimitotic activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA series of 7-thiazolopeptide compounds were tested on a panel of 12 cancer cell lines of different origin, as well as on one normal cell line, MRC5. High resolution fluorometry was used to monitor conformational changes of \u03b1Tubulin in response to binding of ATPs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA subset of ATPs displayed potent selective antiproliferative activity in most pan-cancer cell lines of our panel. Compound 4, for example, was four to five times more potent in inhibiting the proliferation of cancer compared to non-cancer cell lines. These ATPs induced similar structural changes in tubulin indicating a possible mode of action.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that compound 4 is a potential antimitotic drug lead and the results of the analysis of other compounds, including 10, reveal a structurally defined, functionally active and potentially druggable region that warrants further drug development against cancer.<EOD> FGF3 in Hedgehog pathway regulation of cerebellar granule cell development\nFGF3, an endogenous secretory growth factor, is expressed in various regions of the developing central nervous system (CNS) in a mosaic pattern.

While this is a global issue, there is increasing pressure internationally to ensure that research undertaken in developed countries is of comparable quality to that originating outside of developed nations. Objectives To evaluate whether Indian medical research is of sufficient scientific quality to meet acceptable international standards. Methods We obtained a random sample of 60 peer reviewed journal articles related to animal models published in high impact journals in India and compared them to Australian and American journal articles of equivalent citation status. Quality indicators used to evaluate the research included adherence to reporting standards, the use of laboratory animal facility guidelines, and consideration of ethical factors including the requirement to perform sample size calculations. Results The results indicate poorer quality standards and research practices with respect to those undertaken in high impact journals in developed countries. Conclusions If international standards are to reach low to middle income nations there is a need to target capacity building programs at those countries currently participating in such research.<EOD> High Resolution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy Provides Insight into the Nature of Copper Sites in S. aureus Nisin-Stable Listeria monocytogenes Biofilms.\nCu-based compounds have recently been demonstrated to be effective antimicrobial agents that operate by the oxidative stress-driven induction of redox cycle enzymes which results in a loss of microbial function and viability.

The role of care assistants within the rehabilitation team, however, has largely been unexplored.Aim: The aims of this study were to gain an understanding of the role of care assistants in delivering rehabilitation in the home and to explore their perceived training needs. Methods: Mixed methods were employed, including focus groups and semi-structured interviews with 14 staff (10 care assistants and four nurses) as well as an online survey of all 33 care assistants employed by the research commissioner. Results: Care assistants play an integral role in supporting client engagement with rehabilitation and are actively involved in the delivery of some aspects of rehabilitation. However, they also felt that they lacked the knowledge and skills needed to deliver neurological rehabilitation and requested further training in areas, such as manual handling, assessment and documentation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the diversity of roles played by care staff, highlights the importance of the role of care assistants, and confirms the essential nature of their contribution in supporting client rehabilitation at home.<EOD> A study of the acute effects of exercise on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline\nFour chronic asthmatic patients on orally administered theophylline were each studied on three separate occasions.

We interviewed 18 family physicians and five oncologists to collect descriptive data on their views and experiences. Three of the five oncologists had the most positive experiences, whereas the family physicians reported some negative experiences. One of the family physicians felt that cancer patients needed to come to terms with the implications that \"a disease that is so serious may be incurable\" before making chemotherapy decisions in accordance with their own needs, values and desires. Most oncologists reported that patient participation increased their confidence in the final decision. Other benefits included improved communication with the patient and increased understanding of alternative treatments. All clinicians who used the patient decision aid in the context of an actual patient reported that it had the potential to reduce the burden of decision making. However, a key area of concern was the lack of specific information about side effects of various treatments.<EOD> Prevalence, incidence and associated risk factors of HIV-1, HIV-2, and dual infections in women in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire: The ANRS 12203 DARLING cohort study\n\nHIV-1 has replaced HIV-2 as the dominant strain in West Africa.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the proportion of maternal deaths due to bleeding was 11.9% in 2015. As the blood supply to the organs decreases, ischemia occurs. Therefore, if the blood circulation is not restored, the organs will lose their functions eventually. Hence, in addition to the hemostatic treatment, resuscitation procedures are essential for the maintenance of basic body functions such as cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The aim of the treatment is to avoid multi-organ failure due to hypovolemic shock. Postpartum hysterectomy is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice, but it can only be performed when the severe and ongoing blood loss can not be controlled. Therefore, effective hemostatic agents are essential in order to maintain hemodynamic stability.\nVasopressin and oxytocin are hormones present in the blood. They were first isolated in the 1890s by Sch\u00e4fer and Verschuer. Hemostatic agents containing vasopressin or oxytocin work by enhancing uterine blood flow and thereby accelerating hemostasis. These agents were thought to be effective in the uterine atony and delayed postpartum hemorrhage (DPPH). Aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme enzymes, has been used by itself in the treatment of anemias of the blood deficiency. Intravenously administered aminolevulinic acid is transported through the bloodstream to the liver and converted to heme proteins there. The formation, storage and circulation of heme proteins depend on each other. Heme protein, which results from the metabolism of aminolevulinic acid in the liver, is secreted into the liver cells through the bile. The heme proteins are transferred to the bile through the bile ducts, and then to the",

The job of an inference is to provide an optimal value of the objective, which is to maximize the number of patients who are eligible to specific trial. The second thing is optimization, which is to reduce the number of necessary trials by removing unnecessary patients.\n\n[INST] Hello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to make an optimal estimate of the trial-level eligibility for 50 patient and 21 exclusion criteria. When making your assessment, you are aware that the objective of the eligibility assessment is to minimize unnecessary trials.\n\n[SOLV] There have been a total of 50 patients and 21 exclusion criteria. First, calculate the trial-level eligibility.\nThe trial-level eligibility for patient i is [code]\n[formula]  if x i \u2229 R i \u0338 = \u2205 then trial eligibility i = [code] [code] [code] [/formula] \nwhere x i is the patient i, and R i is the set of exclusion criteria for the i-th clinical trial. The trial-level eligibility for i is the number of patients who pass the trial at the i-th setting.\nSecond, infer the optimal trial-level eligibility for 50 patients and 21 exclusion criteria by using the greedy method. The greedy method is used because this is an easy, simple and practical algorithm to find the optimal combination of parameters. First, we randomly select a patient from 50 patients. Second, we choose the trial setting that provides the best chance to refer the patient. Third, we iterate the same process 50 times. [OUTP] You have created 50 datasets, each of which contains 50 patients and 21 exclusion criteria. The first dataset describes the trial-level eligibility for the 50 patients. Finally, the trial-level eligibility of the 50 datasets is shown in Figure 2-1. The most informative trials are given high trial-level eligibility.\n\nAs you know, in a real-world setting, the total number of experiments is unknown because of random and uncertain elements.

I found the text in the second line under \"Factors allowing one to participate.\" to be vague and not specific as to inclusion criteria. \"Criterion 1\" is much more specific than your criteria which, I believe was \"Clinical trials in surgery or gastroenterology.\" I have to ask where this comes from. Some studies use both adult and pediatric patients while others limit their enrollment to one or the other. Does this mean pediatrics are excluded? What about pregnant women who are excluded from most of clinical trials? What about patients who have a medical condition that would preclude them from having a clinical trial intervention?\n\nNow, I'm going to ask really stupid questions which will tell me a lot about your code. In the \"If\" clause, how are you determining a score of 2 vs 3? Also, what happens when a person satisfies all the criteria for \"Clinical trials in surgery or gastroenterology?\" For instance, that was the case for the third person (I got to look at that part of the test first thing). As for the other part of the text, \"Trial (C.15), this text in conjunction with the person having satisfied trials (A.1, B.1, A.4, B.4, C.14, and C.16),\" does this mean if they meet one of the trials they will get a score of 2, even if they don't meet all the criteria for one trial? In that very last comment, I'm very confused by your statement, \"A score of 2 could be interpreted as referring the patient to the clinical trial, but not to the point where it actually happens.\" What does that even mean for a score of 2?\n\nOne of my other major difficulties is how I don't think the question actually calls for a score to be returned, and that I think the question is vague in terms of what score you would need to return. I don't think the question calls for some exact score, perhaps the only information needed is yes or no. For instance, does the score need to be one or greater?

The MRI and MRSI findings of 7 MLL-type FCD, 1 FCD-M, 8 FCD IIa, and 13 FCD IIb specimens were reviewed for T1 and T2 hyperintensities, signal changes in MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and were correlated with the microscopic histopathological features.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeuronal migration abnormalities (e.g., balloon cell degeneration) were the hallmark of the dysplastic lesion. T1 and T2 hypointensities were observed in both FCD types IIa and IIb compared to the MRI findings of MLL-type FCD and FCD-M. In addition, FCD types IIa and IIb were more often encountered in perirolandic areas compared to MLL-type FCD and FCD-M. Overall, cortical thickening was also demonstrated in only FCD types IIa and IIb. In FCD IIa, both DWI and MRSI were useful to detect the dysplastic changes. In addition, the hyperintense area of the 3D-MRSI images demonstrated higher methionine levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study demonstrates that T1 and T2 hypointensities, cortical thickening,",

Once you have identified the candidates, you must record the assessment of trial eligibility (e.g., trial-level eligibility) for each patient in the note.\n\n### Challenges\n\nOne of the important factors in clinical trials is the recruitment of sufficient patients to the trial in due time for statistical analysis. Thus, it is important to have a sufficient number of patients enrolled with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria in a short period of time. A number of challenges must be faced to achieve the goal.\n-  To select participants from a huge population for clinical trials is hard work in statistics, bioinformatics, computer science, and business.\n-  The recruitment of patients for each clinical trial should be considered carefully.\n-  Each patient must be assessed in terms of trial eligibility.\n-  The patients enrolled should not be random and the eligible participants should be selected based on various factors by statisticians.\n-  The recruitment is done by trials in various departments of a company. For instance, patients with a certain type of malignant tumor may be more appropriate candidates for a trial investigating a new breast cancer drug.\n-  The number of patients in a trial should be adjusted depending on the clinical relevance, and so an increasing or decreasing number of patients may be needed during a trial or a specific period of time in the trial.\n-  Once the elig",

Previous investigation of outcomes following appendicectomy has suggested that specialist surgeons and high volume centres have fewer negative appendicectomies (i.e. the appendix found to be non-diseased), although there has not been consistent association found between hospital type or surgeon experience and complication rate or admission rate.~Scotland has 3 dedicated children's surgery centres but straightforward children's surgery such as appendicectomy is also carried out in the country's general surgical centres.

The immunohistochemical analysis was performed with the anti-PCNA MAb (PC10 clone, Novocastra). PCNA was evaluated by a modified method and classified into four scores as follows: PCNA-, PCNA<3.0%; PCNA+, PCNA from 3.0% to 19.9%; PCNA+++, PCNA from 20.0% to 59.9%; and PCNA++++, PCNA from 60.0% to 79.9%. Thirty-seven of 54 patients (68.5%) showed PCNA expression with a mean score of 3.9%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found two different patterns of PCNA expression. First, patients with IFN nonresponse had the highest PCNA expression (mean, 4.63; P = .02). Second, survival was higher in PCNA-HCCs than in PCNA+ and PCNA++ HCCs (mean, 33.0 and 22.1 months and 27.7 months, respectively). Although PCNA did not show a significant correlation with tumour burden or Child-Pugh status, PCNA expression could be an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio , 4.34; 95% confidence interval , 1.77-10.6; P = .001), after adjustment for the degree of liver function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that PCNA expression can be a prognostic indicator of response to IFN treatment in advanced HCC.

The samples were placed in anaerobic sacks and transported immediately to the laboratory and frozen at -20 C until assay, with the exception of the second trial, which was conducted at the feedlot pens to avoid the added stress of transportation. Pure cultures of bacteria from fecal samples were obtained by the use of selective nutrient media in pure culture by spreading technique. Bacteria were identified by the use of standard methods. At the dairy the feces of cows contained 8 predominant bacteria of the following genera: 3 strains of Bacillus, 2 strains of Lactobacillus, and 1 strain each of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas. The predominant bacteria recovered from the feces of young calves purchased and maintained in the feedlot pens for several weeks and their dams included the following: E. coli, Bifidobacterium, Bacillus, Lactobacillus, a gram-negative rod resembling Aerobacter, and Enterobacter cloacae. Fecal samples of 6-month-calves purchased at weaning and maintained at the feedlot pens for several months contained only small numbers or E. coli, Bifidobacterium, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus. The calves purchased at weaning contained large numbers of Pseudomonas and Enterobacter cloacae, whereas Enterobacter cloacae and a gram-negative rod were isolated in high numbers from fresh feces of cows.

        "output": "<EOD> A novel method for isolation of the ectocervical human papillomavirus-host DNA junction region using a biotinylated consensus primer.\nA consensus primer was established by combining degenerate and non-degenerate (universally conserved) base pairs of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and the L1 region of all sequenced human papillomavirus (HPV) types. This consensus primer was biotinylated to prepare genomic DNA libraries in which all 12 HPV ITR types could be amplified. PCR products were fractionated using microcapillary electrophoresis (a microchip electrophoresis procedure) and the predominant products were subcloned in bacterial bacteriophage vector pUC18. In this paper, we show that restriction endonuclease digestions combined with microchip electrophoresis could selectively enrich the HPV ITR cDNA sequences as well as those containing the putative HPV integration sites (ITS). Nucleotide sequences of the clones demonstrated that integration of HPV into the host DNA occurred near the transcriptional promoter region of various target cell genes, including a zinc finger transcription factor ZNF617. The ITS was further characterized using a newly designed biotinylated consensus primer that recognizes the HPV ITR sequence. Cloning and sequencing of the region revealed one or multiple integration points.<EOD> The development of diagnostic criteria for the chronic fatigue syndrome\nThe aim of this paper is to explain the process through which the diagnostic criterion for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was developed in order to provide a basis from which to judge the appropriateness of the criterion both for research and clinical practice.

A critical examination of the final result shows it to have a sound conceptual foundation. The validity of the criterion is discussed in relation to the way in which it was designed and developed: the degree of consensus found across the Working Group's responses to the many decisions encountered is examined and compared with international criteria for research and clinical use",

Cancer and its treatments can cause cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment from cancer therapies have significant consequences for the patients and their quality of life. We report a systematic review of cognitive interventions to manage cancer-related cognitive impairment and a systematic review of those studies that investigated the effects of treatment. Methods A literature search was performed in July 2017 for all studies evaluating interventions for cognitive impairment. A systemic review was performed to identify studies investigating the effects of cancer treatment. Each study design was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results Twenty-four studies evaluating cognitive interventions for cancer-and treatment-related cognitive impairment were identified. Study methodology was heterogeneous, sample sizes were small, and the level of evidence varied. Non-pharmacologic interventions with the highest quality of evidence and treatment interventions including the highest levels of evidence were reviewed. Conclusions This review provides a valuable source of evidence for oncology clinicians interested in implementing interventions for cancer-related cognitive impairment into their practice.

This retrospective nonrandomized study used a historical cohort trial of 287 SAA patients who underwent TCD PBSCT (N = 140) or CD34+-selected PBSCT (N = 147) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2013matched siblings (MRD or MUD). The patients and their parents were asked to voluntarily fill out a 2-year follow-up questionnaire describing the development of GVHD, immune complications, infections, and so on. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) (II\u2013IV) development rate within the first 3 months, survival, relapse, rejection rate, severe infection, and immune complication rate from 1 month to 2 years after the transplantation were compared between the 2 groups. The incidence of acute grade II\u2013IV aGVHD was significantly higher in the TCD population than in the CD34+-selected population (14.6% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.041). At least 1 complication involving opportunistic infections or immune complications within 2 years after the transplantation did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (73.6% vs. 71.1%, P = 1.000). The patients in the TCD population had 3-fold higher rejection rates within 3 months of transplantation (9.7% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.001) than those in the CD34+ population, and 2-fold more infections with opportunistic pathogens (36.4% vs. 1",

For the first time in the history of the genus, H. japonicum was introduced from Japan in 2005 for use in biological control of larvae of Hydropsyches japonicus Mayr and Sailer. An effective strategy for conserving, monitoring, and applying natural enemies is necessary in agrosystems. DNA barcoding methods and the use of molecular markers, such as microsatellite DNA, are becoming essential to understand biological control programs and for population genetic analysis of natural enemies. In the present study, the genetic diversity and structure of Korean populations of H. japonicum were assessed by examination of microsatellite markers. A series of seven microsatellite loci were first screened to determine the extent of variation in each population. Then, a total of 314 individuals collected from three sites were analyzed to examine patterns of variability and relationships among individuals for the identification of genetic differences among the populations. Although the average level of diversity was low among the total populations, the mean number of alleles per locus among populations ranged from 2.40 to 4.15. Mean observed heterozygosity (H(o)) in the populations ranged from 0.410 to 0.545, and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.347 to 0.488. All loci were found to be polymorphic and in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations. Genetic differentiation was higher between the two localities in the north (Hongsu-ri and Eunmyo-ri) than between the two sites in the south (Huk-ri and Mugyeong-ri), although pairwise F(ST) estimates were lower and ranged from 0.015 to 0.028.

Complication of psychological problems among female may worsen the quality of life even more. This study aimed to study gender difference in the association between stroke survivors' anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL) in China. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 175 (107 female) stroke survivors in Jinan, Shandong province, China from December 2020 to November 2021. Patients' anxiety level was measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ9) was used to evaluate depression level, and QoL was assessed using 26 items of the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES_R). The data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0. Multivariate linear regression was performed to examine the associations between depression and/or anxiety and QoL in each gender, separately. Results: The levels of depression and anxiety were significantly high (Mean score \u00bc 13.67 versus 12.43, Mean score \u00bc 5.93 versus 5.22; P < 0.001). Both anxiety and depression were significantly associated with each other (P < 0.001). QoL was lower in females survivors than males (48.19 versus 55.42, P < 0.001), in which the scores of \"intrusion\", \"inactivity\", and \"total scores\" were especially low. After covariables adjustment, anxiety and depression were both significantly associated with all items of QoL in males.

These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that the synergy between cochlear electrical stimulation and acoustic stimuli which is necessary for perception is localized to the auditory nerve.

The assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: Not eligible; probably eligible, and definitely eligible. \nThe clinical trial of this patient note is as follows. Title: Clinical and Personality Variables at Baseline Predictive of Outcomes of a Multidisciplinary Intervention for Adults at High Risk for Prostate Cancer. Summary: The overall purpose of PA-SCOPE is to determine why black and rural residents of Pennsylvania might be at higher risk for deadly, debilitating, and costly hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - and then to show that repeat acute exacerbations in highrisk patients can be reduced with one simple intervention. We believe that 1) COPD patients who are black or who live in rural areas of Pennsylvania are at higher risk of acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization and 2) this elevated risk can be reduced with one simple intervention: access to a 1-800 Temple Call Center where patients can get immediate customized advice on managing COPD exacerbations in their early stages. We will test these beliefs in PA-SCOPE. The collaborators with Temple University Hospital on the PA-SCOPE project are Lancaster General Hospital, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. We will study the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention for men at high risk for prostate cancer (HRPCa), comparing a randomized trial (Group A) with another group (Group B) provided with the intervention but allowed to choose their own care.

This may represent a risk for lung damage through the release in the extracellular environment of potent cytolitic cellular granular contents such as granzyme-A (Grz-A) and perforin.\nCurrently, very little is known about the mechanisms of this damage.

The diagnosis was made with transnasal flexible laryngoscopy which confirmed the presence of a fibrinopurulent lesion in the subglottic zone, and a laryngeal biopsy that confirmed the presence of granulomas, composed of epithelioid cells in a background of mixed inflammatory infiltrate. No clinical or radiological data support the diagnostic of malignancy. The treatment was topical glucocorticosteroids associated with a short course of corticotropin.

Cultured HPAECs were exposed to either normoxia (21% oxygen), or hypoxia (1% oxygen), or exposure to hypoxia and with added ginsenoside Rg1 or the angiotensin receptor antagonist irbesartan for 6, 12 or 24 h. VEGF concentrations were measured in HPAECs exposed to the following regimens: Normal, hypoxia, hypoxia+Rg1, or hypoxia+irbesartan. The hypoxic environment is associated with a significant increase in VEGF concentrations, which are decreased in the presence of irbesartan. This result was unexpected, as irbesartan is a potent blocker of VEGF production and angiogenesis. In contrast, hypoxia induced in HPAECs a significant increase in VEGF mRNA expression, which is increased further in the presence of ginsenoside Rg1. Furthermore, VEGF protein expression is increased in HPAECs treated with ginsenoside Rg1 under chronic hypoxia. Taken together, our data suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 counteracts the effect of chronic hypoxia and upregulates VEGF mRNA and protein expression. Ginsenoside Rg1 is therefore a promising candidate drug for treatment of hypoxic pulmonary artery disease.<EOD> The 2016\u20132017 winter seasons for influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B in the United States: A comparison of the relative contributions of the influenza B Yamagata group and Victoria group lineages and their relationship to influenza A (H3N2) infections and antigenic matches\n\nThis is an Open Access article distributed",

The p24 antigen detection has a lower sensitivity (and specificity) than reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and is only efficient at an advanced stage of the infection. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of HIV-1 RNA is time-consuming and costly and requires expertise. The use of thymidine analogues (TAs) for the detection of HIV-1 infection is based on the incorporation of TAs in HIV-1 DNA. The TA-labelled HIV-1 DNA and unincorporated nonlabelled HIV-1 DNA are detected by polymerase chain reaction. Two main procedures using either TA-labelled HIV-1 DNA (RT-LDA) or unincorporated non-labelled (RT-LA) are used. We performed a critical review using the QUOROM statement. It concerned mainly the quality of studies and the clinical significance of this new procedure in adults. Efficiency (sensitivity) compared to conventional tests for HIV detection was always higher for RT-LDA (82-100%) and also higher than 96% for RT-LA (96-100%) (11/12 studies). Specificity of the two techniques was always greater than 90%. However, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated on patients with confirmed HIV infection (diagnosed by other conventional methods than TAs or RT-PCR. These data, like the relative inexp",

In this article, we review research findings regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of a range of psychedelics (ketamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ) and provide a detailed discussion of the clinical considerations and practical steps for integrating psychedelic therapies into healthcare systems and clinical practices.<EOD> The importance of the nonconservative amino acid changes for the structural changes in the antigenic site on the VP7 structural protein of bluetongue virus serotype 8 in comparison with bluetongue virus serotype 3\n\nBackground: Bluetongue virus (BTV) is one of the most devastating diseases of ruminants (sheep, goats, and cattle). BTV is comprised of nine capsid-encoded proteins. As an external capsid protein, the major viral protein VP7 plays an essential role in host cell attachment and tissue tropism of BTV. However, the VP7 protein of some BTV serotypes showed a different reactivity among the antiserum-positive animals by western blotting. Thus, the objectives of this study were to identify the possible causes that led to the difference in the reactivity of VP7 from the serotype 8 (BTV-8) strain from a different serotype by reverse genetic methods.Results: In this study, four different nucleotide sequence mutations (C9U, C198T, G442A and G454A) that resulted V9U, T198S, Q158K and K155N amino acid changes, respectively, were identified. Interestingly, the C9U is not only located at one end of VP7 but also results in the removal of a potential glycos",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Would not refer this patient for this clinical trial; 1) Would consider referring this patient to this clinical trial upon further investigation; and 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 63-year-old man presents with cough and shortness of breath. His past medical history is notable for heavy smoking, spinal stenosis, diabetes, hypothyroidism and mild psoriasis. He also has a family history of early onset dementia. His symptoms began about a week prior to his admission, with productive cough, purulent sputum and difficulty breathing, requiring him to use his home oxygen for the past 24",

Your main responsibility as a participant will be to come to all required clinical study visits and to follow the treatments as prescribed. You will be asked to not consume any alcoholic beverages during the clinical trial. In addition, you should avoid taking any nutritional supplement and antioxidant medications during the course of this trial and for 6 weeks after the trial.\n\n\tYou may be discontinued from the clinical trial treatment protocol and/or the entire clinical trial at the discretion of the sponsor, investigator, sub-investigator(s) or designee(s). In the event that the clinical trial is discontinued before you have been discharged from the study clinics, every attempt will be made to arrange your return travel home or to a place of your choosing at the sponsor's or investigator's expense, and to reimburse you for any related expenses. you may be allowed to leave the hospital before all clinical study visits are completed. During the entire clinical trial, we will keep an eye on your health status and will provide necessary medical care to be sure that you are as comfortable as possible. In addition, you will receive free medication, free lunches and be provided free reimbursements for any costs of travel. It would greatly help if you could remember to take your medication as prescribed, bring any notes of side effects to the study clinics and tell us about your thoughts of the study.\n\n### Eligibility Criteria ##\n\nHere is a template of Eligibility criteria:\n\n\n\tAll patients will be at least 18 years old.  \n\tThe inclusion criteria include:\n\t1.

Central patterns of this type (e.g. segmentation, axis formation, and body wall formation) are generally considered to initiate by a series of discrete organizing events or centres, and are often accompanied by specific gene expression patterns. In the sea urchin embryo, the Sp5 gene initially has the same spatial expression in all cells as the major axis-forming gene, Spl. However, the timing of expression becomes gradually restricted to the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), where it remains expressed throughout the rest of development and is also required for the maintenance of this territory. Although the localization of the PSM is obvious in the histological stain, a molecular marker has not been identified. Here, we cloned a sea urchin specific bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) which is expressed in a stereotypic pattern in the PSM of H. pulcherrimus, M. franciscanus and T. gratilla embryos. The Bmp4 protein also accumulates at the centre of the PSM, and its expression is reduced in sptl-1 and spln embryos. By injecting Bmp4 mRNA at two-cell stage, we found that the PSM forms at the normal position, indicating that the localization of PSM is not entirely a consequence of its spatial expression pattern. Expression of a Bmp inhibitor, chordin, is also strongly expressed in the PSM. Expression of chordin is regulated by the Sp5 gene, and is restricted to the PSM in spl and sptl-1 embryos.",

Echocardiography was performed on 147 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median follow-up duration was 26 months. Myocardial dysfunction, defined as decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 50%, was identified initially in 21 patients (13%). Nine others developed myocardial dysfunction during follow-up. Five had severe depressed LVEF (less than 30%). Median LVEF was below 50% in patients with and without cardiomyopathy. No patient had cardiomyopathy before treatment with mitoxantrone. Patients with cardiomyopathy had significantly decreased LVEFs compared with those without cardiomyopathy (median LVEF, 42%, range 0%-30% vs median LVEF, 65%, range 48%-59%, p = 0.002). Cardiomyopathy occurred soon after the initiation of chemotherapy in most patients (median elapsed time, 0.5 years), but it appeared later in 4 more patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that mitoxantrone therapy may cause myocardial dysfunction in a substantial number of patients.

We evaluated a modification of the method using a mechanical diluting device to enable the use of the same dilution to obtain both mean platelet count and blood volume for the haematocrit measurement. Since only slight differences in platelet volume were found by the 3 methods and the results for platelet volume correlated well with mean platelet volume, the results were grouped and compared. The method with the Orca counter provides the quickest and most convenient mean platelet volume determination.

An example is the classification and regression tasks, where each input data is forwarded into the network layer by layer, then the last network layer generates the corresponding output. The whole neural network structure is similar to a human brain where an image is transformed into a brain structure through layers of neurons.\n\n### What are typical neural network architectures for image classification or regression?\nTypical architectures in image classification include DenseNet-121 and DenseNet-169. You could also perform image classification using deeper architecture of the dense network, e.g., DenseNet-201. Typical architectures of image regression include dense-32 and dense-32-1 for small and large datasets, respectively.\n\n### What are the advantages of using a neural network as a classification system?\nTraining a neural network as a classification system is much like performing a human visual assessment. Neural networks are capable to find patterns to make a prediction.\n\n### What are the components of the model and the data of a neural network example?\nThe model of neural network example contains three hidden layers comprise of \"Dense\", \"ReLU\", and \"Dense\", and three layers of output layers.

This section shows you how to apply it to the real-world application of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). \n\nLet's imagine that you are a PhD student studying CDSS in a university. While reading through the library books in the library, you come upon a book titled \"Developing a new generation of clinical decision support systems\". In this book, you find some useful methods and techniques. You have summarized the contents in the following:\n\n- `Clinical rule-based system`: Rule-based systems represent a subset of rule-based systems. The difference lies in the structure. Clinical rule-based systems use clinical events and phenotypes to generate rules.\n\n- `Fuzzy inference system`: Fuzzy methods are generally used to represent knowledge rules in a crisp and clear-cut way. They do this by expressing rules in fuzzy terms. This way, a rule's crisp membership function is combined with an appropriate fuzzy number using the operational law. The output of the fuzzy method is obtained by applying these membership functions. In the end, it is processed using the set of fuzzy rules described.\n\n- `Expert system`: Expert systems use a knowledge base. The system receives a set of problems or queries, analyzes the problem according to certain rules, and returns the appropriate decision based on their reasoning.\n\n- `Bayesian approach`: Bayesian inference is a method that allows the probability of an event occurring to be determined. Bayesian inference is mainly used in medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical decision-making.\n\n- `Artificial neural network for medical diagnosis`: An artificial neural network (ANN) consists of a set of artificial neurons. A neuron has three components: the input, weighting, and summing of the inputs, and the threshold. The ANN is based on a supervised learning algorithm.\n\n- `Genetic algorithm`: Genetic algorithms operate in search environments in an automatic way, and search for a solution. In the first phase, a population is defined over the given search space. In the second phase, one individual is selected randomly as the parent, the other individuals are called offspring, and the new generation is generated by mut",

The RPT  cultured in such a medium expressed only low levels of HLA class I molecules. However, when RPTC  differentiated to resemble the in vivo tubular counterparts, the expression of HLA class I molecules increased dramatically. This increase resulted in enhanced immunogenicity of RPTC  to autologous lymphocytes as determined by a graft versus host assay. These results demonstrate that human RPT  can be induced to differentiate in vitro and that the expression on RPTC  of HLA class I molecules represents a marker of RPTC  differentiation.<EOD> A critical assessment of protein identification workflows for shotgun proteomics.\nIn recent years, advances in technologies, enzymes and databases have increased the usefulness of shotgun proteomics methods for the characterization and identification of proteins.

The VA access skill set requires a comprehensive knowledge base and proficient procedural skills. A recent review of the research demonstrated a significant need for a focused learning program on critical care nursing skills. Therefore, this study was conducted to measure the pre-test and post-test knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA's) and to investigate the effectiveness of an accelerated vascular access training program. The study included 50 critical care nurses who participated in an accelerated program of three training days covering basic to advanced nursing VA skills, and assessment (24 hours over three days). The effectiveness of this program was measured using a series of questionnaire surveys and assessments administered 6 weeks prior to the accelerated training, 3 months after the acceleration program and 6 months after the training. The pre-training scores and post-training skills were compared using a statistical process control (SPC) chart. The chart showed that skill performance and the confidence rating in VA competency, increased after the program, indicating that the acceleration program improved skills. In conclusion, the results suggest that this program can enhance VA practices of critical care nurses.<EOD> Neuroprotective potential of penta-acetyl geniposide and its derivatives against ischemic stroke.\nDespite advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of stroke, the number of fatalities continues to rise.

In the early phase of shock the increase in blood lactate was more than twice that of pyruvate and more than five times that of glyceride. Later in the course of shock blood pyruvate rose markedly, whereas blood lactate declined. The extraction ratios for both blood lactate and pyruvate were high during shock and both increased thereafter. After shock had been induced, infusion of glucose or insulin into the blood was followed by an increase in blood glyceride, indicating that gluconeogenesis was present. It is concluded that a marked increase in lactic acid fluxes occurs at an earlier stage during shock than indicated by an increase in the level of blood lactate.

The patient eligibility assessment workflow consisted of five phases consisting of a search of the database patient note, information extraction of patient-specific information, information integration of the extracted patient information with the inclusion criteria of interest clinical trial, assessment of patient eligibility to the clinical trial, and trial-level eligibility output. \nThe proposed system uses the Python programming language to accomplish all the phases of the proposed patient eligibility assessment workflow.\nThe patient eligibility assessment is one of the most critical tasks in a clinical study due to the necessity to select the best suitable patients for the clinical study. Accurately and timely finding the best suitable patients to participate in the clinical study is beneficial for selecting the best candidate who could improve the study outcomes. Otherwise, conducting a clinical study with unsuitable patients has been leading to unfavorable research outcomes, increase in clinical errors (such as medical errors and patient treatment errors), and delay in conducting a clinical study in a timely manner. Thus, the proposed patient eligibility assessment can play an essential role in selecting the best-suited patients for a specific clinical trial which help to conduct the clinical study in a timely manner. \nThe strength of this study is that we have developed a new method with our systematic way to assess which factors of a clinical study the patient needs to be fit to the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial and it is very helpful to select the best candidate with a complete assessment.\nThe limitations of this study were also ascribed to the performance of searching, extracting, integrating, and comparing the clinical note of the patient with that of the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial. Besides, information retrieval from the EHR was also a challenge. However, the system proposed in this study is able to assess the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial, except patient-related information retrieval.\nThe patient eligibility assessment workflow proposed in this study provides a new approach to assessing patient eligibility to a clinical trial by extracting the patients' information from the EHR and comparing it to the clinical",

Drowning the rat in water reduced the effects of the NH3 atmosphere. Anaesthetized (nembutal) rats showed an intermediate response. Sodium benzoate, sodium lactate and oxygen prevented a decrease in base excess in the rat and guinea pig. The effect of oxygen was small. Sodium benzoate combined with sodium lactate had a greater protective effect than either alone, but this was less than sodium benzoate and oxygen combined. Oxygen combined with benzoate and lactate had the maximum protective effect. The minimum arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid ammonia concentrations giving irreversible damage in rats were not different, whether benzoate and lactate were used to raise ammonia, or whether it was administered by itself. These concentrations were, both in brain and arterial blood, well below those that could be present in circulation in other types of poisoning. This study therefore failed to show in the rat a direct neuro-toxic effect of arterial ammonia which could not be mediated through liver dysfunction.",

Oral and GIT mucosal surfaces are colonized by numerous microorganisms, which include pathogens that cause infectious diseases and commensal non-harmful species. There are several immune tolerance mechanisms operating at these mucosal surfaces and various immunological processes such as Th1, Th2, Th3, Th17, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cytokines have been thought to be involved in the immune responses at the mucosal surfaces. In addition, interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells result in various immune-mediated responses. These localized immune responses must be carefully regulated.

The presence of coumarins, especially 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, 7-hydroxy-6,8-dimethylcoumarin and isopimpinellin decreased the photodecomposition of Ce(IV). The photodegradation of salicylaldehyde in the presence of Ce(IV) in the dark became very slow when 7-hydroxycoumarin or isopimpinellin in the same order of concentration was added. For pyrocatechol, the photodecomposition rate constant of Ce(IV) in the dark became smaller when a little amount of isopimpinellin was added and this value was almost negligible when isopimpinellin in five times larger concentration was added. The results indicate that 7-hydroxycoumarin and isopimpinellin may act as sensitizers of ultraviolet irradiation to the catalytic reduction of Ce(IV) by donor substrates.<EOD> Inter-rater reliability of a comprehensive list of functional disability criteria for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain\n\n [fig_ref]  Table 2: Reliability statistics of each criterion [/fig_ref]  [fig_ref]  Table 2: Reliability statistics of each criterion [/fig_ref]  \n\n## Reviewer\n\n## Hensel",

At the same time, the former group is prone to spend less time on video games compared to patients with OCD. It should be noted that more than two thirds of the patients play video games no more than once a month.

However, it is not known which signaling pathways induce IL-8 expression. In the present article, mouse bone marrowderived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with Mtb, and the expression of IL-8, growth-related oncogene \u03b1 (GRO\u03b1), and its regulator, osteoprotegerin (OPG), were evaluated. We demonstrated that IL-8, GRO\u03b1, and OPG mRNAs are not induced in control conditions or in BMDMs infected with an attenuated strain of mycobacterium, which has no capacity to replicate inside macrophages. In a more interesting situation, although there is an increase in NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in cells infected with attenuated strains of mycobacterium, none of these mediators are induced.

Succ induces malignant hyperthermia and transient hyperglycemia with fibrinogenolysis and hypofibrinogenemia by its metabolic degradation under continuous regional arterial infusion, which is rarely reported. A 61\u2010years male was undergone right carpal tunnel release. During operation, he complained of hyperesthesia and sweating, an intravenous administration of rocuronium was followed by an arterial venous exchange catheter. An injection of Succ into the arterial line immediately induced muscle twitching, transient hyperthermia and extreme hyperglycemia (up to 668 mg/dL) within 18 minutes. Transient ischemic encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis and tachycardia developed and were improved with repeated flumazenil and crystalloid and colloid solutions administration. After the procedure was finished hemostasis was ensured by a tourniquet and a bandage dressing and fibrin clot was noticed on the field. After one week, fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A became normal.

        "output": "<EOD> Development of an ultrasensitive photoacoustic flowmeter for in vivo studies.\n\na b s t r a c tWe developed a laser wavelength sweep photoacoustic flowmeter used for a detection flow velocity range covering three orders. The flow meter combines a wavelength sweep photoacoustic imaging (PAM), an ultrasound (US), and a fiber-optic bundle. The optical fiber-optic bundle is used for the light delivery and the light collection in the flow-speed measurement. The signal processing and display system makes the photoacoustic flowmeter easily adaptable to flow measurement applications. We evaluated the performance of the system using a flow tube and a miniature circulatory loop with different flow rates. We confirmed that the measurement limit for the flow velocity was higher than 8.3 times higher than that of the conventional laser wavelength-swept PAM, and that no detection limit was found while the flow velocity was much slower than the upper detection limit. Therefore, the developed photoacoustic flowmeter can be used for in vivo blood flow measurements on live small animals.\n\n# Introduction\nPhotoacoustic imaging (PAM) is a newly emerging imaging modality with high spatial resolution in a wide field-of-view. The technique uses the light absorption in the sample to perform the spatially resolved contrast imagingand its advantages over conventional optical/X-ray imaging have been addressed. The photoacoustic imaging systems for small animal or tissue research have benefited from the recent progresses in light source, scanning mechanisms, image reconstruction algorithms and signal processing techniques.\nOne of the interesting PAM applications is the blood flow velocity measurement, which is essential in understanding and diagnosing of many disease states. Since the blood in blood vessels is highly absorbing to infrared light and a large laser pulse energy is required to observe the blood flow, the time-resolved photoacoustics (PA) has widely been used for in vivo blood flow velocity measurements [bib_ref]  Multi-dimensional optoacoustic tissue characterisation with molecular specificity, Schwarz [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  In vivo microvascular imaging with ultrasounda photoacoustic approach, Taruttis [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  In vivo quantitative imaging of hemoglobin concentration and o",

They are harmful to human and animal health as they are strong carcinogenic agents, affect cellular metabolism, and may exert a toxic and mutagenic activity. Aflatoxins in food are a great global concern owing to the possibility of their entry into the food chain. In this study, we investigated the ability of a food supplement containing extracts of desert plants, particularly Cistanche tubulosa (CT), to inhibit the damaging effect of aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has a damaging effect on the cell membrane due to its peroxidative effect. Our aim was to assess the protective effect of the aforementioned extract of Cistanche tubulosa against the liver oxidative effect of AFB1. Our research is based on our preliminary work, where we stated the antioxidant effect of Cistanche tubulosa in a concentration dependent manner by DPPH assay in the presence of lipid peroxidation products. The aflatoxin B1-induced oxidative stress has been characterized by an increase in malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes, as well as protein oxidation. To verify the protective effect of Cistanche tubulosa (CT) extract, the animals were divided into six experimental groups with six animals each: Group I (control) was fed with a standard diet and deionized water; Group II (G2) was fed with a standard diet and drinking water containing CT extract; Group III (G3) was fed with the standard diet and a daily oral dose of aflatoxin B1 (20 \u03bcg/kg b.w.); Group IV (G4) was fed with standard diet and drinking water containing CT extract for 10 days and on the 10th day received AFB1 daily orally (20 \u03bcg",

Methods: In this study, 163 clinical specimens were collected from the inpatient and the outpatient departments, of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and gave written consent. The samples were inoculated into mannitol salt agar and MacConkey agar plates and the isolates were identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using the Kirby-Bauer method. Results: Out of 160 isolates found in the clinical samples, 28 (17.5%) were GNB. The most frequent isolates, however, were Klebsiella spp. 3 (11%), Citrobacter spp. 3 (11%), and Eschericia coli 3 (11%). All isolates showed 100% sensitivity to cefepime, cefotaxime",

Nowadays, more and more people have pulmonary disease and, as a result of this, more and more people are in need of special medical care or require a longer sick leave. It is known that there is a correlation between the duration of sick leave and the pharmaceutical company's market position; which is reflected in the pharmaceutical company's sales and revenue. If there is a possibility that the duration of sick leave will be prolonged, it is necessary to adjust the production plan to the market fluctuations and, consequently, maximize the production volume in a period with the expected higher demand.\nFor the above reasons, you would like to ask about the possible effect of the application of the pharmaceutical company's treatment on the duration of sick leave. Your request is forwarded to a specialized academic center, which will conduct a randomized clinical trial to measure the impact of pharmaceutical company's application on sick leave duration.\n\nHere are the definitions to help you solve the problem:\n\n**Definition 1.** The pharmaceutical company's treatment: pharmaceutical company's treatment is applied to patients with chronic lung disease to reduce their respiratory frequency.\n\n**Definition 2.** The pharmaceutical company's treatment: pharmaceutical company's treatment is applied to patients with an exacerbation of chronic lung disease to reduce their respiratory frequency.\n\nLet's think. \nLet's assume that there is no randomized clinical trial measuring the impact of pharmaceutical company's application on sick leave duration. What impact would you expect to receive if the pharmaceutical company's treatment would be applied to patients with exacerbation of chronic lung disease to reduce their respiratory frequency?

[INST] Above all, we need to build ML models. We'll use the same datasets. There are three types of data:\n\n[INST] Each item in the data set is called a row or datapoint and a line in a histogram. [INST] To prepare the input for the ML model, we apply a preprocessing step to the data, which includes the following steps:\n\n[INST] Before training, it is necessary to select and standardize target variables, which represents the output or label. If the data you have are just numbers, you just have to map the values of the target variable to a scalar (0.0, 0.5, 1.0), to a one-hot encoded vector, or to a categorical value.\n\n[INST] The main role of preprocessing is to convert the raw data to feature representations in a meaningful manner. You should perform it if you haven't done it manually. \n\n[INST] You should load the data and the output variable in `pd.read",

Here, we investigated the anti-neuroblastoma role of HM11940, an aminoquinoline derivative, and determined the underlying mechanism. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, and were further treated with HM11940 under various experimental conditions. Cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were analyzed by measuring the activities of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, trypan blue-staining assays, and ELISAs for caspase-3, respectively. Subcellular locations were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot assays. Causal relationships were analyzed by silencing plasmids, inhibitors, or inducers. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltet razolium bromide (MTT) and trypan blue assays showed that HM11940 dose-and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells and promoted apoptosis. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting showed that HM11940 induced cytoplasmic translocation of JNK and c-Jun, suggesting activation of JNK and its downstream effector, c-Jun.

        "output": "# Discussion\n\nAs you know, SPRINT is defined as the probability of being eligible for a trial. The lower a trial's SPRINT, the more likely that people in the simulated population are eligible for this trial. In other words, the lower SPRINT, the bigger the population. Thus, high SPRINT suggests the better the matching between the trial and subjects. In this example, SPRINT is calculated as follows:\nSPRINT = 79.61 \\%\nFrom the results, we can summarize that the low SPRINTs of 87.3% for 69 yo male, and 63.0% for 30 yo female, means the trial did not capture enough participants, and the trial does not have good matching on age and gender between the trial and the population. Thus, we recommend the trial be designed with different levels of age (young people) and gender.\nFor the example above, the overall median of SPRINT is 50%, and the IQR for SPRINT is 0.34. That means the simulated population could be eligible for the clinical trial with a probability ranging between 50% and 50.34%. Therefore, the trial still needs to be improved the eligibility criteria: (1) gender, and (2) a new age group for 70 vs 80.\nIn addition, we compute the trial effectiveness of the clinical trial with the simulated population and compare its results with those of our sample data. \nIn conclusion, the clinical trial sample data we simulated here is almost comparable to the real data sample data. The main reason for this comparison is to evaluate the eligibility criteria. The trial effectiveness of the clinical trial can be evaluated by comparing the SPRINT with our calculated value. That is to say, if the SPRINT after improving of the eligibility criteria is close to our calculated SPRINT, the trial effectiveness would be improved in the real world. That is, with appropriate trial adjustment, the trial in our example can have a very high effectiveness.\n\n# Methods and results\n\n## The method of simulation\nWe need to make some adjustment on both the trial and the population so as to fit our requirements and simulate a trial with a certain effect",

Sustainable care is defined as 'a continuing process of making effective use of available resources to meet current and any anticipated needs of the population, without jeopardising future availability of services and/or their ability to maintain or improve quality'. Therefore, sustainable care is defined as a multidisciplinary and integrated approach towards care. It is an approach towards improving the care-giver/care-receiver relationship and providing high quality care. This is illustrated by considering the characteristics of sustainable care; namely, community-based care, integration and multidisciplinarity.<EOD> Effects of Tannic Acid on Salivary Protein, Enhancing Antiviral Activity In Vitro\n\nCitation: Faisal, M.; Rashid, N.A.; Liu, W.; Nizamutdinova, F.; Xu, G.; Liu, Z.; Cao, J.; Qaisar, A.A.; Chen, Z.; Jia, X.; et al.

Methods: Patients with HCC who underwent RFA were prospectively recruited. Clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics, including SLIMs, were determined before and after the RFA procedure. Results: Among the 51 study subjects, the mean age was 63.9\u00b18.6 years, and the male-female ratio was 4.8 : 1. The mean ablation time was 8.59 minutes (range, 0.50 to 19.0 minutes), and the technical success rate of ablation was 96.1%.

For example, `Raisins(1:2015, 4:6015, 10:12015)` is a raisin with three subraisins: `1:2015` (i.e., 2015 to 4) = patients, `4:6015`(i.e., 6 to 10) = the patients whose ages are greater than 4 in the range 2015 to 6, and  `10:12015`(i.e., 10 to 12) is used to find the patients who are greater than 10  after the 6th patient. A raisin could be the start and/or end indices of a range (e.g., `6:7` indicates 6th to 7th patient, but it's not a raisin for a range that contains the raisin indices). The range could start from the `1st` patient to the last (or an early patient when the maximum occurs before 1st patient; e.g. start at 12), so it could have the same index 1 to 12 as a raisin. A raisin could also be an entire range, except the last (e.g, if the next patients are greater than 20, e.g, 11:22 then it is one range).  \n- Range: is a raisin with the same start and end index. For example, `1:21`is one raisin, and range for `1:2015`is a raisin with  `10:12015`as one range. A range could be used to form a condition together with two or more ranges.  \n- Filter: a raisin or a range is a",

We therefore examined the interaction between genetic variation in the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) and the depressive symptoms in relation to decision-making under ambiguity and risk in healthy individuals.Materials and methods:The study sample was composed of 466 healthy individuals (50% female) recruited from the Swedish Twin Registry between 2012 and 2016. Participants were assessed for depressive symptoms using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The participants performed a decision-making task under ambiguity (\"ambiguous\" mode) and a decision-making task under risk (\"risk\" mode; a lottery task). Genetic variation in the SLC6A4 promoter region and 5-HT receptor variants was measured using a commercial genotyping assay (Zyge Biosciences).Results:The correlation analysis showed an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and impulsive decision-making [BDI-II versus ambiguous mode, rs(463) = \u22120.13; p < .01]. Furthermore, it was found that this relationship was moderated by the SLC6A4 promoter polymorphisms [(GG)rs 1042173, (CC) rs7248655, (GA) rs1694035",

Guinea pigs were exposed to a cigarette smoke-air mixture six times a day for seven weeks, and an age-matched control group was also established. Alveolar macrophages from the control or smoking animals were studied in culture tissue culture media to determine the in vitro response to aerosol solutions of either whole cigarette smoke or a cigarette mainstream smoke aerosol which had been diluted with air. Responses to inhaled cigarette smoke aerosols and silica were also measured. Guinea pigs were exposed by the nose-only route to either a suspension of silica (100 mg/m3) or a cigarette smoke (Davis Lucky Strike or Marlboro Medium) aerosol for one hour a day, five days a week for two weeks. A 24-hour post-exposure lung lavage was conducted at the end of each week. Cultured cells from both control and smoke-exposure animals appeared to respond in a similar fashion when challenged by cigarette smoke or mainstream solution, although the inflammatory response in smokers appeared to be lower. In smokers, exposure to a smoke aerosol, but not a silica aerosol, resulted in significant decreases in total inflammatory cells as well as neutrophils in the lavage fluid after both one week and two weeks of intermittent smoke exposure. In non-smokers, neither smoke aerosols nor silica produced any significant changes in any inflammatory parameter.<EOD> Genetic and environmental influences on the adult height of identical and fraternal twins.\nDNA fingerprints of MZ twin pairs from the Danish Twin Registry were used to study the aetiology of the variation in adult height in 235 Danish identical twin pairs and 476 twin pairs of the opposite sex, constituting",

(1993) reported that 98 (32 per cent) out of a total of 304 pigs were shedding S suis type II on nasal or buccal swabs. This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous study by Tirloni et al. (1991) that showed that 31 per cent of 289 pigs examined were shedding S suis in the nasal cavity. On the other hand, Nockler (1993) found S suis type n2 on mucosa samples from 82 per cent out of a total of 367 pigs with skin lesions. All the animals included in the three studies had been kept in the same experimental farm. As pointed out by the authors, the differences in the prevalence of S suis are most probably related to the way in which the bacterium is identified. In all these studies, S suis was identified and detected by means of serological examination. Furthermore, Althaus et al. (1993) also used bacteriological examination. Although the authors claimed that their results showed that more than one third of their animals were positive for S suis, they did not indicate which S suis type was the predominant one in their pigs. Recently, we examined in 1020 slaughtered pigs from 20 farms the nasal swabs for S suis type n2 with a commercial kit (RIS SB, Hoefer, Germany) that was designed for identification of this serological type in human sera. The identification of S suis type n2 was carried out by enzyme immunoassay according to the instruction of the kit. The samples were examined immediately after slaughter, before starting skinning. None out of the pigs was positive for S suis type n2 (data not shown). Although we cannot exclude the fact that the pigs included in our study were positive for S suis type n2, their prevalence would be very low. In light of the fact that about 30 per cent of slaughtered pigs in Switzerland is considered to be positive for S suis type n2 (",

We give a score of 0 (pass) or 1 (fail). If we cannot find or can only find one eligibility criterion (e.g. age), we give a score of 0 (pass) and a score of 2 to find two or more (fail). \nIf the patient meets other criteria of the eligibility of the clinical trial, we compare the findings of the patient to the corresponding criterion. If the finding is in line with the specific criterion, we give a score of 1; if the criterion is violated, we give a score of 2. \nIf the patient does not match the criterion (e.g. the patient was not treated with chemotherapy), we check whether the patient needs to be excluded. For example, if the patient meets at least one of the exclusion criteria of the clinical trial, then we give a score of 2 (fail), otherwise we give a score of 1 (pass). \nIf the patient does not have any of the criteria for exclusion, then we continue checking for the criteria from the main objective of the clinical trial. If the patient matches either of the criteria for the main objective, we give a score of 1 (pass) or 2 (fail). \nIf the patient does not have any of the criteria for the main objective, then we check for the criteria of specific objectives of the clinical trial. We score each criterion the same way either as failure of pass depending on the fulfillment of the criteria. \n\nThe scoring manual for each criteria is in the following chapter.\n<EOD> Effect of oxygen plasma pretreatment on the bond strength between composite resin and",

In this report, we showed that E. coli strains lacking tig grow poorly on certain nitriles when the tyg gene is also absent. Moreover, the presence of a tig gene and a tyh gene together was sufficient for the growth of tig single mutant cells on the same nitriles. The tig gene or the tyg gene was not required for the growth of the cells on nicotinic acid or pyrimidines. We therefore suppose the product or some product of the tig gene or the tyg gene may be involved in nitrile transport and/or metabolism. There are probably two systems of transcriptional regulatory proteins for the utilization of nitriles. When tig-containing transcription factors are active, tig and tyg are required for the utilization of some nitriles. When other regulatory proteins containing other amino acid sequences replace tig and tyg, the other transcription factors may take the place of tig-containing transcription factors and nitrile utilization may occur even when tig is missing.<EOD> .\nA total of 6253 blood serum samples were investigated for the antibody content to herpesviruses I-VII and 299 cases of viral hepatitis B were established.

Yet disaster-ready models for nutrition and palliative care services are lacking. An interdisciplinary team of researchers collected descriptive qualitative data from frontline service providers in 5 humanitarian organizations and local government officials across Bangladesh and India. Participants were interviewed about nutrition and palliative care service delivery before, during, and after disasters. Thematic and descriptive analysis were used for data interpretation. We learned that a range of nutrition and palliative care services are available and delivered before and after disasters through mobile clinics and nutrition centers, supported by coordination activities such as the creation of new guidelines for service delivery. Additionally, 3 unique, 2-way communication strategies were identified, including mobile clinic and health center communication, telephone and short messaging service (SMS)-based communication, and local volunteer\u2013mediated communication. These findings indicate that emergency response and recovery models for nutrition and palliative care services are available in Bangladesh and India. To better strengthen these models, guidance on key approaches for improving nutrition and palliative care services during disasters can be leveraged. Additionally, the importance of disaster-specific models, especially in the context of COVID-19, should be explored further.<EOD> .\nA study has been made of the role of adenosine deaminase (AD) in serum and spleen lymphocytes as the mechanism of impairment in immunocompetence of thymus-deficient mice under the action of inactivated vaccine against rabies.

Activated Protein C is the serum inhibitor of blood coagulation which, when produced locally by the endothelial cells, limits the propagation of thrombin activation. When abnormalities have been identified within the protein C pathway, the clinical manifestation is known as type I, protein C deficiency. In patients with type I protein C disease, the severity of bleeding varies from mild to severe and some patients have recurrent venous thrombosis or miscarriage. Factor VIII is the precursor of the blood clotting protein factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (VWf), which is central to the biology of platelets and endothelium. When factor VIII abnormalities are diagnosed, they can manifest as factor VIII deficient disease or von Willebrand (VW) disease. The latter manifests as the classical triad of bleeding, increased clotting time and prolonged aPTT.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nA family with a bleeding tendency was studied to identify the underlying defect at a haemostatic level in combination with other factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe have identified a previously unreported missense mutation in factor VIII (R420X) in a family with a bleeding diathesis and type 1 VW disease.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis single mutation results in a severe defect",

In the diagnostic investigation a double procedure is performed. Firstly an in-depth cough history is taken in order to exclude extracough and psychogenic coughs. Secondly, the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity, is done using the methacholine histamine test to measure cough reflex by serial spirometric measurements, and then the determination of the cough reflex threshold (CRT) by the inhalation of increasing concentrations of nebulized inhaled histamine to achieve a cough threshold value and compare it with a CRT threshold value on another day. This inhalation procedure in case of an increased (> or = 2 mg ml) CRT is repeated on another day. This study shows that: a) There is neither a correlation to CRS of the cough productivity in sputum nor between plasma H1 and H3 histamine respectively nor a correlation between severity of cough evaluated on the VAS scale and plasma H1 and H3 histamine; there is also no correlation between severity of cough and cough productivity in sputum. b) There is a significant difference between the histamine provocation (HP) test with a CRT threshold > 24 mg (CP1) and",

Here, we report an ultrasensitive thermoelectric sensor with high transparency in the visible region. Using a microelectromechanical systems fabrication process, we fabricated a 12 \u03bcm thin flexible thermoelectric device by sandwiching an ultrasmall thin thermoelectric layer and two carbon electrodes between a polyethylene terephthalate film, a polyimide film, and a glass substrate. This device can measure the small temperature difference of 8 \u03bcK in a wide temperature range of 20\u221245\u00b0C at the 4-\u03bcm distance from the substrate. The ultralow thermal conductivity (0.087 \u00b1 0.001 W/(m\u22c5K)), \u03ba e is achieved by controlling the grain size of the Bi 2 Te 3 film. Thanks to the low thermal conductivity, a thin thermopile with high detectivity of 4.64 \u00b1 0.02 \u00d7 10 10 cm Hz 1/2 /W is achieved. Owing to the high transparency of the device in the visible region, an infrared image is observed in front of the device.

Levels of Delta(4)T and P were decreased in the menopausal women and further decreased in monkeys (P<0.05). However, there was no change observed in serum level of T(P<0.05). Serum contents of LHRH, LH, FSH, Delta(4)T, P and E2 were positively correlated in menopausal women (r>0.50). Serum content of E2 correlated positively with that of PRL (r=0.7292, P=0.0135).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEstrogen deficiency in menopausal women and ovariectomized monkeys did not alter LHRH serum content.

The majority of cases (n = 10,399 or 85.8%) were of high-risk patients with known cancer. Most of the cancer cases were lymphomas (n = 6,462: 54%). Other cancers analyzed in this study were sarcomas, melanomas, thyroids, pancreas and hepatobiliary. All benign (n = 1,536) cases were from known noncancer patients. All specimens were reviewed in the hospital computer, cytotechnic and pathologist files.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean follow-up of patients with cancer was 76.6 months. Of those patients who died within the observation period the mean survival was 22.7 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEvaluation of the FNA specimens revealed 71.2% of the patients had cancer, while only 48.8% of the patients with diagnosis of cancer at cytology eventually died of cancer. Only 18.8% of the patients without clinical diagnosis of cancer and without evidence of malignancy (false negative rate) subsequently died of cancer.

The objective of this study is to determine the optimum duration of antibiotic treatment for children diagnosed with MP and concurrent COAD while taking into account the occurrence of adverse events during treatment. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in the Pediatric Departments of Hallym University Medical Center and Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital in the Republic of Korea. Children between ages 6 and 15 years diagnosed with COAD and MP pneumonia for >4 weeks were selected, and treatment with azithromycin was initiated for 5 days. Among the 106 patients included, 102 were treated with azithromycin for 5 days until their follow-up examination at 7 days. These 102 patients were then randomized into three groups: 1) 5-day group, in which azithromycin was given for 10 days; 2) 10-day group, in which azithromycin was given for 15 days; and 3) placebo group. Adverse events, clinical symptoms, and changes in spirometry and chest computed tomography were monitored until 3 months post drug withdrawal. After 1 month (8.94 \u00b1 3.06) and at 3 months (8.98 \u00b1 3.01), the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was not significantly different between any of the treatment groups. Mean change in FEV 1 at 1 month and at 3 months was not significantly different between the 5-day group and the placebo group but exhibited significantly differences in both groups compared to the 10-day group. However, no adverse events occurred in any of the treatment groups. Our findings are a basis for determining MP infection treatment duration for children with COAD. Future studies with a longer treatment duration or other antibiotics are needed",

Let's give the detailed explanation of the algorithm in next section.\n\nIn this section, we first introduce some definitions regarding to the patient information. The clinical trial will set a specific upper and lower age limit for participants. In order to be considered, each patient must be between the age 13 and 24. The lower and upper age limit of the patient in the clinical trial is defined as 18. Each clinical trial requires that a trial subject is ineligible, if they have had other cancer diagnosis before this clinical trial enrollment. A diagnosis of cancer is defined as a disease in which abnormal cells grow outside their normal bounds and can also invade adjoining components of the host. Diagnoses of cancer are confirmed by tissue samples obtained under the supervision of a medical professional such as pathologists and clinical laboratories.\n\nTo give the patient detailed information, our work focuses on analyzing the pathology of clinical notes. The clinical note has a hierarchical structure which consists of multiple information units. If we observe a patient's clinical notes carefully through the text mining task, the pathologist will annotate this as a clinical note. Each pathology note consists of several sub notes, i.e., the sub-hierarchy consists of the following sub notes (note, diagnosis, procedure). A diagnosis note indicates that the patient has a disease. A procedure note denotes that the doctor performs a surgery. In the case of a note, a sub note can be further divided into sub sub notes (a comment, a comment of a comment). The clinical notes are often not well formatted, i.e., the pathology report is a narrative in which the order of the diagnosis, report, comment note and so forth is not consistent. Therefore, we can get some additional clinical information of patients from the clinical note, such as a patient's gender, history of disease, previous treatments and personal history. \nTo identify patients who meet clinical trial inclusion criteria, we perform a set of experiments using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from text. Because each clinical trial only specifies age, gender, and prior cancer diagnosis for the inclusion criteria, we can apply the following three",

In the present study, we have investigated whether patients with allergic asthma have increased plasma OC concentrations when compared with atopic controls and the influence of inhaled corticosteroid treatment, used as antiinflammatory controller therapy in asthma. The study included patients with asthma (n = 65) and atopic controls (n = 15), all with perennial allergic rhinitis of at least 5\u2010years duration. Blood samples were collected for evaluation of plasma OC concentrations. The patients with asthma received inhaled corticosteroids twice daily. The patients visited the clinic after 6 months and plasma OC concentrations and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were reassessed. Plasma OC concentration was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay.

SGLT-2s is used as an additional therapy in the treatment regimen of T2D due to its glucosuria and hypoglycemic actions. But still, there are many questions that need to be answered to better understand SGLT-2s and improve patient outcomes and better care for individual patients. Key words: SGLT-2i (SGLT-2 inhibitors), Diabetes, Renal Disease, Bone Mineral Density, Weight Loss, Blood Pressure, Renal Function\n\nHere is the patient record:\n1) Intake: Glycosylated Hb A1c 7.5%, Weight = 192 lbs, Height = 69\"\n2) Physical Exam: Cardiovascular system exam: Auscultates with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops present, no edema, no acrodynia. Extremities: Normal skin color and texture, no cyanosis or clubbing present, no edema or dorsal prominence. Pulse is 90/min, regular and normochardic. Mentation appears alert and oriented.\n3) Previous Medical History: Blood pressure (BP) measured 150/96 mm Hg. No acute history of chest pain or cardiac murmurs.

Hydrolyses of aliphatic (methyl, ethyl) and aromatic (methyl and chloro) sulphides were carried out for 3\u2009h in two-phase systems made of polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u2013dextran mixtures and dimethylformamide (DMF)\u2013HCl (4 M), using enzymes prepared with an electrochemical technique. The influence of the following parameters: concentration and molecular weight of polysaccharides, DMF concentration, sulphide substrate concentration and pH of the medium, on the yield of both aliphatic and aromatic sulphides hydrolyses, was studied. The hydrolytic products were separated by centrifugation of the two phases. The results indicate that the hydrolysis of all substrates proceeded with high enantioselectivity. The enzymes, which were obtained in the PEG\u2013dextran two-phase systems were active and stable over a certain range of conditions. The enzymes, which were extracted by PEG\u2013dextran two-phase, had biotransformation efficiency for the aliphatic sulphide substrate, equal to that of the enzymes, which were extracted by an ethanol\u2013HCl phase, and enantioselectivity, which was equal to that of those enzymes, which were isolated by an ethanol\u2013formic acid. Furthermore, the enzyme, which was extracted by the PEG\u2013dextran two-phase was stable over an interval of at least 6 weeks after production.<EOD> Prehospital Use of Intranasal Epinephrine (INE) for Pediatric Anaphylaxis and Clinical Outcome: Retrospective Observational Study\n\nBackground: Prehospital care for pediatric anap",

Are all trials in the study included in [INST] trial-level eligibility? Or not. Why?\n[ANSWER]\nAll trials in [QUESTION] Sieve Python module work by using some specific format to read clinical text and then find the keywords contained in the text. The clinical text comes from a collection of 1000 different patient records, which is simulated from multiple published clinical studies, each being 30 patient records. The keywords in these 30 records are also simulated. These keywords are not only the ones we have considered in the trial-clinical trial eligibility, but also some keywords that are relevant to clinical trials but are not shown in this tutorial because these are not the keywords we want to find. [QUESTION] Sieve will extract keywords with regular expressions for all eligibility criteria from the clinical trial document. In [INST] Sieve Python module, the keywords are defined in a list named `eligibility_conditions`, which is initialized with an empty list and then each element is added recursively by reading the [QUESTION] Sieve Python module documentation and following the pseudocode as shown below in the pseudocode.\nThe keywords will be then parsed into a `Condition` object. There are three types of conditions: `Exclude`, `Include`, or `Require`. The number of condition objects is determined by count. The `Condition` object will contain a key-value pairs with keys being the value (e.g., ID) and values being its corresponding condition (e.g., INCLUSION or EXCLUSION).\nFinally, we define a function `telescope`, which will calculate the scope of each condition in a condition array. For example, when the condition is INCLUSION, the scope should be to read the entire clinical trial data. When the condition is EXCLUSION, the scope should be to read only a part of the clinical trial data.\nIn addition, we set up the key-value pairs between `data_name` and the `ClinicalTrials` object with a property, `doc_id` in the same way.

There is no good answer, but just imagine, \u201cWhat if?\u201c then you should create a new patient note with a new inclusion criteria.\nIt is possible to create any kind of code, in general, but it is too complicated. The number of clinical trials on each electronic medical record system is a lot more than what we have shown you. This means that creating unique patient notes for each trial is impractical. Hence, we introduce the concept of reusable code that provides the basic elements as building blocks.\nIn this way, we create the simplest possible code that contains only the elements required by the clinical trials. At the same time, we make sure that when we create a new patient note we can simply change the trial name and add the elements required for the new trial, but the other basic elements remain the same. In the previous example, the patient note had only the following information:\n\u2022 A patient note: `Name` is the name of the patient note (e.g., Patient Note 2);\n\u2022 Trial-Level elggibility: `Trial-level eligibility` is a patient-level assessment that determines whether the patient is suitable for the trial, e.g., `0` (referred by default), `1` (referred upon further investigation), or `2` (referred without further investigation); and\n\u2022 Trial Name: `Trial` is the name of the clinical trial, e.g., Patient 2\nIf we now imagine a completely different patient note, its code will just look like this:\nNow we can see how the code has changed. In this case, we only needed to change one line of code to create the new clinical trials. Notice that the lines for `Patient` and `Medication` are still part of the code. These two lines for `Patient` and `Medication` indicate that you are creating a new trial and that the patient`s name and names of the medication prescribed do not have to be changed: this information is always required.\n[INST] <EOD> Phenomenology, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis in Thai children.\nTuberculous meningitis occurs in approximately",

The density and surface area occupied by DTS, and the volume of mitochondria were increased significantly along with heart development. The other organelle volume and surface areas, however, showed no significant change. The increase in the DTS surface area was mainly due to the increased density of DTS, but not to the increase in the total surface area. A comparison between the surface areas of ER and mitochondria revealed that surface area of the ER was increasing more and reaching a certain level at an earlier stage. The density and surface area of DTS, however, have increased continuously to the adult stage. The change of DTS surface area along the development was very similar to the change in surface area of the whole cell.

A two-stage experiment was conducted, including 42 participants who underwent brainwave recordings using electroencephalography (EEG) and watched two commercials in a controlled experiment, in a realistic setting. The results show (1) high variability between the EEG measures in responding to the experimental stimulus (commercial), which suggests that these measures are not good predictors of brand attention or the recall of the brand name and slogan; (2) no significant difference in brainwave responses between the two conditions; and (3) very low memory retention performance, with 81.6% of the participants being able to remember neither the slogan of the advertising shown earlier nor the brand presented. Together, the results indicate a low predictive power of EEG measures in consumer advertising. The discussion also considers several methodical issues, including in-lab tests versus field-studies, EEG recording at the beginning versus the end of the commercial, effects of habituation or familiarity, and brainwaves response to TV commercials versus to online-ads.\n\n# Introduction\nT",

Recently, mobile recording has gained in importance, mostly because of the ability to conduct tests in real-world environments, and because of the advantages in reducing set-up time. The possibility to use consumer electronics devices (e.g. smartphones or wearable devices) as electroencephalography (EEG) recording devices has increased the potential for a wider use of low-cost EEG systems. At the same time, mobile EEG systems face additional challenges, as their set-up can be more sensitive to environment-related artifacts in recording quality. Such artifacts can be reduced or improved via a set of algorithms. In this paper, we report a set of steps that can be implemented to further increase the EEG recording quality in mobile set-up. First, we quantized the differences between head and phone and found that the head area closest to the phone (and its immediate surrounding) contains the worst artifacts in the signal. This indicates that electrodes situated nearby the phone are the best choice to record from in a mobile system. Second, the use of a head-mounted (in-ear) electrode set resulted in better EEG signal quality compared to the use of a conventional head cap electrode set, especially for movement-induced artifacts. We observed a difference of 15.7 \u00b1 11.8 dB between the recordings of the in-ear electrodes compared to a conventional electrode cap. Finally, we",

The present study aimed at comparing childrens' scores on DMF and dmf-H and dmf-T indices of dental caries, TF of fluorosis, professionals' perception of dental health of 9-12 year old children attending dental clinics at Jordan University, Amman, and dentists' perception of dental health status of Jordanian children of the same dentition.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA questionnaire was designed, tested and validated; it comprised two parts: one covered demographic data, and the other, the oral health status of Jordanian children as assessed by dentists (group III), and children as assessed by themselves (group II) and their parents (group I). The DMFT and dmf indices were used to assess dental caries status, whilst the TF index was used to record the prevalence and severity of fluorosis. The questionnaire was completed by 386 children, 75 dentists, and 75 parents.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted at dental clinics at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan in the year 1999, and 2000.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant differences (p < 0.0001) were found between children groups with respect to gender, socioeconomic status and educational level. Differences between groups I, II and III with respect to DMF and dmf-T scores were not significant. The difference between the TF scores of group II and group III was significant (p = 0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo significant differences were found between dentists' assessment of Jordanian children's dental health status and children's and parents' assessments of their own health. No significant differences were found between children's dmf-t, DMF and TF scores as assessed by the three groups.<EOD> Changes in Echocardiographic Parameters and Cardiac Output in a Cadaveric Por",

In 1854, Carl Wurtz reported that a mixture of zinc, copper and benzine became intensely dark coloured under alkaline conditions. It was initially assumed that the benzenoid ring had been aromatised but the colour was later shown to be due to the formation of benzidine from the aromatic nucleus and nitrogen from nitric acid. It was in 1865 that Lieschke demonstrated that the conversion was catalysed by water and therefore occurs as the Knoevenagel condensation.\n- The reaction of an aldehyde (1) and a cyano-methylketone (2) in pyridine produces a yellow precipitate due to the cyclisation of the nitrile into a pyridine derivative.\n- The condensation of aldehydes with ketenes to yield hydrazines, e.g. the condensation of acetaldehyde with diacetyl ketone to give hydrazinecarboxamide (3), in acetic acid (HAc) and pyridine is described as the Gattermann reaction.\n- The Bischler-Napieralski reaction is the aromatisation of a ketone in acid conditions catalysed by zinc chloride or hydrobromic acid (HBr) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), in the presence of aromatic chlorides.

The obtained nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (microstructure), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (phase), zeta potential (surface charge), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy (morphology), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) (morphology) techniques. In addition, the optical properties were investigated using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), and morphological structure was investigated using field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The mechanical properties of pure and modified PVA-based films were studied using a mechanical property unit, and the electrical conductivity of films was recorded using a source meter.

However, there was no clinical evidence to support the optimal therapeutic sequence for these patients, and further research was therefore particularly essential. Methods: A total of 16 cases of patients with double-positive lung adenocarcinoma were selected, including 12 cases of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (EGFR+), 3 cases of lung adenocarcinoma, and 1 case of ALK-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (ALK+). Results: A total of 7/16 (63.6%) patients did not receive targeted drugs. However, 9/16 (56.2%) patients were cured, and only 1 case needed further drug treatment due to the early metastasis of the disease. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) of the 9 patients was 30.0 months. The mPFS value of the patients treated with gefitinib plus crizotinib was 20.0 months, while the mPFS value of patients treated with targeted therapy for the primary site and for the brain metastasis of ALK was 30.0 months. Conclusions: For patients with co-altered EGFR/ALK double positive lung adenocarcinoma, the treatment strategy with first line, brain-targeted therapy still remains unclear and may vary based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.

Nebulized salbutamol is a commonly formulated in-use inhaler which shows good results to the clinicians and patients. It is available in the forms of a suspension and a solution. One of the reasons of switching to nebulized salbutamol from metered dose inhaler is the poor reproducibility of drug deposition due to the variation in actuation of metered dose inhaler to nebulization. For example, salbutamol nebulized from nebulizer is around 95% of the formulation, whereas only around 5% is transferred to the bronchoalveolar fluid. The remaining 95% is distributed into the nasopharynx and oral cavity, which leads to unwanted side effects such as laryngospasm and heart effects. Aerosolized salbutamol is an alternative dosage form, which can overcome these challenges leading to improved results and compliance by patients, especially in pediatric cases where in-use inhaler forms of salbutamol are not ideal.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe results of this study indicate that formulation of 20% salbutamol solution nebulized from nebulization chamber can be given at an increased dose with reduced side effects at the same time.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAerosolized 20% salbutamol solution exhibited higher efficacy than regular dosage of nebulized salbutamol inhalation in patients of bronchial asthma.<EOD> .\nThe first experience of percutaneous thrombolytic therapy of thromboembolism from the femoral and iliac arteries is described and the technique used is discussed.

To illustrate the features of our XGB-ETL approach, we removed one field (admit_diagnosis_disorder_iincl_cpx, which is mainly used for billing purposes and not a medical code), one date field (start_time, whose unit is seconds), two foreign keys (admission_id and discharge_id that link the records to their corresponding admissions and discharges), and finally the field 'patient_id' that links the records to the patients. The finalized file has 40 fields in total\n\nAfter the XGB-ETL process above, we have successfully transformed NHIRD inpatient dataset into a suitable structured format for further analysis by XGBoost.\n\n# Results\n\nWe applied an XGBoost model to predict the clinical trial recruitable status in the inpatient notes that did not have a trial-level eligibility score assigned before. We randomly selected five patients as the training set, while the rest were kept as training for cross-validation. We trained on 72 patients and applied the XGBoost model to 16 patients for prediction.\n\n\n# Conclusions\n\n### RQ2: How does XGB-ETL handle missing values in the training data?\n\nOur XGB-ETL is a tree-based engine where missing values within a tree are always kept as nulls. We thus do not have an error for missing values.\n\n\n# Results\n\nIn our inpatient dataset, we randomly selected five patients as the training set",

Macromolecular synthesis was measured by the uptake of 3H-thymidine and 3H-glucosamine and 3H-proline and calculated from total DNA and protein content and total amount of radioactivity. IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 were found at maximal levels of 4.6 +/- 1.2 (37.8 +/- 11.7 and 3.0 micrograms/l) pM, 1.6 +/- 0.6 (465.7 +/- 109.4 and 51.5 pg/ml), 1.17 +/- 0.65 (467.1 +/- 133.6 and 21.1 pg/ml) and 1.9 +/- 1.5 (734.4 +/- 132.6 and 146 pg/ml), respectively.

This study investigated inflammatory response (IR) after treatment with CX.\n\n\nMETHODS\n40 patients who completed the treatment with CX were evaluated retrospectively. IR was calculated by diving monocyte count by lymphocyte count (monocyte:lymphocyte ratio, M/L ratio). IR value of \u22650.19 (19 patients) was considered as IR positive while value of <0.19 (21 patients) as IR negative. Clinical and laboratory parameters and inflammatory ratios of both groups were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe groups were similar in terms of age, gender, tumor side, stage, grade, T status, N status, metastasis and local treatment methods. IR was not considered to affect overall survival in univariate analysis. IR values of patients with local recurrence positively correlated with treatment duration. A longer duration was observed in IR positive group. The rate of having local recurrence was significantly higher in IR positive group (p= 0.003). Also, in IR positive group the rate of having liver metastasis at diagnosis was much higher (p=0.026). At diagnosis 15 (88%) patients were at stage III and only two at stage II in the IR negative group. While IR positive group consisted of 19 (90,5 %) stage III and three (14,3 %) stage II patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough CX treatment has significant side effects, no significant effects on IR were observed. IR positive patients seem to have worse clinical conditions, may need more supportive treatment and may need to be followed more closely. We recommend that IR should be monitored during follow-up of CX treated patients.

That is, by activating the sympathetic nervous system, exercise produces a decrease in satiety, initiating a change in activity level that is related to appetite and/or foraging, increasing brain-satiety, and thereby increasing ventilation as a byproduct of increased brain activity. If beta-adrenergic inhibition of the brain can attenuate that brain-satiety response, it will attenuate the associated hyperventilation. Using a closed-loop circuit, we increased plasma osmolality, to increase the satiety threshold, and measured water uptake in resting (non swimming/non feeding) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). With increased plasma hyperosmolality, water uptake from the aquarium tended to be higher, and that increase in water uptake was prevented by feeding the beta-blocker dipropranolol, but not by nonspecific beta-blocker, atenolol.

Of the people affected by this problem, 68% are women. \nThe current thinking on the development of osteoporosis is that the changes in bone turnover that occur with aging play a major factor. Many modalities of treatment are used to prevent the bone loss and increased fracture risk associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia. Melatonin supplementation may be another treatment modality that lowers risk of hip fracture in perimenopausal women",

[/table] \n<EOD> Sodium deuterium exchange reveals an intra\u2010molecular folding transition in the T4 lysozyme hinge\nThe hinge loop is an intrinsically disordered protein segment that lies between a stable core structure and less stable terminal caps. This region is involved in many molecular recognition events including biomolecular interactions critical to immune function. The bacteriophage T4 lysozyme hinge is a particularly interesting paradigm for studies of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). T4 lysozyme crystal structures are comprised of a disordered hinge followed by a highly folded core, with a single amino acid in the hinge, G208, critical for folding. Recently, residues within the T4 lysozyme hinge region have been found to contribute significantly to the hinge\u2010mediated docking of C\u2010terminal lysozyme homodimers. Here, we perform rapid kinetics NMR studies to obtain an atomistic understanding of the structural features and intrinsically transient contacts that mediate hinge\u2010mediated lysozyme dimerization. We find that the hinge and lysozyme homodimer form rapidly and that a series of intermediates are associated with this process, with a strong contribution of intermolecular interactions. The observed structural and kinetics data imply a complex kinetic scheme involving formation of disordered hinge interactions that are kinetically transient, which can potentially be stabilized upon homodimer interaction.

Ginseng extracts were prepared, and phytochemicals, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunomodulatory activities were analyzed. The phytochemical components (total phenolics and total saponins) were not greatly influenced by HP at 2,500 kPa, and even for the ginsenosides content allergic to some individuals, not influenced HP 40 kPa. The total saponins content showed a maximum increase of 18% by the treatments of HP at 2,500 kPa, whereas phytochemical constituents such as \u03b1and \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, trans-Zeaxanthin, and \u03b3-tocotrienol were substantially increased more significantly by the highest HP compared to the control. The antioxidant potential and radical scavenging activities exhibited increases by treatments of 1,000 kPa. Furthermore, the extracts showed anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, as analyzed by the determination of nitric oxide (NO) production via the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the extracts showed anti-cancer activity in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. In particular, ginseng treated with HP at 200 kPa and 2,500 kPa significantly exerted immunomodulatory activities by increasing lymphoproliferation, phagocytosis, and NO production.

        "output": "<EOD> Increasing healthcare expenditures? Exploring trends in physician compensation in the Netherlands\n\nBackground Despite decades of medical-industry driven increases in healthcare expenditure, the average physician income has remained stable for many decades. While the general inflation in physician income suggests that increases in healthcare expenditures are due to the supply-side factors, such as increases in the number of physicians, we use cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data on the physician wage in the Netherlands to find an answer for this phenomenon. Methods By means of panel data analysis, this paper explores whether increases in physician earnings are related to changes in the income of employees in the same workforce. The analysis is further supplemented with a cross-sectional analysis to investigate the changes in the demand for physicians. Results Empirical evidence suggests that the increase in physician earnings in the Netherlands is not related to the general rise in the average wage in the Netherlands; rather, this is due to a number of factors related to the supply of physicians, including increases in the number of physicians, and a shift towards specialists. It also shows that while the number of physicians has increased significantly over the 10-year period during which our panel data set covers, the wage of a specialist in the Netherlands has gone down. The cross-sectional data point to an increase in the demand for the services of physicians during the study period. Conclusions The increase in demand for healthcare cannot be explained by the growth in the supply of physicians. While rising healthcare costs are often the result of rising number of physicians, we argue that there may be other underlying factors that contribute to this phenomenon.\n\n## Increasing healthcare expenditures? exploring trends in physician compensation in the netherlands\n\n# Introduction\nHealthcare expenditure (HCE), the share of the total gross domestic product (GDP) that is spent in the healthcare sector, has risen over the years, albeit not significantly in some countries. Between 1999 and 2018, the share of HCE in the GDP rose in 33 of the European countries for which data are available, while it remained unchanged in 11 between 2009 and 20",

That is, it is a study of the relationship between the personality scores and some aspect of intellectual functioning. In a previous paper (1) it was shown that personality scores differed considerably as a function of age and also as a function of socioeconomic status. The present study deals with the more complicated problem of investigating whether a personality variable was related to other aspects of behavior in a coherent manner. In particular, it is an investigation of whether personality variables were related to general achievement, or whether they were more closely related to certain specific aspects of achievement. In addition, a comparison has been made between achievement and personality scores in respect to Ss whose IQ's were in the superior vs. those whose IQ's were in the inferior range. The achievement and personality variables selected for investigation were determined, in large part, by the variables that were available on the various tests that Ss used. However, the specific variables which were chosen for investigation have some connection to the broad concepts of general behavior, as well as to specific social functions and to emotional adjustment. To mention only the more important variables included among these concepts, they include: (1) self-estimated aptitude, (2) attitudes toward learning, (3) perfectionism, (4) anxiety, (5) social adjustment, (6) interpersonal dependency (8), and (7) social desirability (9). There is also a set of eight variables which have to do with specific personality traits according to the classification of Eysenck (10, 1",

The growth factors tested were epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF\u20101, FGF\u20102), and the platelet\u2010derived growth factors PDGF\u2010BB, PDGF\u2010AB, PDGF\u2010AA, and PDGF\u2010AB+BB. While each factor stimulated cell growth, only the EGF was found to enhance BPV\u20101 replication when included as part of the culture medium. 6\u2010\u2010purine (6\u2010\u2010TP) and \u03b1\u2010\u2010difluorotoluene (\u03b1\u2010DFT), inhibitors of de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, respectively, were tested for inhibition of BPV\u20101 replication. \u03b1\u2010DFT was effective in that high levels of this drug resulted in a drastic dose\u2010dependent decrease in both cell growth and BPV\u20101 DNA replication. Lower levels of this inhibitor were found to inhibit cell growth in a dose\u2010dependent manner but had little effect on virus replication. Cells treated with 6\u2010\u2010TP, unlike \u03b1\u2010DFT, were also sensitive to a low dose of mimosine, which suggests that this inhibitor has effects beyond nucleotide starvation. These studies demonstrate that BPV\u20101 replication is enhanced by EGF, sensitive to a low dose of \u03b1\u2010DFT, and is at least partially insensitive to 6\u2010\u2010TP.

This virus has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that encodes seven structural proteins and at least one viral polymerase. Three proteins (gp2, gp3 and gp4) are considered minor structural proteins, but play important protective roles in EBOV infection. Recent evidence suggests that these three proteins (GP2, GP3 and GP4) constitute a single precursor protein, which exists as a trimer. DNA vaccines are considered to be safe and less expensive than recombinant protein-based vaccines or inactivated whole virus vaccines. In this study, we developed a novel non-virus DNA vaccine based on EBOV GP2/GP3 fusion protein (GP2/GP3F), which contains two different EBOV proteins, GP2 and GP3, and assessed the protective efficacy and mechanisms of this vaccine in a mouse model. The results showed that this DNA vaccine induced long-lasting protective immunity against the challenge not only with recombinant EBOV-GP (rGP) virus, but also with the original mouse-adapted EBOV variant strain Mayinga (MAY). This GP2/GP3F DNA vaccine effectively elicited cellular and humoral immune responses, whereas the protein alone exhibited no efficacy, due to the self-antigen and low immunogenicity, respectively. These results demonstrated that the GP2/GP3F DNA vaccine, comprising two viral antigens, could induce robust protective immunity and enhanced cellular immunity and humoral response against EBOV in mice. This vaccine could therefore be considered for an Ebola virus or other filovirus outbreaks that need to be treated before additional preparations can be made.<EOD> .\nAnatomical findings were observed in the right hemisphere of the",

To identify breast cancer-relevant therapeutic candidate genes and potential therapeutic agents, we analyzed publicly available transcriptomic data of 5,968 samples and found three important tumor suppressor genes and five oncogenes that were frequently co-expressed with highly expressed genes in tumors. We further show that the high-dimensional transcriptional data may hold therapeutic predictive value beyond what mRNA abundance and copy number alterations on their own can reveal.\n\n# Introduction\nPersonalized medicine refers to an approach to disease understanding and therapeutics targeting the patients' characteristics.

To observe this hydrophobic interaction more sensitively the micelle-water mixed system, where water was dissolved in the mixed solutions of micelles, methyltrioctylammonium chloride (MTAC), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was used. The NMR spectra of the protons of all molecules, which is a sensitive probe for the hydrogen bond between water and the hydrocarbon chain, exhibit a downfield shift and broadening in the mixed solutions of MTAC and SDS. The proton of water in the water-MTAC mixed solution, water in the water-MTAC-SDS ternary solution and methyl protons of the hydrocarbon chain in the water-MTAC-SDS ternary solution were found to be shifted to the downfield in this MTAC-SDS binary system, the hydrocarbon chain is considered to be bonded to the hydrophobic hydrate shell of MTAC. In contrast, the hydrogen bonded water shifts in response to the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrocarbon chain of SDS as well, and the hydrophobic interaction between an MTAC micelle and a SDS micelle occurs. The downfield shift seems to be the result of competition between the hydrogen bond and the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrocarbon region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<EOD> 99mTc-pyrophosphate scanning of the temporal lobe in epilepsy\nThe aim of this investigation was to clarify whether the distribution pattern of 99mTc-pyrophosphate in scintigraphy could be used to evaluate the occurrence and extent of temporal lobe sclerosis as an indirect sign of epilepsy.

To elucidate the function of the hnRNP U2 snRNP protein B' gene (also called the 3.1 B' gene), we have used an RNA-cDNA clone and a cDNA library to isolate a cDNA that hybridizes to hnRNP protein B'. This cDNA is 167 nucleotides long and corresponds to the 3' region of the mRNA. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with other snRNP proteins shows that this protein contains six homologous domains that have high similarity to the corresponding domain sequences in other snRNP proteins. Our sequence data establish that there are two alternatively spliced hnRNP B' mRNAs that differ by the inclusion of 30 nucleotides and encode closely related proteins. We determined the chromosomal location of the hnRNP B' gene by analysis of C. elegans somatic cell mutants with altered hnRNP B' RNA. The genomic clone of the hnRNP B' gene contains 8.6 kilobases and is localized in the center of LG IX. This corresponds to the same chromosome location as the uba-1 gene, which encodes a protein that is homologous to ubiquitin. This suggests that there may be a cluster of ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like genes near the center of C. elegans chromosome IX.<EOD> Effect of Dialysis Modality on Serum Carnitine Levels in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease\nObjectives: Our objective was to compare the influence of different hemodialyzer membranes on serum carnitine concentrations in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Several methods of computational analysis of TOF spectra are available, but none of them allows accurate filtering of the peaks corresponding to protein ions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe present a novel algorithm based on the MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and MALDI-TOF MS/MS spectrum, which allows identification of protein hits with high confidence and correction of errors in MOWSE scores from database search. In this study, the algorithm was applied to identify the proteins in rat brain cytosolic fraction. The algorithm was compared with three other algorithms which are used in MS/MS identification, ProteinChip, SEQUEST, and Mascot, using a number of features.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor proteins in rat brain cytosolic fraction, the algorithm can identify all proteins found by ProteinChip and SEQUEST, with accuracy rate of 95%, but can also identify a few more proteins than the two algorithms. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm can also identify peptides with higher scores than that in ProteinChip (from 12.2 to 20.4), 2.1-fold higher than in SEQUEST (from 8.05 to 17.55) and 10.47-fold higher than in Mascot (from 0.34 to 3.85), which means that it is more sensitive than these three algorithms for proteins identification. The proposed algorithm is very robust for searching of peptide peaks in both MALDI-TOF and MALDI/TOF/TOF spectra, and it has a good capacity for processing large quantity of MSA data.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe proposed method allows rapid, simple, and accurate identification of proteins and can substantially improve the efficiency of protein identification by HPLC/MS/MS. Therefore, it has great potential clinical applications in the high-throughput",

How to get a single patient-level score?\n\n## Answers:\nWe can calculate the score of the patient by summarizing the patient's eligibility score for each trial in the data set:\npatient.eligibilities_score_list = patient_trial.eligibility_score - patient.trial_id\n\n## Q3. Which is the best-ranking algorithm for a clinical trial?\n\n## Answers:\nDepending on what we want to do with the result of a clinical trial, we will need to use different ranking algorithms. In the case of the above question, the patient is being assessed for which trial they are more eligible for. A good heuristic algorithm would be an algorithm taking information from the most significant clinical trials or one that makes an effective tradeoff between information gains from each clinical trial while ensuring that every clinical trial's eligibility status for each patient is known.\nAn algorithm that works well in this case would be a two-round algorithm, where all patients are initially analyzed for a set of most eligible clinical trials in the first round and then the patients who are deemed ineligible from these clinical trials are analyzed again in the next round of the clinical trial with a larger set of remaining trials. In our case, we only analyzed 2 trials, but it was enough to find one eligible clinical trial.\nFor larger data sets, where there is a greater set of clinical trials to match all the patients to, it may be necessary to use a rounding algorithm.\nThis example used the following algorithm in python to do a simple rank ordering of patients by the number of trials they qualify for:\n\n## Trial-level eligibility = [1,0,1]\n\n## Patient.trial_eligs_scores = [",

MicroRNA plays important roles in breast development and differentiation. However, microRNA profiles in the bovine mammary epithelium before and after weaning are not known. Here, to identify miRNA that are differentially expressed during mammary gland development, we used next-generation sequencing to profile small RNA from mammary tissue samples collected from cattle at 15, 22, 38, 44, 60, 112, and 196 day of age. Results: Sequencing of small RNA from each sample identified 66 differentially expressed miRNA (30 upregulated and 36 downregulated). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed miRNA were involved in pathways that were known as contributors to mammary development and differentiation, such as apoptosis, TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Predicted targets by these differentially expressed miRNA were related to proliferation and differentiation of the mammary epithelial cells, including BASP1, AKT1, and E2F1. Conclusions: Overall, these results provide the first insight into miRNA expression in the bovine mammary epithelium before and after weaning and provide potential candidate miRNA that regulate bovine mammary differentiation.\n\n# Background\nDuring fetal development, mammary gland precursors are proliferating and undergo several crucial processes involving branching morphogenesis and differentiation [bib_ref]  Mammary gland morphogenesis, Muskavitch [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  The milk line: a review and description of mammary epithelial cell fate..., Shackelton [/bib_ref] .

Little is known about the extent to which individual physical and social environmental factors such as transportation, urban design, recreation resources, and neighborhood cohesion impact physical activity of older adults. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to address 3 research questions with respect to older adults' mobility in the community: (1) How does the level of physical activity of older adults relate to their physical and social environments? (2) What is the impact of individual characteristics (i.e., chronic disease, social support) and environmental factors of transportation, urban design, recreation resources, and social cohesion on physical activity? and (3) How do the individual and environmental characteristics of older adults interact synergistically to promote or inhibit physical activity?<EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this study was to estimate the cost of treating unintentional poisonings in the emergency department or hospitalization of a given population based on the actual cost per capita (per capita method).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA national prospective study in six Spanish hospitals was carried out on all unintentional poisonings of patients 15 years of age or older, admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department or to any hospital department, with a preliminary diagnosis of poisoning for a one-year period (from the beginning of October 1998 until the end of September 1999).

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the pathway involved in the stimulation of PGE\u2082 synthesis by PGE\u2082 in vitro. We established an osteoblastic cell line (U\u20102OS) derived from human osteosarcoma as a representative bone tissue. Under basal conditions (i.e. without exogenous arachidonic acid), U\u20102OS cells secreted negligible amounts of PGE\u2082. However, when these cells were supplied with exogenous arachidonic acid, PGE\u2082 accumulation in the cells was increased in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Exogenous PGE\u2082 stimulated the secretion of PGE\u2082 by U\u20102OS cells. This PGE\u2082\u2010stimulated PGE\u2082 production was suppressed by sulprostone,",

We have used the combination of arsenic trioxide and anagrelide to treat 33 patients with low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS. Thirty-one of 33 patients had cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of abnormal karyotypes; 14 of 18 patients who had 5q deletion had a cytogenetic response after treatment, and one patient who had partial deletion retained all of the deleted regions while achieving overall cytogenetic and clinical remissions. Cytogenetic response was related to overall response, but not to karyotypes or therapy with transfusions. Of 23 patients who did not receive transfusions, 15 achieved cytogenetic response; the response was maintained for 18 patients who did not reach 100% donor cells in the marrow after the treatment. Seven patients who had 5q deletion responded to the treatment, but none of the other patients with a cytogenetic defect other than 5q deletion did. Our results show that arsenic trioxide has activity in all hematological grades of MDS with the 5q deletion, and that it is effective even in transfusionindependent patients.<EOD> Prognostic",

Activation by NaF is inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Neither the activation by NaF nor that induced by cAMP is inhibited by the phosphorylation inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide. The effects of cAMP and NaF are additive. When pyruvate kinase is phosphorylated in vivo by rat brain protein kinase C and the reaction is assayed with labeled MgATP, 2-3 mol of 32P/mol of enzyme are phosphorylated. Phosphoamino acid analysis suggests that pyruvate kinase is phosphorylated on both the serine and threonine residues. The effect of cAMP on the phosphorylation state of pyruvate kinases from various subcellular compartments has been studied. In cytosol and mitochondria-free membrane fractions, NaF-induced phosphorylation is inhibited by cAMP. NaF does not alter the rate of phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase from the mitochondrial fraction, nor does it release phosphorylated pyruvate kinase from mitochondria. The mitochondrial pyruvate kinase is phosphorylated in situ with NaF and cAMP (or guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP)) added to the incubation. The effect of NaF and cAMP on the phosphorylation state of subcellular pools of pyruvate kinase shows that in the presence of cyclic adenosine 3\u2032:5\u2032-monophosphate 1) the NaF-induced phosphorylation of the soluble and the free-membrane pools is inhibited, 2) the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase from cytosol and membrane fraction are transferred to the mitochondria, and 3) NaF-induced phosphorylation",

Detailed perusal of the text clearly indicates that they only treated one subject under their experimental protocol and that the only conclusions the authors can draw are therefore limited to just the one patient in question. They also make the unwise assumption that IgG and IgA levels in the nasopharynx represent IgG and IgA activity in any part of the upper respiratory tract, although experimental evidence as well as knowledge of anatomic distribution would seem to contradict this (personal experience in a number of studies on Ig levels in nasal secretions in dogs indicates that Ig levels at this site may not reflect IgG activity in, or of, the sinus tract or lungs).\nThe only purpose of any clinical study must be to provide guidelines and suggestions to medical practitioners in treating patients with disease and not to establish experimental rules. This particular study by Messrs Linton and Timmis fails to provide such a contribution and may in fact be misleading. Although it is difficult to assess the effect of nasal steroids in the treatment of rhinitis and pharyngitis or as an adjunct to nasal decongestants, it would appear unlikely that Ig levels would respond to a topical steroid administered on a twice-daily regimen to one patient. The question of the effect of intranasal steroids on the Ig levels in humans, therefore, is still left unanswered and, in my opinion, the study by Linton and Timmis cannot be taken as a valid answer. For future patients with ailments involving increased Ig levels or other immune reactivity, a topical application of ster",

Recent studies have used modern phytoliths, often from herbarium collections, to reveal the botanical composition and structure of vegetation communities. However, herbarium specimens are unsuitable as phytoliths are destroyed by storage and processing conditions in herbaria. Additionally, fresh materials are necessary to understand the phytolith geochemistry in lake and river deposits over timescales of centuries or longer.

This assumption is not unreasonable if the duration of an epidemic is short. Indeed, the theory is well founded, even for large numbers of epidemics. Epidemics are often short, e.g. many epidemics are contained in the course of a single season. However, epidemics can last for years, and it is precisely these long-lasting epidemics, which cause longterm impact on the evolution of both the parasite and the host. The aim of this paper is to identify the properties of a parasite strain that facilitate its persistence outside the bounds of the epidemic process. We present an evolutionarily explicit model of a disease spreading via horizontal transmission and include epidemic extinction and re-emergence as stochastic events. We show that, for long enough epidemics, the duration of the epidemic has such a large impact on the evolution of the parasite that it must be taken into account for the assessment of evolutionary consequences.\n\n# Introduction\nThere is increasing evidence that pathogens have the potential to react to environmental selection pressure imposed by co-evolutionary interactions with their hosts [bib_ref]  Mechanisms of Adaptive Synergistic Evolution, Olson-Manning [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  Inverse ecology: inferring adaptive evolution from an ecological context, Hindrikson [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  Evolutionary analysis of the dynamics of viral epidemics, Rouzine [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the real world: Interactions between genetic, matrix, and..., Leimar [/bib_ref]  [bib_ref]  Environmental stress and the evolution of sex: what can we learn from..., Hurst [/bib_ref] .

The investigation was carried out in accordance with a double-blind design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two equal groups, by their individual chronological ages. Both training interventions lasted eight weeks and each included five training sessions a week. In basketball work (BW) group, sessions were organized as standard basketball games training. In ball drill (BD) group, sessions included a standard combination of ball-handling drills. A series of horizontal counter movements (CMJ), standing long jump (SLJ) and squat jump (SJ) tests were carried out to determine the athletic abilities of participants. Testing was done before beginning and at the end of the training intervention.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults of the CMJ, SLJ and SJ tests show that after training, the BW group had larger gains in SJ height (p=<0.05) and the BD group had larger gains in CMJ height (p=<0.05). The changes in body height and body weight and the difference between pre-test and post-test values were similar in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study suggest that during the competitive period of the season different training programmes affect young male basketball players' motor characteristics. It is worth noting that when a combination of specific content and technique is present in the exercises, it may provide additional improvements in players' physical abilities.<EOD>",

However, the treatment of recurrent high-risk glioblastoma is challenging and still a matter of debate. Currently no standard treatment modality exists for this problem. Here we present a case of high-risk diffuse glioblastoma with severe contrast enhancement that was refractory to chemotherapy and progression-free during three months after stereotactic radiotherapy. The patient developed multicentric recurrent lesions in the area of the initially irradiated lesion and was treated with gamma knife stereotactic radiotherapy and concomitantly received temozolomide chemotherapy. One month later the lesions enlarged and had to be surgically removed. The histopathological examination revealed a recurrent high-risk diffuse glioblastoma. The initial lesion, still unresectable, showed persistent contrast enhancement with significant decrease in density. The presented case underlines that even if the imaging-based response to stereotactic radiotherapy is good, multicentric recurrence can occur with a progressively enlarged region showing contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n# Introduction\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common cause of malignant brain tumors. Despite surgical resection, multidisciplinary therapy including radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy, the majority of patients develop a further intracranial progression of the disease. There are only few reports of radiotherapy for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM) showing favorable outcomes. However, radiotherapy for recurrent high-risk GBM is still debatable and treatment can only be discussed under different aspects. Here we present a case of high risk diffuse GBM treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) showing tumor response and stability; later the recurrent lesions had to be surgically removed. However, progression of the diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma was still intact and presented a challenge",

Previous studies found that some patients with gliomas had abnormal pupil sizes in specific situations. We hypothesized that glioma patients would show altered pupil sizes in VR compared with controls, and that this relationship would depend on whether they experience more derealization. Twenty-five patients with treated gliomas and 30 healthy controls completed a VR task that measured their pupil sizes. Patients reported their level of derealization and presence. Patients had larger pupil dilation in VR than did controls, and this pupil dilation was related to heightened feelings of derealization experienced in VR. Patients who reported greater derealization had larger pupils during VR. This relationship was not significant after controlling for variance explained by age, sex, or type of VR experience. This study adds to the growing body of literature showing that glioma influences the pupil-size response to VR.<EOD> Identifying critical amino acid residues of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase responsible for initiating GalNAc transfer to polypeptide backbone.\nUDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pp-GalNAc-T) catalyzes the first step in mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis in a transfer reaction from UDP-GalNAc to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in the substrate polypeptide. One of the most common types of mucin-type O-glycan on blood group glycosyltransferase is the H-type with GalNAc residue as a common carrier moiety. The GalNAc is mainly added to serine residues, and 3-O-sulfation is the most common modification. Based on the tertiary structure of Galactoside 2 alpha-Galactosyltransferase, it was possible to predict the position of amino acid residues that are critical for substrate recognition.

This study was designed to clarify the clinical and demographic characteristics of NGU patients with and without gonococcal infection. The results showed that the following characteristics were significantly more common in the gonococcal infection group than in the non-gonococcal infection group: (1) younger patients ( < 20 yrs.) were more prevalent, (2) the rates of fever (52.8%-13.4%), purulent discharge (75.5%-36.6%) and urethral pain (64.6%-26. 1%) were significantly higher, and (3) the interval between urethritis onset and treatment was shorter (3 days-7days, 2 weeks). Gonococcal infection occurred more often in the late period of urethritis in our NGU patients. The NGU patients with gonococcal infection may have earlier stages of Urethritis. This finding might account for the higher proportion of symptomatic patients found in this group. Gonococcal infection may be a high risk factor for NGU. The authors concluded that this group of NGU patients required more aggressive treatment and that screening for gonococci should be carried out at the initial visit.<EOD> An Analysis of the Factors Contributing to a Large International Variation in Peritoneal Dialysis Prevalence Rates.\nBACKGROUND\nThe number of prevalent peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is a global measure of the PD modality's popularity.

One is to react against parasitic organisms, bacteria, viruses and other \u2018non-self\u2019 organisms. Its second task is to eliminate the \u2018non-self\u2019 elements formed within the body over the course of life, and in particular the transformed cells which can give rise to benign tumours and to malignant growths and cancers, which often have a fatal result. The two processes, the elimination of non-self organisms and the elimination of transformed cells, are normally carried out by separate and specific parts of the immune system. This is most clear in relation to parasites in animals and humans, and in recent reviews the development of the humoral and cellular immune responses to parasites and the roles played by antibodies and lymphocytes in the elimination of these organisms has been described.26 The problem of the immune response to tumours is different in that no specific part of the immune system is primarily responsible for eliminating them because of their transformation status. Indeed, some forms of tumour grow as a result of immune reactions which seek to eliminate them, and this has been the basis of a number of therapeutic approaches to treatment. Because of these complex relationships of the immune system to tumours, it is not possible to define in all cases whether the immune system is inhibitory or stimulatory to tumours, and whether the immune cells and immune responses can be used to assist the patient in his fight against cancer.<EOD> A study of prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serological markers in patients attending an orthopaedic department in eastern India.\nAIM\nOrthopaedic surgeons are exposed to blood and blood-contaminated fluids while attending to the patient.

In this study, DeepSINA, a novel deep learning-based model, was constructed to predict dysfunctional lncRNAs from canine whole genome sequences. The study was conducted from two aspects: the whole canine genome sequence data were processed by the deep learning neural network to extract the lncRNA-specific sequence features, and then the multi-layer perceptron was used to classify lncRNAs and mRNAs by combining different features. We extracted the lncRNA sequence features from the processed data by CNN. In addition, according to the results of sequence length and ORF, as well as the location of lncRNAs on the genome, two kinds of sequence features, viz. sequence (S) and location (L), were constructed, and then combined with traditional sequence features, viz. GC content (G), codon bias information (CBI), and codon bias positioning information (CBPI), to form the final feature set for model training (SGCLCBI).

It also means that you don't change your decision during the trial, but rather assess the same set of patients at similar time points. We will be using it in the second part of the trial, to assess all the notes we will collect during the trial with it.\n\n### Part 1: Assess patient notes by Trial-level eligibility\nPlease complete Part 1 of the questionnaire in the following manner:\n\n1. Take the first patient note from the patient list and look at the patient information sheet on the left side of the screen to collect the relevant details: gender, age, height, weight, smoking status, and whether the patient is eligible for this study.\n2. Enter the assessment result to the line `Trial-level eligibility: 0,` if the patient is eligible, or enter `Trial-level eligibility: 1`, if the patient is ineligible.\n3. Now, enter the reason of the ineligibility, if you have identified any, into the following line: `Triallevel reason for trial ineligibility: `.\n\n### Part 2: Please do the same for the remaining notes\n\nThe rest of the patient notes on the screen can be assessed by following Part 1. However, instead of clicking to the line `Trial-level eligibility: 0` or `Trial-level eligibility: 1`, you will enter the line `Trial-level eligibility: ` and then will enter the number of trial-level result for the given patient (0, 1 or 2).\n\n###",

These factors all signal through the insulin-like growth factor receptor to exert a multitude of effects on the neuroregenerative and cellular survival, neuronal differentiation and axonal regeneration. Neuronal survival is in close relation to neurotrophic factor gene expression. Since growth hormone shares the same receptor as these neurotrophic factors and is important in neuronal survival, the question arises, whether it is possible to modulate neurotrophic factor secretion by growth hormone or vice versa. The potential interactions of growth hormone and neurotrophic factors are reviewed here in particular with respect to their release machinery, including molecular interactions with the insulin-like growth factor receptor, receptor kinases, scaffold proteins and calcium/calcium-related signaling. This knowledge could be useful regarding potential therapies for various neurodegenerative diseases if it were possible to regulate or modulate the release of or the interactions of the involved growth factors.<EOD> A novel genetic marker of the ALDH2 gene for predictive diagnosis in patients with ischemic stroke.\nIschemic stroke (IS) is the most common cerebrovascular disease in many countries.

These microbes persist for a long period of time; they are present from early pregnancy, and they tend to be present for the bulk of the pregnancy. They are detectable in blood samples obtained from women, and they are culturable on standard bacteriological media. While they are most often detected in women who have had previous miscarriage or uterine infection, approximately a quarter of women who have not experienced these conditions also have uterine microbes which are culturable; they are not known to be associated with uterine infection. This is the first paper to describe and establish a high prevalence for the human intrauterine microbiota. We present data which suggests that these microbes have the potential to promote pregnancy, and that their detection in blood of a childbearing-age woman in adulthood could signal reproductive complications. There is a growing body of work that indicates that the uterine tract contains bacteria. These microbes have a significant role in the pathogenesis of some uterine diseases, including infection, and they have a role in the pathogenesis of preterm delivery in association with an ascending vaginal microbial composition (termed the vagino-uterine microbial continuum). This study examines the prevalence of the human intrauterine microbiota in samples collected at 17\u201325 wk of gestation from 212",

The authors present a case report of treating a facial skin area of approximately 10 cm in a 45 kg adult male that showed signs of infection and necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA 41\u2010year\u2010old male with a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes type I mellitus for 20 years came in to the authors' plastic surgery practice presenting a large ulcer on the right half of his face, along with periorbital and right ear edema and right upper eyelid swelling. The patient was treated with open washouts and oral ciprofloxacin until the wound reached a healthier status and was ready for grafting. The wound was reconstructed with autologous meshed bilateral rectus abdominis fascia flap with split\u2010thickness skin graft. He was discharged home on the fifth day postoperatively where he received home health to administer the dressings with hyperbaric oxygen therapy two to three times per week for 30\u2003min per session. The flap maintained its integrity until the day of discharge (postoperative day 6). The patient developed necrotizing skin graft overlying the surgical bed at the distal end of the rectus abdominis fascia flap. He underwent repeated debridement and dressing care. During the postoperative course, the patient had recurrent wound infection and cellulitis, requiring additional debridement with further skin grafting. During the final debridement, the implant drainage tube became exposed, causing infection at its exit site. The exposed implant was removed, and the patient eventually recovered uneventfully and was discharged home.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFacial skin defect reconstruction is challenging especially when the diabetes is uncontrolled.

Contractions were recorded in isolated uterine arteries from an ovariectomized pseudopregnant sheep (ovary-implanted with an estrogen-progesterone biphasic pellet or, in the case of the cyclic sheep, a single implant of progesterone) during incubation of the strips with GnRH. In all cases uterine artery strips contracted in response to GnRH with maximal effects occurring at concentrations greater than 5 x 10(-11) M (0.0057 nM; P less than 0.001). In contrast, myometrial strips from both pseudopregnant and cyclic sheep did not contract in response to similar GnRH concentrations. In both pseudopregnant and cyclic sheep, however, GnRH was a potent relaxant of preincubated uterine vasculature strips obtained from the time of the positive LH surge (P less than 0.001). Myometrial strips, on the other hand, appeared to be less responsive to relaxation (P less than 0.05). In support of earlier studies and in contrast to the non-pregnant sheep, relaxant responses to GnRH in the pregnant sheep were dependent upon the presence of prostaglandin synthesis. Thus relaxation in response to GnRH was not seen in strips of pregnant sheep treated with indomethacin (10 microM; P less than 0.0001) but was seen in the control tissue.

For the cases of initial treatment, the combination treatment of surgery and external radiation therapy is effective, but for the cases who are unfit for the surgery and external radiation therapy, hormone therapy is more effective than radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The active surveillance without any treatment is possible in many of the patients with prostate cancer. As for the follow-up and treatment, the risk group of prostate cancer is important. According to the risk group proposed by D' Amico, the treatments are different. There are the risk group of the prostate cancer. The clinical stage of pro",

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of a Spanish-language video to impact the screening discussion and understanding about the PSA test and its implication for cancer prevention among Hispanics.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHispanic men were randomly assigned to either a baseline group that received usual care or a video experimental group. There were 104 participants in each group. The first two questions asked in the baseline and the questionnaires were administered to assess the knowledge about prostate cancer and its screening test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in the video experimental group were significantly more likely to feel informed and prepared to have the initial screening conversation with the urologist or primary care provider. However, both groups reported low knowledge scores in information about prostate cancer screening. The video educational group was no better at interpreting the PSA screening test results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA screening decision intervention that was specifically designed for Hispanic men did not result in greater knowledge about prostate cancer screening test. Our results emphasizes the importance of designing interventions to address the health literacy needs of target population.<EOD> Rigorously measured surface tensions as a means of characterizing the accuracy of surface properties from molecular simulations.\nWe quantify the relationship between surface tension and molecular surface properties, particularly the total number of hydrogen bonds and average liquid structure of three types of molecule (Lennard-Jones fluids, Cao and Barker liquids, and Coulombic ions). The surface tension of fluids has been determined experimentally using the Taylor drop method (Gray et al.) for all but the Coulombic systems. The surface tension in the Coulombic systems were obtained through the Widom scaling law. The values of the Coulombic surface tension have been compared to theoretical predictions from both a thermodynamical analysis and an analysis of the excess surface charge and excess dipole.

Two-step therapy was proposed as an alternative approach, with the extraction of orthodontically \"easy\" teeth or unilateral movement and/or extraction of the same tooth on the opposite side.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effect of two-step orthodontics on the reduction of orthodontic movements and the prevention of root resorption, marginal bone loss, and gingival recessions.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe performed a systematic search in 13 electronic databases from inception to November 2020. Two review authors independently reviewed the electronic search results. After the selection process, we compared the changes in the outcome measures between two-step orthodontics and conventional therapy. A random model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe literature search retrieved 572 records of which 10 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Two-step therapy allowed a slight increase in movements (in maxillary teeth) and slight decrease in movements (in the mandibular teeth), whereas the side effects occurred more frequently with two-step therapy. We found no statistically significant differences between groups in all analyzed parameters, with few exceptions.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe main limitations are the presence of heterogeneity and a limited number of studies analyzed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is no support to indicate that there is a clinical advantage of applying two-step, and there are no scientific evidences to suggest that two-step orthodontics prevented root resorption, marginal bone loss, and gingival recessions.

Its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide. The current management of acute pancreatitis is mostly supportive-notably fluid and electrolyte rehydration and pain control-but more targeted pharmacotherapy against the disease is needed. However, there are few pharmacological targets available for treatment of acute pancreatitis nowadays. Therefore, it is imperative to discover new therapeutic targets for the development of disease-attenuating drugs. In this study, we focused on two intracellular proteins (nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (Nm23-H1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (MAPK14)) important in regulating pancreatic function and which are known to be dysregulated in AP. The goal of our study was to predict if the Nm23-H1 and MAPK14 would gain membrane localization during the early stages of caerulein-induced AP in rats. First, the proteins of interest were expressed in HEK293T cell line. Based on the predictions obtained from the ProMembrane server, the proteins were visualized with the membrane tracker using confocal microscopy. The results indicated that both proteins localized on the cell membrane even without the exposure to caerulein. By contrast, the confocal results showed that these proteins remain cytoplasmic during the early stage of AP, suggesting that the caeruelin/Ca(2+) signal might not induce recruitment of the membrane proteins during the acute phase of AP.<EOD> A clinical and imaging investigation of bone erosions in temporomandibular joint disorder.\nBACKGROUND\nDespite several studies reporting a strong association between bone erosions and temporomandibular joint (",

However, the effects of the insecticides on other arthropod species have rarely been considered. We examined the effects of two insecticides (\u03bb-cyhalothrin and spirodiclofen), a plant growth regulator (aminocarb), and a nontoxic compound, diethylene glycol, on the abundance of Thrips obscuratus Crawford (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), its natural enemy, Entomobrya tarsalis Curtis (Collembola: Entomobryidae), and a pseudoscorpion (Chelicerata: Pseudoscorpionidae) in Kodiak Island, Japan. The density of adult thrips, Ent. tarsalis, and the pseudoscorpion was measured in 150-cm2 leaf samples in an orchard at four times in a row (in March, May, September (2 times), and November). A \u03bb-cyhalothrin treatment (a commercial product \u2018Ambush\u2019) reduced pest and natural enemy populations in the early to mid-summer; spirodiclofen was highly toxic to Ent. tarsalis all throughout the year. In the later season, \u03bb-cyhalothrin, spirodiclofen, and the plant growth regulator significantly reduced the adult and nymph density of thrip; the plant growth regulator also decreased the population of natural enemies. Conversely, aminocarb, a plant growth regulator, did not affect thrips in mid-summer. Our data revealed that the population of insecticide susceptible insects and the population of natural enemies were affected by agricultural insecticides.<EOD> Role of A20 ubiquitin hydrolase in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis pathogen",

Unfortunately, the immune status of those patients frequently limits this therapeutic option, so other strategies are urgently required, which can reactivate the cellular responses of these patients. To overcome this limitation, immune cells can be reactivated using several different strategies. For instance, to reactivate T cells to fight cancers or pathogenic infections, cancer/virus-specific artificial T-cell receptors (TCRs)or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can be used, with both of them enhancing the function of T lymphocytes. In parallel, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can also enhance T-cell responses, especially in the case of patients that have hematological or solid cancers, and they can also generate lymphocyte progenitor cells from CD34 + stem cells.

In this group there were 7 (41.2%) foetuses who died after cord clamping. The overall pulmonary hypoplasia was 57.8% and it was 66.7% in patients who did not receive ANC. There was no association between ANC and survival of the foetuses or between ANC and the occurrence of pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of ANC was not associated with an increase in survival or a decrease in the frequency of pulmonary hypoplasia, which supports other studies that have shown no effect.<EOD> Discharge planning.

Serum level of total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (AST) and aminotransferase (ALT), TNF-\u03b1 and expression of NF-\u03baB in liver were detected 24 h and 48 h after ALF induction. Serum levels of TBIL and AST/ALT were evaluated 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after treatment of IGF-1. Pathological examination of the liver, the expression of HSP-70 and iNOS and apoptosis rate of liver were determined 48 h after ALF induction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 24 h and 48 h after treatment of IGF-1 in rats with ALF, serum level of TBIL was decreased by 44.1% and 48.8% respectively , AST and ALT were reduced by 30.5% and 15.7% respectively , TNF-\u03b1 decreased by 56.4% and 25.5% respectively and expression of NF-\u03baB was decreased by 36.7% and 55.5% respectively (P0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that IGF-1 could decrease the expression of NF-\u03baB, iNOS and HSP-70 at 48 h(P<0.05). The hepatocellular apoptosis rate was found to be 51.7%, 47.1% and 38.5% respectively in the ALF group, the I",

The antibiotic TC showed a particular adherence to Ti implant, even more than chloramphenicol (CB) and penicillin. PA was performed using a light emitting diode (LED) and it was evaluated by the use of fluorescence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Ti osteocompatibility was evaluated by histopathological and immunohistochemical assays of bone formation and gene expression. Fluorescence intensity was evaluated by confocal microscopy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression of genes involved in bone healing was similar for Ti and TC (Ti: 2.0, TC: 1.6) or TC (Ti: 1.6, TC: 1.8) treated samples. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that PA of TC was more intense than PA of CB or PA of penicillin. Also, fluorescence was more intense in TC treated samples than in Ti only or TC only treated samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt was possible to induce osseointegration in the presence of an antibiotic molecule due to the interaction of that with Ti implant.<EOD> The effect of ciprofloxacin and metaplax on the biochemical and molecular changes of the liver and kidney of diabetic rats\n\nBackground: Diabetes mellitus may lead to different complications including diabetic hepatitis and nephrotoxicity.

First, very small numbers of SIDS cases are available for study, and the majority of all such studies have been based on questionnaires, so that data must be analyzed by indirect techniques. Perhaps most important, however, is the failure to distinguish clearly between prenatal risk factors to be found in maternal history and prenatal risk factors to be discovered in ultrasonographic (US) examinations, and perinatal risk factors (including postnatal factors) contributing in some manner to SIDS. A recent study of perinatal risk factors for SIDS, 1 including 259 SIDS cases and 642 control infants, indicates that an increased frequency of an elevated pH of the placenta among live control infants with no history of SIDS and high-risk siblings may be associated with an increased death rate from SIDS. Also of interest in the study was the observation that the frequency of a high umbilical pH of greater than 7.50<EOD> A novel, integrated pipeline for the alignment and variant calling of multiple whole genome sequencing samples on the same chromosome from cancer patients\nMotivation\nThe analysis of hundreds of whole genome sequences (WGS) and whole exome sequences (WES) is not a straightforward process. It remains an open challenge because of the large number of samples (often N200) and the large number of genomic positions of interest (>5\u00d7106). However, the analysis typically requires the alignment of multiple samples to a single reference genome, or even one sample for WGS data. Therefore, the data structures and algorithms have to be sufficiently designed to handle large scale alignments and variant calling. Another challenge is that the number of false positives in the variant calling step is unknown, especially when dealing with multiple samples at once. This issue further comp",

Honeybee colonies were first successfully established under laboratory conditions in temperate regions in France by MURET (1960) and in the tropics by MARTIN (1963). These techniques were utilized then by several bee researchers in different temperate and tropical regions. BRAZ (1970) had good success in obtaining bee colonies from nuclei of swarming colonies, using 1-hole hive boxes with a comb foundation. MISHRO (1974) used a simpler procedure by creating new colonies by placing a comb in a cardboard box, which then was covered to give a shaded area in which only a few bees were able to obtain food. RIZZUTTI & AZEVEDO (1978) and PIZY (1969), using the same technique, obtained queenless and queenright colonies. The latter succeeded in producing new colonies using the method described by POLI AND PEREIRA in the laboratory of the Agronomy School at Rio de Janeiro. These colonies were formed with queenless drone honeybee nuclei, using small combs (invented at the School of Agronomy and Forest from UFV). After four months we had 400 colonies of adults originated from young pupae. In the same paper PEIXOTO & RATI (1975) succeeded in establishing colonies with honeybee queenless honeybee drone nuclei in 9 of 350 colonies which were analyzed. These results encouraged bee researchers to increase methods for getting queenless colonies; this success did not depend upon colonies having sufficient numbers of young pupae. For obtaining nuclei, the honey bee hives should have at least 40% young pupae, otherwise such small nuclei were not accepted as sources of",

To determine whether endothelial cells exposed to methylprednisolone alter the tissue factor pathway, we evaluated neutrophil adherence to HUVEC monolayers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHUVEC monolayers were exposed to methylprednisolone for 6 hr. Urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), plasminogen, human neutrophils with or without anti-CD11b-coupled magnetic microbeads, and tissue plasminogen activator were added for an additional 30 min. Neutrophil adhesion was evaluated by quantifying the fluorescence of adhered neutrophils incubated with fluorescein diacetate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith a decrease in u-PA antigen levels in methylprednisolone-preconditioned HUVECs, u-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation in HUVEC culture medium was significantly decreased.

The SD of the clinical trial group is 16.1 and the SD of the patient group is 17.3.

The evidence base for surgery is extremely poor. There are few randomised studies or prospective observational studies, although there are three prospective non-randomised studies of patients undergoing endoscopic therapy and randomised trials of surgery versus gastrectomy for non-malignant oesophageal disease. Most available studies are retrospective. The largest study is the MRC/EORTC trial of surgery versus gastrectomy for non-malignant oesophageal disease (n = 553) which suggests that oesophagectomy may be more effective than gastric surgery and there is evidence of improved survival in those patients who undergo resection of the carcinoma rather than palliation or no surgery. In another study the 5-year survival rate was 41% after surgery for Barre's ulcer compared with 23% after surgery for early carcinoma of the lower oesophagus. The follow up in both groups was extremely poor and other treatments such as surgical palliation were not taken into account. There is one report which questions whether subtotal gastrectomy may be as effective as oesophagectomy. The authors found that subtotal gastrectomy was more complicated, led to increased complication rates and poorer quality of life and that the long term outcomes (notably relapse and survival) were poorer than in the group with oesophagectomy. They did not have a control group and the patients' overall survival with subtotal gastrectomy was poor (3% at 5 years). Further evidence suggests that the results after subtotal gastrectomy are better than those after oesophagectomy. The evidence as a whole is weak and it is impossible to draw any general conclusions about the role of surgery. No randomised",

In this paper, we reassess the role of m1 receptors (m1Rs) in AD by generating transgenic mice that overexpress the Swedish mutant form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP). We found that there is no major change in m1R number (receptor density) in either the anterior part or the posterior part of the cortex of these transgenic animals at any stage of the disease process. We then went on to characterize the behavioral consequences of the altered cholinergic system in both wild-type and APP mice. We found that in addition to the deficits in spatial learning, as measured by the Morris water maze, APP mice had deficits in several other learning and memory paradigms, including the Morris swim pool, novel object recognition, and contextual and cued fear conditioning tasks. Interestingly, the memory impairments were not apparent during early life and were apparent primarily in middle age for the spatial discrimination/pattern separation task, in which wild-type mice demonstrate significant memory deficit by age 18 months and APP mice show deficits at even earlier ages. The transgene, however, did not alter normal mice's performance in any of the behavioral tasks. The in vivo behavioral results were supported by in vitro electrophysiological recordings from the brain slices of wild-type mice aged 12-15 months and APP mice aged 15-16 months. These results are consistent with a deficit in plasticity which appears to correlate with the onset of cognitive impairment.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of AKI on outcomes in HHF patients.\n\n\nMethod\nThe prospective study recruited 692 adults hospitalized for HHF at a tertiary cardiology center. Patients were assigned to two groups according to the AKI presence (AKI versus non-AKI). Multivariate association of AKI with 30- and 180-day, as well as long-term outcomes was performed.\n\n\nResults\nOut of the 692 patients included, AKI was noted in 286 (41.2%) patients. AKI was a significant predictor of 30-day (adjusted hazards ratio (HR) 2.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-3.00) and long-term (adjusted HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.36-3.55) mortality.

Like other members of the neonicotinoids it is a potent cholinergic agonist, targeting the same mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as nicotine (the acetamidine nitrogen, for example, is found in the structure of nicotine). It is, therefore, used in insecticide formulations that kill nerve-cell-bearing insects, such as those affecting beekeeping. It bears some resemblance to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, such as nicotine and chlorpyrifos.\nUnlike neurotoxic organophosphorus insecticides, acetamiprid, neonicotinoids and other related systemics have a \"neuroprotective\" effect and do not cause acute toxic effects in humans, nor do they bioaccumulate in the environment.\nSince it is systemic the insecticide kills insects by contact with body sites including nectaries, honeydew and other honey stores that are used as food by ants. They are applied to vegetation that grow close to food sources such as hives. The insecticidal spray form targets insect foraging.\n\n# Uses\nLike all nicotinic insecticides, acetamiprid is directed at insects (including some social species, such as Hymenoptera) rather than mammalian animals. It is commonly used in horticulture (particularly on flowers) for control of sucking insects (e.g. aphids) and non-sucking insects (e.g. whiteflies), as well as mites, molluscs (slugs), and other chewing insects (e.g. beetles) feeding on the foliage.  The insecticide is also useful against plant lice, psyllids, cochineal mites, vine mealybugs, red spider mites, and vine rupter thrips.\nHowever, acet",

The current systematic review aimed to examine differences in sleep-wake behavior of children with and without developmental disorders (DD) and to describe sleep architecture. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched in March 2020 using stringent inclusion criteria and reference checks. Two independent authors analyzed the eligibility of selected studies. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were reviewed. Studies reported insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, night awakenings, and/or low sleep efficiency in the child- with-DD sample; however, there was inconsistency in sleep-wake characteristics in the DD sample. Sleep architecture was reported in a limited number of studies that showed altered proportion of stages N1 and REM sleep in the DD sample. CONCLUSIONS: Research on sleep is an essential area of interest for children with DD because sleep is recognized as a modulator for cognition and behavior, and because the prevalence of sleep problems among this group of children is higher than in typically developing children.<EOD> The role of phytocompounds in the green synthesis of biocompatible gold nanoparticles with possible antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties\nGold NPs were synthesized in situ in the presence of aqueous extracts of herbal medicinal plants including Rosa canina, Rosmarinus officinalis, Matricaria chamomilla, Satureja hortensis, Allium sativum, and Coriandrum sativum using the reducing agent extracts with or without a bio-stabilizer (starch) to be used for the antimicrobial activity test.

        "output": "---\n\n## Concept: Inheritance & Polymorphism\nThe inheritance of individual human genes varies. One gene of a pair \u2014 the heterozygote \u2014 may be the same as the normal gene. Or it may be a gene that has been modified. The modified gene may differ in one small way, producing a different amino acid, glycosylate the same amino acid, or attach a different phosphate group to the amino acid. Any change in the coding region of a gene, including frameshift mutations, splice site mutation, insertion and deletion mutation, and duplication or deletion of gene sequences leads to a different amino acid chain translation than the normal gene. This gene modification causes a protein product with a different amino acid composition (or sequence) to be produced \u2014 the mutant or variant protein. These variants can be divided into two types. One is single nucleotide polymorphism, a difference in a single base; this type of polymorphism is very rare. One is a difference of 3-base or larger, known as frame-shift or nonsense polymorphism. The other types of polymorphisms are insertion and deletion polymorphisms. \nA polymorphic gene is one whose two different forms are inherited separately by different individuals within a population, and one form (genotype) has a higher frequency than the other form (minor genotype). A polymorphic gene is different to a mutated gene, which was generated by spontaneous mutation (point mutation or deletion/insertion mutation). The term has been used since the 1970s, and was first introduced by population geneticist Richard Lewontin. Polymorphic genes are thought to be subject to natural selection and gene flow.\nFor any given polymorphic gene, all three genotypes (one major, one minor, and the heterozygote) will usually be found in a population, and the three genotypes",

The degree of fibrosis varies and depends on both inflammation itself and factors of the extracellular environment of the liver, in particular transforming growth factor-\u03b2 which stimulates fibroplasia. For the assessment of hepatic fibrosis, most clinicians currently perform liver biopsy that still remains the gold standard (2).

This opens a very similar dialog window as with a regular XML file. You can export just the current file or select multiple files and export a text file containing all of them. You can also specify a name for the text file. Here as well, the file type can be chosen among different possibilities, notably for the HTML format, or CSV or XSL. These are the only options offered for text output. By default, a folder where the exported file will be stored is created automatically. Here, you have to create a folder on your disk manually in order to avoid saving the file in the downloads folder.\n\n### What do you need to export the file?\nYou do not need to export a file before doing any testing. Testing is usually done using the Test button, which opens a dialog window allowing you to open several files and run all the trial actions on these files. The Test button is not available when you are working with single files.\nExporting a file can be useful in some situations:\n- When your file contains information about a test trial (using the Test button)\n- When you want to send information to someone else\n- When you want to send this file to someone who does not have XSPLIT. The file can be read anywhere with another text editor and the XSL.\n<EOD> .\nThe effect of adrenergic substances and beta-blockers on proliferation of the bovine aortic endothelial cells was studied in vitro.

Subjects were given pretests to assess their ability to perform the procedures and apply relevant clinical knowledge to the patient case scenarios presented. They then had the opportunity to perform procedures and apply these clinical skills in simulated emergency situations. Scores on the pretest and posttests were compared. Knowledge testing revealed significant gains between the pre- and posttests of the study, with a mean increase in score of 4.5 of a possible 25 points. The residents significantly improved their ability to perform two prehospital airway management procedures with a mean score of 6.62 of a possible 10 points on the airway performance score. They were significantly better in their ability to apply relevant clinical knowledge to the case scenario presented rather than to the procedure performed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough emergency-medicine residents improved their performance of airway management and their ability to apply relevant clinical knowledge in prehospital settings, they did not fully demonstrate their ability to integrate these skills. Adequate training of emergency-medicine residents in prehospital airway management and critical care medicine is necessary.<EOD> Preliminary report on a new drug.\nTricin (Tridinol, TDC) was selected by the Division of Pharmacodynamics because (1) of the large range and frequency of doses used, (2) the fact that its use is world-wide, and (3) because of its reported beneficial effects on patients",

The study was conducted over 3 months in one medical center with primary healthcare in a region in northern Serbia. The study included 10,000 patients. Standardized questionnaires were used, with a specific questionnaire for the evaluation of clinical conditions along with sociodemographic parameters. The results showed that the prevalence of mental disorders was lower than the international mean values in the same age group. It represents a total of approximately 6% of the tested population, with the highest prevalence among females (11.4%) and patients of the highest age categories. The prevalence of these disorders among patients who attended a private health center was twice as much (12.9%; p < 0.05) as that among patients who attended a public health center. The most common psychiatric disorder was depression, followed by anxiety and sleeping disorder. The majority of patients who had such disorders were offered antidepressants in higher doses and longer treatment, although more than one-half of all patients had lower doses. The results of this study showed that the prevalence of mental disorders was higher than the international average. There was also a tendency for a higher prevalence of mental disorders to be more common in private care.

To see the data stored in each individual string, you can click on an array element and see its index like this:\n\n    jupyter_terminate: 4095 \n\nThis prints out a row of the data, so you can see that the top of a new line is the index for an item of an array. So we must print the string which corresponds to row four, which corresponds to index 11. When you want to iterate through the data that has been loaded from a file, you need to use the array notation. You can see that using the array notation is the same as using the index notation.

Among these viruses, BQCV was most prevalent and was detected nearly in all the bee samples investigated (97.7%), followed by PLV (84.48%), SBV (64.6%), DWV (62.64%), CBPV (59.79%), ABPV (49.80%), and IAPV (20.70%). The mixed infection by more than one virus was found in 67.50% of all bees, with the most common combination of viruses being BQCV and IAPV (33.06%) followed by BQCV and DWV (13.35%). This is the first investigation from India that detected the presence of some of the viruses identified in the present study. The present study suggests that these viruses are widespread across the country and are highly pathogenic. This could have a far-reaching impact on the honey ecosystem because even healthy colonies might be potential sources of contagious viruses transmitted to human consumers, leading to honey-related allergic reactions.<EOD> .\nA case of a traumatic rupture of the ectatic right coronary artery is reported.

We recently demonstrated that BADSMC-1 cells possess TPA esterase, a cellular phorbol ester degrading enzyme.

All agree that pulmonary tuberculosis is uncommon in persons with diabetes of more than 10 years' duration, but a survey in this country is at present being carried out to test, in greater detail, this relative freedom from pulmonary tuberculosis during the period of incipient diabetes and over the longer period of established diabetes.The observation has been made repeatedly, however, that the incidence of tuberculin sensitivity is lower in young persons with diabetes of short duration and in adults with diabetes lasting 15 years or more.

Electrophysiological studies were performed using extracellular recordings in anaesthetized rats 28 days after ovariectomy (n = 6), compared with a control group of intact animals (n = 5). Rats were implanted bilaterally with a guide cannula above the anterior commissure for the intra-hypothalamic injection (1 microlitre) of bicuculline. Bicuculline was injected unilaterally in different animals. Bicuculline injection induced excitation that was characterized by increased firing rate of vasopressinergic and/or corticotrophin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive neurones and an increase in the frequency of the electrically evoked population discharges of the median eminence. A pronounced long-lasting suppression of the electrically evoked response in the median eminence was observed after injection of bicuculline in the left, but not in the right, supraoptic nucleus in intact rats. In contrast, bilateral injection of bicuculline produced a long-lasting excitation, with a large increase of the amplitude of the population discharges in the median eminence, 28 days after bilateral ovariectomy. The data show that changes in the physiological properties of the supraoptic nucleus, produced by ovariectomy, cause a dysreg",

To the best of our knowledge, only two previous cases of neuropathy associated with LCH have been published in the literature. We report a child with multisystem LCH presenting with peripheral neuropathy as the first symptom.Case Presentation: A 2-year-old girl was presented with peripheral neuropathy, dullness of consciousness, and involuntary movement after she received one year of chemotherapy for LCH. Nerve conduction studies revealed abnormalities in lower limbs. Motor evoked potentials recorded from lower limbs revealed conduction block and conduction slowing. Radiography, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and single phosphorus spectroscopy showed no abnormalities. After administration of intermittent intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, the patient's symptoms improved and her peripheral nerve conduction velocity recovered partially. After the patient ceased IVIG treatment for three months, her neurological symptoms exacerbated along with reduction of the nerve conduction velocity. After re-initiation of IVIG treatment the patient's symptoms improved and nerve conduction velocity recovered again.Discussion and Conclusion: We conclude that the peripheral neuropathy in our case was likely caused by acute inflammation of demyelinated nerve fibers and was improved by IVIG infusion.\n\n# Background\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, disorder characterized by histological features of infiltration with Langerhans cells [bib_ref]  Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Gandemer [/bib_ref] .

To illustrate the use of the command, here we demonstrate the following code section: \nExercise 3. `clinical trials: a practical guide, 2nd ed. by D. arnold and A. arnold`\nHere is the patient note:\nA 27-year-old male with a history of a motor vehicle accident complicated by a burst hepatic artery aneurysm underwent catheterization of the aneurysmal segment of the hepatic artery. A catheter was advanced from the abdominal aorta into the hepatic artery and into the pseudoaneurysm where a coil was deployed. This was successful in eliminating a 5-cm pseudoaneurysm with the patient being hemodynamically stable. Despite the successful intervention, the patient continued to have severe abdominal pain and tachycardia. A CT scan showed significant portal vein congestion. To avoid potential complication from portal vein thrombosis, the right portal vein was selectively catheterized and a coil was deployed to obstruct the pseudoaneurysm. As the portal vein congestion resolved on the CT scan, the patient underwent removal of four splenic artery pseudoaneurysms and a splenic artery stenting procedure. The patient was subsequently maintained on systemic heparin to thrombolyse the patient's splenic aneurysms and to prevent further in-stent thrombosis.\n\nWe are going to focus on the following trial:\nTrial title: \"Clinical evaluation of vascular occlusion using ultrasound-guided percutaneous coil embolization in managing traumatic pseudoaneurysms\"\nThe trial description is following: A prospective, multi-phase, two-arm (active versus control), randomized trial of ultrasoundguided percut",

The factor is apparently released by hepatocytes from tumorous rats inoculated with either C58 or H35, and it is probably produced by both the rat hepatoma 87 tumor cells and cultured hepatoma cells as well. The inhibitor of gluconeogenesis was isolated from the conditioned medium and concentrated about 100-fold. The concentrating procedure employed was based in large part on its behavior as measured by an end point immunoassay. Pairwise immunodiffusion in agar demonstrated that the inhibitor and a glucocorticoid-induced immunoreactive material are antigenically related. When added to the incubation, the concentrated inhibitor did not alter the conversion of lactate to pyruvate; however, the lactate was not utilized for glucose formation. In addition, the intracellular content of lactate was low in the presence of the inhibitor. These results suggest that the inhibitor acts by causing a reduction of glycolytic flux into the glycogen synthesis pathway.<EOD> HYBRID PAPER\nThis article introduces a new feature published in the International Journal of Aviation Psychology, the hybrid paper, which allows authors the opportunity to publish an article which combines some research findings and some creative expression and which may not fit perfectly into the usual research-report format.

A multimodal management approach for the disorder and pain control is needed due to the lack of satisfactory long-term response. In this pilot study it was aimed to evaluate whether the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and hyaluronic acid (HA) would provide pain control in patients with lichen planus.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nEighteen patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) who complained of pain were enrolled in the study. Lesions were treated with PDT using 5-aminolevulinic acid for once per week for 2 weeks. To support the treatment 0.2% HA was used. Participants were instructed to apply the treatment on the lesion site once per day for 9 days. The patient was allowed to resume their daily life. The change in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores associated with oral lichen planus was measured at baseline and day 15 (before the second treatment).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment with PDT and HA was well tolerated and accepted by all patients and no adverse events were observed. Significant improvements in NRS and VAS scores were observed following treatment. The mean NRS values of the patients at baseline and on the 15th day were 7.1\u00b11.3 and 4.6\u00b11.6, respectively (p=0.0001).

The mean follow up period was 6.28 years. Hospital mortality was 16%. Two patients required aortic reoperation for valvular failure at 12 years and 7 years, respectively. Four patients in the DSC-AVR group required another aortic surgical procedure for a residual sinus coronary sinus (SCS) obstruction. In one of these patients, an aortic endarterectomy was performed in the left coronary cusp (LCC). The valvulopathy-free long-term survival rate at 5, 10, 20 and 25 years was 87.0%, 76.2%, 43.5% and 32.1%, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nS-AVR seems to be a good alternative to DSC-AVR, especially for patients with concomitant aortic root pathology requiring enlargement. However, there were patients with a large SCS in the DSC group, in whom late aortic reoperation was necessary due to SCS narrowing, and the number of these patients is likely to be fewer for patients who undergo S-AVR.<EOD> .\nThe authors report their experience in pericardial effusion percutaneous drainage and catheter sclerosis in 48 patients suffering from",

The three compounds also demonstrated significant anti-glycation activity against the formation of Amadori products, which were compared with the standard (Vitamin C: VC). Compound 1 exhibited superior anti-glycation activity relative to the reference compound, VC. Anti-tyrosinase activity was carried out in vitro, and all compounds were significantly more active than the reference compound, arbutin. Honey samples treated with the three pectin derivatives showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity and the lowest hydroxyl (\u2022OH) radical scavenging activity, as determined by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique, compared to the control and \u03b1-terpineol derivative treatment.

There are few randomized studies performed in patients with diagnosed IDDVT and no adequate information is available on the risk of IDDVT left untreated.

The present study, a natural history study investigating IDDVT in a controlled prospective design, aims at assessing the clinical consequences of IDDVT diagnosed but not treated. The trial design is based on the hypothesis that IDDVT do not need to be diagnosed and treated, as long as they do not spread beyond proximal deep veins and provided that they are not diagnosed at high rate. The diagnostic-therapeutic procedure of the present investigation remains the usual one, based on CUS investigation extended to diagnose proximal DVT, to be repeated after 5-7 days (or earlier) to exclude an extension to proximal veins of an IDDVT potentially present.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nsuspected deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins\nintermediate/high pre-test clinical probability or high",

In this work, we discuss the questions whether the frontiers of this new reaction-diffusion system are connected under some conditions. The localization property and the stability of the frontiers are also concerned. We prove that if a frontier is nonempty, it cannot be isolated and an isolated frontier can have only finite number of components. Moreover, we find that if two frontiers can meet (or can be connected), there is a solution of the system converging to the frontier.\n\n# Introduction\nIn this paper, we investigate the behavior of the Susceptible\u2212Infected\u2212Susceptible model with linear incidence rate, proposed in [bib_ref]  Reactiondiffusion models for the spread of diseases in heterogeneous populations, Martcheva [/bib_ref] . The main motivation to study the model is to investigate the emergence of a spatial pattern of the epidemic spreading in space. In [bib_ref]  Dynamical pattern of epidemic spread on heterogeneous graphs in reactiondiffusion SI model, Shi [/bib_ref]  , a novel traveling wave solution is found for the linear incidence model in Erd\u0151s, R\u00e8nyi, infinite-dimensional graph and in the homogeneous Poisson graph. In [bib_ref]  Fronts in a linear incidence reaction-diffusion model for disease spread, Shi [/bib_ref]  , front solutions are found for the linear incidence model and the traveling wave solution is also studied. Recently, the frontier and asymptotic profile of the linear incidence model are discussed in [bib_ref]  Epidemic spreading in reaction-diffusion systems on heterogeneous networks, Fu [/bib_ref] .\nThe Susceptible\u2212Infected\u2212Susceptible (SIS) model with nonlinear incidence rate was proposed by Kendall and Gurney [bib_ref]  Epidemic",

To facilitate infection, phage-encoded proteins can form pores across the OM. We have previously shown that the liposome remodeling (LR) phages encode a phage-encoded protein, gp, that can induce pores in synthetic and bacterial OMs. By the combination of cryo-EM, electrophysiology and single particle analysis we show that gp forms transmembrane pores with an oligomeric structure resembling the transmembrane portals recently found in eukaryotic Ca 2+ -ATPase channels. In addition, we report that gp can also mediate liposome fusion in a membrane-cholesterol-dependent manner with no requirement of periplasmic domains to interact with membrane or proteins. Fusion could occur with or without cholesterol indicating that gp might utilize lipids in the inner membrane (IM) to facilitate formation of fusion pores, possibly by direct interaction between the phage and the prokaryotic host. Phage particles can use this fusion property to facilitate ejection of their phage genome into the host cytoplasm during infection, which would represent a strategy employed by phage to overcome the barrier of phage infection to Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n# Introduction\nBacteria possess a protective outer membrane (OM) which is comprised of a tight phospholipid bilayer containing large amounts of amphiphilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [bib_ref]  A new picture of intestinal lipid digestion emerges.

This concept has been described as an ethical dilemma in the nursing literature. This study looks at the underlying principles of ethical awareness that lead to and shape the dilemma of deciding to or breaking bad news to a grieving family. While both nurse and family are affected by the decisions of the other, what is most important is the ethical awareness that guides that nurse and family through their actions and the decisions they make at that time. Ethical principles of utilitarianism, deontological rights, and the nurse's personal values were identified through the literature and are explored further in this paper. Two research questions guided this study: The first question is: What are the underlying assumptions in decisions made by nurses in breaking bad news to families? The second question is: How do nurses define caring and who do they define as patients? An ethical dilemma is defined through ethical theory and can be used by the nurse to make better decision-making processes and improve practice. The dilemma of breaking bad news to grieving families can be addressed by practicing ethically within the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. This is the responsibility of the nurse. The nurse is responsible to promote and protect the patient's best interest by practicing within the ethics of beneficence and nonmaleficence.<EOD> Preoperative Computed Tomography Angiography Can Predict Adverse Events Following Catheter",

An expert system is, at the most basic level, the creation of a knowledge base that contains a set of facts or conclusions that represent common and important facts about a certain domain, such as clinical trials. It also includes rules about how to make inferences based on those facts and conclusions. The domain may include things like the clinical characteristics, exclusion criteria, and inclusion criteria of clinical trials. Given the description of a patient, a trained expert system can process the rule set and determine the eligibility for the clinical trial. \nThe domain consists of 20 clinical trials. You need to determine the eligibility of each trial for each patient described by his patient note mentioned above. This task could be challenging, even for medical experts. You will be able to develop a clinical expert system through the use of a script file. The script determines which criteria should be checked first for each patient note and for other tasks you would like to do. The script file is saved as .rb file by default.\nThe first line, namely a comment, of .rb script is: require \"Rosalind.\" Your script would be saved as trial_expert_system.rb.

The highest mutant frequency was obtained in liver homogenates of mice given 450 mg of phenol suspended in the suspension medium by gavage. The results indicate that a maximum of 10 micronM benzoquinone in vivo could have mutagenic effects on cells exposed in liver metabolic system. The present studies suggest that in the event of human exposure to phenol, in addition to benzoquinone, it is necessary to evaluate the carcinogenic effect of phenol.<EOD> Oxygenation of rat skeletal muscle during contraction: lack of dependence on Na+/K+ pump activity and altered sensitivity to oxygen in skeletal muscle mitochondria by NH+4\n1 The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the hypothesis that in rat soleus and",

Genetic evidence from mice revealed that the transcription factor NF-\u03baB2 (p100) and its processing enzyme Bcl3 are required for the LMP-1-dependent B cell proliferation observed in vivo. Using an in vitro co-culture system for LMP-1-activated B cells, we defined the downstream events that trigger the B cell response to LMP-1 and that are dependent on p100, Bcl3, and the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Surprisingly, our results showed that the B cell proliferation, but not survival, is completely dependent on the presence of LMP-1. This growth was completely abrogated by the inhibition of TRAF2, but not TRAF3 or TRAF6, and a kinase-inactive I\u03baB kinase complex. Thus, in addition to NF-\u03baB, LMP-1\u2013induced B cell proliferation involves TRAF2 and the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway.<EOD> The effect of vitamin A status on the immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in children with previous exposure to live poliomyelitis vaccine\nVitamin A supplementation was given to 1",

The results of the theoretical investigation show that the TPA and TPAT derivatives are endowed with stronger electron donor capacity than the quinoxalinium ones, being consistent with the observations from experiments. For the TPA and TPAT derivatives, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) dominated by the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition has a large extent of contribution in their overall emissions. The ICT is strongly connected with the local charge redistribution which is affected by the molecular structure.

For example, suppose you have two trials, A and B, and four patients, P1, P2, P3, and P4. Given A, you want to find out which patients from the set P would be eligible to participate in this trial. You need to determine which patients should be selected first and whom. The system first gives the assessment of eligibility of each patient in a simple and convenient format.\n\n## Data-driven system for clinical trial enrollment\nWe can also make a data-driven system which automates researchers' decisions. For clinical trial enrollment, we need to decide on which patients to be enrolled. We can create a simple decision tree system, e.g., shown in Fig.1, and automatically pick those patients who appear first, e.g., P1 and P2, from the set P. In the system, a decision tree with a branched selection, a set of conditions, and a final result is produced. By using the set of conditions, one can quickly determine which candidates should be considered for specific trials.\n\n## Efficiently search eligible patients and trials\nFigure.1: An application to select eligible patients for a clinical trial \n\n### Create a list of trial-eligible patients\nFor example, you may list patients who fit the set of criteria, such as age, gender, and type of disease (criteria 1, 2, and 3, respectively), in the set P. The results may include those matching the criteria 1, 2, and 3 or those matching the criteria 1 and 3.\n\n### Create a list of eligible trials\nFor example, you may list trials matching criteria 1, 2, and 3 or criterion 1 and 2.\n\n### Create a list of trials that contain eligibility of multiple patients\nOne researcher wants to match a clinical trial to the patients with a particular genome.

In the present study, a method for E. coli O157:H7 typing is developed using two strategies. The first strategy employs repetitive extragenic palindromes PCR (rep-PCR) combined with PFGE to produce a dendrogram with the ability to differentiate all twenty-seven isolates tested in a variety of hosts. The second strategy focuses on the restriction analysis of total nucleic acids (TNA) by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) to detect small sequence variation in both single and multiple bands of TNA digestion by a series of restriction enzymes. By comparing their restriction profiles and the locations of the bands, the rep-PCR combined with PFGE could produce distinct band patterns representing different isolates, whereas the rep-PCR combined with SSCP could differentiate multiple restriction fragments having different sequences, but with very similar electrophoretic mobility. The combination of these two strategies is shown to be effective in differentiating all 27 isolates.<EOD> Evaluation of the Effects of Dietary Arginine on Heat-Stressed Broiler Chickens\n\nSimple Summary: Heat stress in poultry reduces performances by impairing biochemical pathways necessary for energy and protein utilization. Immune response to infectious agents and tissue healing mechanisms are also negatively impacted by heat stress. Dietary supplementation of arginine has been demonstrated to stimulate growth, enhance immune responses, and boost poultry thermotolerance.Abstract: One hundred-eighty day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were used to evaluate the effects of arginine (AR) supplementation on productive performance and tissue gene expression in broilers submitted to different thermal conditions. The birds were distributed into two thermal models: 1) constant ambient temperature (CON) with 31 - C from day 2 to 42 (n = 48), and cyclic ambient temperature with mean",

A total of 33 healthy female patients, 16\u201319 years of age, were assigned to three groups according to the type of naloxone regimen; the control group and two treatment groups were given a single oral naloxone dose of 8 or 16 mg, respectively, 30 minutes before induction of anaesthesia with 1.5 MAC of a 0.75% halothane\u2010O2 mixture. The third group of patients received the same dose of IV naloxone at the same time as induction, with the second group receiving a 0.5 mg\u2010kg\u22121 dose. The data showed that postoperative recovery was not correlated with any significant differences in time. No side effect was observed either postoperatively or in the immediate recovery period. It was concluded that neither the single oral nor the IV dose of naloxone, 16 mg, before halothane administration caused a significant rise in prolactin levels when 1.5 MAC of halothane was used for sevoflurane\u2010N2O anaesthesia. Furthermore, the peri\u2010operative use of oral and IV naloxone had no effect on the incidence and severity of the postoperative nausea and vomiting episodes and on the requirement of rescue antiemetic drugs.<EOD> Molecular and Clinical Analysis of a Family Segregating a Mutation in MYH7 Causing Hy",

If you consider that the number above is an integer, for example 11, the highest patient grade in the three-point scale is the average; therefore, the highest score in the trial-level score is 1. The average score of the two groups, in which the grade is 0 or 1, is the maximum score to be used in the Trial-level score; therefore, the score must be 1. As for the other group whose score is 2.

As you have seen in Section 4, the aggregated score can be generated with the following steps:\n1. The Trial-level eligibility score for a clinical trial is computed by aggregating all of the Trial-level eligibility scores of its all notes. Thus, if a clinical trial has six notes, the aggregated score will be equal to 2*(2) + 2*(2) + 1*(2) + 1*(1) + 1*(1) + 1*(1). \nIf the score is 2 or more, the patient is eligible. If the score is 1 or less, the patient is ineligible. If the score is 1, the patient should be considered by the trialist.\nThus, the eligibility score range is (2, 3], and the three groups are:\n\u2022 Eligible 2* n + group : Aggregate score >= 2 \uff06 score <= 3\n\u2022 Ineligible 2* n \u2212 group : Aggregate score < 2 \uff06 score >= 2\n\u2022 Consider 1 n * group : Aggregate score >= 3 \uff06 score < 2\n2. Note sequence for a new patient. Note sequences are represented as a list in a certain order. The same note cannot be presented twice in the same order. \nLet L be a list of n notes from a patient note list P .  Then aggregate_score(L) stands for the sum of all of the trial-level eligibility",

Design The FVMS consisted of a ready-to-eat combination of a fruit, a vegetable and nuts. The 6-month intervention study was conducted in primary school children (mean age 10\u00b76 years) where every child was randomly assigned to consume daily, for lunch or as a (weekly) snack, either the FVMS (n 111) or a regular snack (NS) consisting of fruit or fruit and vegetable (n 111). Results At baseline, mean daily dietary energy intake was 2295 (sd 328) and 2291 (sd 309) kJ/d for the FVMS and the NS group, respectively. At month 6 the intake of the FVMS was significantly higher in the FVMS group in comparison to the NS group (45\u00b70 (sd 14\u00b75) v. 21\u00b79 (sd 16\u00b70) %, P < 0\u00b7001) and the nut consumption in snacks was also significantly higher in the FVMS group compared to the NS group (26\u00b76 (sd 15\u00b77) v. 6\u00b72 (sd 9\u00b74) %, P < 0\u00b7001). As compared to the NS group, the FVMS significantly decreased total cholesterol (\u221210\u00b75 % with NS, 95 % CI \u221221\u00b79, \u22120\u00b71 %; P = 0\u00b7046) but showed no significant differences for the changes in BMI Z-scores, waist circumference, fasting glucose, HbA1c and LDL and HDL cholesterol. At baseline the NS group had significantly higher intakes of carbohydrates",

        "output": "<EOD> Aging, Disease and Innovation: New Opportunities for Older Persons to Participate in Research\nAbstract Over the next 25 years, the US-Hispanic population will nearly double in size. Older Hispanics will experience the fastest population growth and the greatest declines in income, health and longevity. By age 2050, the Hispanic population will account for an estimated 26.4% of the total population. The Hispanic elderly are projected to double to at least 20.1 million aged 50 or older and triple to 3.4 million aged 65 or older. These older persons will represent one out of every five elderly Americans. The U.S. Hispanic population will age from relatively young and healthy to relatively old with significant health disparities. Age associated chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, depression and Alzheimer's disease, will rise dramatically in prevalence. As the population ages, there is an increasing need for Hispanic-friendly healthcare settings and interventions. Innovations in technology, telehealth, health informatics and social research will offer new opportunities for older Hispanics to access health information and promote self-care. Healthcare providers that understand the impact of age and disease on this rapidly growing population will be better able to assist patients and to improve outcomes. Hispanics age 50 and older will be the fastest growing majority group by 2016. By age 65 in 2050, the Hispanic population will be the largest national minority group aged 65 and over. Hispanics are the only growing U.S. ethnic group older than 65. The aging of the Hispanic population will influence family formation and size, and the demands on extended family caregivers. Older Hispanics must be included in the U.S. research agenda or aging, disease and future innovations will not address their needs.<EOD> The complete mitochondrial genome of the darnel Chrysopsis salsolae (Ullrich) (Poaceae)\n\nThe complete mitochondrial genome of the darnel Chrysopsis salsolae (Ullrich) (Poaceae",

The skin lesion `is now oozing`, and the clinical signs of the venous ulcers such as `varicosities, hyper pigmentation, stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and edema.`. This means patients that are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and persistently elevated HbA1c are eligible patients for the current trial. If you pass all the inclusion criteria of this trial, the eligibility would be `2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`. \nFinally, you should repeat the trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Highly likely to refer this patient for this clinical trial.`.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThere are many possible factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study.

To pursue this observation at the molecular level, the effect of propranolol on gene expression was studied in the pancreatic beta cell-derived tumor cell line INS-1 through Northern blot assay. Treatment of INS-1 cells with 10 microM propranolol for 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in insulin 1 and 2 preproinsulin mRNA levels. The effect of propranolol on intracellular trafficking and secretion of insulin was studied in isolated rat islets after labeling cells with sulfate 35S. When cells were preincubated for 18 h in 10 microM propranolol, followed by addition of (35)S-labeled sulfate, there was a significant decrease in secreted and total cell-associated proinsulin (80%) and insulin (37%) compared with control cells. Moreover, an increase in intracellular insulin immunoreactivity was observed in propranolol-treated cells. In the case of the secretion process, propranolol treatment for 3 h of a 48-h sulfate 35S labeling protocol caused a 45% decrease in the secretion rate of proinsulin. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of propranolol and salbutamol on the translocation rate of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase in the plasmamembrane fraction isolated from rat liver. The results show a significant inhibitory effect of propranolol on membrane protein translocation in rat liver. Also propranolol and propranolol sulfate did not affect (35)S incorporation in plasmamembrane proteins when isolated hepatocytes were incubated",

The aim of this study was to determine the expression of BMI-1 and Ki-67 in lung cancer tissue. The association between BMI-1, p16, and Ki-67 expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics of lung cancer patients was also examined. Methods: The expression levels of BMI-1, p16, and Ki-67 in 95 patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays. The \u03c72 test was used to evaluate correlations between BMI-1, p16, and Ki-67 expressions and clinicopathologic characteristics. Immunohistochemistry-stained tissue microarrays were read by two pathologists. Results: BMI-1 expression was weakly positive in 40%, moderately positive in 34%, and strongly positive in 26% of lung cancer patients. Positive BMI-1 expression was significantly associated with histology, pathologic stage, and positive lymph node metastasis. The p16-positive expression ratio was 42%. There was a statistically significant correlation between p16 expression and tumor size, pathologic grade, and pathologic stage. Ki-67 expression was weakly positive in 47%, moderately positive in 44%, and strongly positive in 9% of lung cancer patients. Positive Ki-67 expression was positively correlated with histology and pathologic stage. Conclusions: Determination of the BMI-1 expression level in tissue sections may be a prognostic factor for lung cancer, and it is also associated with histology and pathologic stage.<EOD> A pilot study of the effectiveness of a group intervention to support people affected by AIDS in Hong Kong\nAbstract Increase in the number of HIV/AIDS among the Chinese population and the associated psychological problems call for innovative intervention programmes",

While the abstract contains your main conclusions and the key ideas that you want to emphasize, the discussion is the chance to tell the reader your thoughts on why your conclusions are accurate and what they might mean.\nFirst, if the conclusions you draw are based primarily on analysis of your data, you are asked to summarize the results and then discuss your specific findings within the context of what others were previously found. Try to avoid using only technical words and, instead, explain the findings as simply as you can. You should also include some context so that those who are unfamiliar with the general topic being investigated will understand what the result of your findings might mean.\nOn the other hand, if you have had a very personal experience with the topic at hand, you should discuss your specific results in the context of the more general topic of the problem under study. Discriminate between conclusions that you can prove and those that you can only hypothesize. Your conclusions should be backed up with data that you collected (if your research required it) or, at minimum, some evidence that others have provided in similar studies. Finally, try to be objective about your findings. Even though you are free to believe what you want as far as the scientific validity of your results, you should try to make sure that you are not drawing conclusions that are not backed up by evidence.\n\n# Experimental Design\nAn experimental design can be defined as the plan of an experiment that details how to accomplish specific aims under the set of constraints related to the experimental environment. As part of the planning of an experiment it is important to have an idea of how you are actually going to observe your results. This is where the experimental design comes in.

As far as I see, there are two elements to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I use a for loop with increment (i) or not use a loop at all?\n\n*Should we use Trial-level eligibility, which is meant for aggregated patient notes, at the end of the for loop or not?\nTo address the first question, let's consider a hypothetical patient list, similar to question. As suggested by the questioner, I first try out the 8-patient for loop:\nfor i in range(size):\n    if i == 8:\n        print(\"Trial-level eligibility: 0\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Trial-level eligibility: {}\".format(1))\n\nwhich gives: \n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\n\nAs the print range seems to be 0 <= i <= 7, the first print is for the i value that matches the size of the actual patient list, which is exactly 8. The range in the loop is 0 <= i <= 7 in the print statement, so 7 is the value when break was triggered (but we use max function to break the loop instead).\nBut what happened to the eight patients? They aren't printed anywhere. Let's see what happens when we use a different iteration counter, i.e.:\nfor i in range[0, 8]:\n    if i == 8:\n        print(\"Trial-level eligibility: 0\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Trial-level eligibility: {}\".format(1))\n\nwhich gives now the full eight patients and the trial-eligibility statement:\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nTrial-level eligibility: 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1",

The Effect of DIPYRIDAMONE ON RENAL FUNCTION AND ELECROLYTE EXCRETION DURING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS. (From the Dept. of Surgery, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.) Clinically significant decreases of arterial pH, PaCo2, blood potassium and sodium have been reported, even in healthy patients, during prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass. (I) The reasons for these electrolyte and metabolic alterations have not been clearly established, although hypothermia, hemodilution, acidosis and low intravascular pressure have been identified as major contributing factors. Since in vitro studies have shown dipyridamole to be a potassium antagonist, the ability of this anti-aggregant to inhibit in vivo hypokalemia and metabolic disturbances observed during cardiopulmonary bypass was investigated. This review of two prospective, randomized, clinical trials in which patients received dipyridamole (0.1 mg/Kg.minute) or placebo before bypass surgery reveals a potential protective effect of dipyridamole in prolonging these electrolyte and metabolic disturbances and prolonging normal cardiopulmonary support during postbypass surgery.<EOD> Characterization of the cDNA for porcine zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3), which is the sperm re",

Previous studies suggest that, in the developing rat testis, Leydig cells are derived from Leydig stem cells. Therefore, it is possible that the progenitor Leydig cell phenotype may be different from the differentiated Leydig cell phenotype. We have developed two monoclonal antibodies, L2C5a and L2C7 and two polyclonal antibodies, L2F9 and LF9, against purified Leydig cells from human fetal testes and a human seminoma cell line, NT2/Dl, by immunizing non-human species with Leydig cells. Immunostaining by light and electron microscopies showed that all Leydig cells stained with L2C5a, L2C7, and L2F9, whereas some Leydig cells stained with LF9. Both L2C7 and LF9 are also expressed in Leydig stem cells. Immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies to steroidogenesis markers showed that L2C5a, L2C7, and L2F9, but not LF9, bound to all steroidogenic proteins. L2C5a and L2C7, but not L2F9, reacted with the estrogen-regulated protein 44 and the anti-human estrogen receptor antibody, indicating that they recognize the Leydig cell nuclear receptor (LeyHR). Western blotting showed that L2C5a, L2C7, and LF9, but not L2F9, reacted with a Leydig cell nuclear receptor. L2C7 reacted specifically with Leydig cells, but not with Sertoli cells of the fetal testes or with somatic cells of the adult testes. Flow cytometry analysis showed that L2C7-positive testicular Leydig cells, but not L2F9-positive Leydig cells, were positive with a steroidogenic enzyme marker antibody. The results suggest that L",

The function we have just learned, mnnb, will estimate coefficient for each factor, but we also need to know how much it contributes to the overall response. This is summarized by the pseudo log likelihood contribution, \u3008log L\u3009. As this is the average log likelihood contribution we can estimate expected deviance, which is the expected number of log likelihood units by which the log likelihood contribution by a new observation will reduce the deviance (See previous papers). The code below will generate a plot of the observed pseudo likelihood contributions and a null distribution generated by drawing pseudo likelihood contributions on a Bernoulli distribution with rate equal to the probability estimated by our model for each cell.\n- Now, we would like to compare this deviance to the maximum likelihood contribution minus a pseudo \u03c7 2 (c). In other words, we would like to compare the probability to a \u03c7 2 (c) distribution to the probability calculated by a more general model:\n- One way to do this is through the deviance information criterion (DIC, also known as the generalized cross-validation). The DIC has two components (see earlier papers). The first component is a penalized pseudo likelihood for model estimation. The second component is the estimated effective number of parameters calculated from the likelihood contributions (deviance information score) and is a lower bound on the effective number of parameters for a model with a pseudo log likelihood of similar size. For the DIC, we use the following code:\n- In addition, we can also compare deviance",

We report a rare case of congenital left pulmonary vein (LPU) aneurysm which was detected by chest X-ray (CXRA), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in a 46-yearold male patient referred to our cardiology clinic because of an enlarged heart. We found no evidence of any pulmonary artery anomaly and there was no history of any cardiac surgery or trauma. There was no history or sign of a congenital LPU diverticulum or LPU aneurysm rupture so there was no need for surgery. A computed tomography angiography (C.T.A) scan was done to examine the pulmonary vein and pulmonary arteries. It showed dilatation of the LPU, LMU and RMIU. The arteries were normal but an aneurysm was detected in the LPU. Although the etiology of this anomaly is still unclear, the pathology is probably congenital.\n\n# Introduction\nAn aneurysm of the pulmonary artery is a rare entity. It is uncommon in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary valve, and when they do occur, they are almost always congenital. This condition might mimic dissection of the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary valve, so careful attention must be given to this disease process to avoid diagnostic mistakes.

You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Here is the patient note:\n92-year-old female with diagnosis of heart disease and arthrosis. She presents with acute onset pain in her right hip, with radiation to the right inguinal and trochanteric area, with radiating pain down to the foot. There is no redness or warmness, no swelling.\n\nHere is the clinical trial:\nTitle: Treatment of Diverticulitis\nSummary: SUMMARY~Rationale: Diverticular disease is a chronic condition, characterized by recurring bouts of inflammation of the colonic diverticula. Current treatment options for acute diverticulitis include antibiotics, observation, and surgical therapy, where the latter is reserved for patients with severe disease or patients unresponsive to antibiotic treatment and with signs of peritonitis and perforation. Previous clinical studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be beneficial for diverticular disease. These agents inhibit the physiologic production of prostanoids (e.g., thromboxane A2 and prostag",

A cDNA containing a deletion of 1.9 kb from the end of a naturally occurring cDNA was identified, and its translation product was shown to localize more intensely in the nucleus than the translation product of the other cDNAs tested. This particular cDNA was cloned in the sense direction in an RSV retrovirus vector (Rous Sarcoma Virus) which also allows expression from the SV40 promoter. This clone also had an internal RSV sequence and was cloned so that expression of v-Erb-A proteins is controlled from the SV40 promoter only. The RSV protein, RSVT, could be specifically immunoprecipitated using RSVT antibody (anti-peptide antibody). A series of RSVT fusion proteins constructed to examine sub-cellular localization of v-Erb-A in the presence of a heterologous, but highly structured, c-terminally located nuclear targeting sequence were expressed from the SV40 promoter. Three types of fusion proteins were made: the first comprised the amino-terminus of RSV plus the RSVT sequence and was expressed as an amino-terminal fusion to the sequence for the glutathione-S-transferase (GST); the second fusion protein formed the RSVT sequence followed by the chicken 3' amino acid sequence of a riboflavin kinase (amino acids 245-283) and was expressed as an amino-terminal fusion to the RSVT sequence; the final fusion contained the full-length RSVT sequence. The three proteins were equally well expressed in vivo and in vivo. Protein sequences derived from all three fusion proteins localized to the cell nucleoplasm in the absence of the glutathione-S-transferase. The C",

In patients with pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, hemodialysis may be required after an open-heart operation. If the peripheral artery is not usable, a transaortic graft (TAG) or epiaortic-iliac graft (EIG) procedure may be considered. However, in patients with low cardiac output, EIG is preferable to TAG because cardiac output increases more with EIG, which improves graft flow. When cardiac output is normal, the TAG procedure may be more useful. Consequently, we propose that patients with cardiac insufficiency and chronic renal dysfunction undergo urgent or elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery with EIG, which we routinely use at the Hyogo Medical Center for Cardiovascular Diseases.<EOD> SGLT-2 Inhibitor\u2010Induced Diabetic Ketoacidosis\nThe use of SGLT-2 inhibitors is well known for its association with severe acute kid",

Previously, Insr inactivation was carried out in the pancreatic \u03b2-cell line MIN6 and in the insulin-insufficient C57BL/KsJ db/db mouse. These studies led to conflicting conclusions about the role of insulin signaling in regulating \u03b2-cell function and metabolic homeostasis. We now revisited the question using a conditional Insr knockout model that mimics a more physiologic situation by depleting Insr specifically from \u03b2 cells. A marked resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance was observed in Insrb \u0394/\u0394 mice. This was accompanied by enhanced insulin secretion and preserved insulin content in response to increased nutrient availability. Remarkably, when the model was challenged with a low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) treatment, we observed an abrogation of the STZ-induced blood glucose elevation and complete protection against diabetes in Insr \u03b2-cell\u2013specific Insrb \u0394/\u0394 mice. This was associated with an increased expression of \u03b2-cell neuroendocrine genes, along with improved glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in the Insr \u03b2-cell\u2013specific Insrb \u0394/\u0394 mice. Mechanistically, Insr depletion in the \u03b2 cell had opposite effects: decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and enhanced glucose availability to \u03b2 cells. Accordingly, Insr inhibition of insulin secretion correlated with a decrease in insulin content and an increase in islet neoneogenesis, two features that are characteristic of \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation. In conclusion, enhanced neuroendocrine \u03b2 cell function seems to be a hallmark of glucose homeostasis protection in Insr \u03b2-cell\u2013depleted mice, which represents a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus with a",

On the basis of SI, which detects new protein production, we determined the period from the SI positive cells in various regions of the uterus (cervix, myometrium, and endometrium) to its appearance into the lumens of the same locations. SI positive cells appeared simultaneously throughout the myometrium and cervix. They were distributed along the luminal surface at 2 h 5 min, with a 12-hour delay in endometrial lumen. These results allow the conclusion that, while the myometrium and the cervix share a common progenitor cell population (an undifferentiated cell), the progenitor cell in the endometrium represents a slightly differentiated cell, which has been described as an endometrial stromal cell or a fibroblast.<EOD> Dendritic Cells as Mediators for Apoptosis in Lactation\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells, as they are efficient in antigen presentation as well as their migration to secondary lymphoid tissues.

Therefore, a marker to objectively assess severity of injury would be of tremendous value. Because dogs can be restrained without sedation, they present an excellent species for evaluation of new assessment techniques of severity of TBI. This study evaluated total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration as a marker for severity of TBI and long-term outcome. Three-point and four-point cervical vertebrae were examined by radiographs and computed tomography to evaluate potential spinal cord injury to obtain prognostic information in correlation with CSF total protein concentration and long-term outcome.

The aim of this plan is to help clinical trial coordinators and physicians to identify appropriate clinical trials based on patient characteristics. If you were involved in the training plan or implementation of it, then you know that there are many challenges. For example, patient characteristics alone do not take into account the eligibility criteria for clinical trials (IC), and these are not easily found on the Internet. Some trials have a more or less vague definition of their inclusion and exclusion criteria (IC), so they are not applicable to certain patients. Clinical study coordinators and physicians have to read the whole trial protocol in clinical trial registries to extract the IC, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nThis problem is particularly relevant in a high-throughput setting where new recruitment decisions have to be made per patient visit, which can take as little as five minutes. Here, high-throughput means not less than 30 unique patients per week. And a system supporting the recruitment for the new clinical trials is needed on top of the recruitment for usual care. In this context, machine learning offers a promising solution to facilitate and accelerate patient recruitment. However, the goal of this project is not to invent and create a new recruitment assistant. It would be great if you develop a new and more accurate recruiting assistant than the best-fitting ones already available.

The results have been analyzed for the determination of the diffusion constants (D) and the hydration forces (deltaF) through an improved version of a thermodynamic integration method based on the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) of the particle-surface vector (PSV). For the complexes which have an ionic pair and a hydrogen bond as the driving forces for association, the hydration free energies are negative, which implies that the hydration forces are attractive. The hydration free energy also reveals the order of stability for the studied complexes. The diffusion constants were determined for all of the considered complexes, and the results show that the mobility decreases as the hydrogen bond strengthens. For the systems without hydrogen bond, the hydroxyacetone diffuses much faster than formic acid in the studied concentration range. The results are in agreement with those obtained using the V",

The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NT-proBNP for acute ischemic stroke. Methods: This multicenter, prospective study consecutively enrolled patients in two hospitals. The blood levels of NT-proBNP at admission were compared between patients with favorable outcome, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days, and poor outcome with mRS 3-6. Results: A total of 585 ischemic stroke patients was enrolled between September 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. We demonstrated that patients with high NT-proBNP levels (\u22652,754 pg/mL) were significantly more often male, hypertensive, and had higher white blood cell counts, blood glucose, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, than others. Higher NT-proBNP levels were independent of predictors of poor outcomes (odds ratio (OR): 1.015, 120) of poor outcomes in each group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of NT-proBNP for predicting poor outcome was 0.823 (9",

A description of the patient would help to determine whether the patient is eligible. Information about HbA1c would be useful along with the duration of obesity. The note is not detailed enough to assess whether the patient would comply with a clinical trial and is the note sufficient to support the decision for the eligibility of the patient. The patient shows no interest in changing her lifestyle despite the clear recommendations and despite the seriousness of the condition. Another patient may be eligible only with more details about their diabetes, specifically details about the duration of the disease since the onset. The reason behind the lack of treatment adherence is not stated. The notes may include vital information that determines patient eligibility for trials, but it is missing.  The information on the patient's vital signs has to be described, and in depth detail like duration of obesity and duration of diabetes should also be explained. There seems to be a delay or a lack of management of the patient's diabetes. Even though the patient has been taking medications for the disease the inefficacy or the lack of effort to change the situation may make this person uneligible. This is the only patient eligibility assessment that shows a score of 0; the remainder of the assessments are >0, which means that they are considered eligible.

Of around 1,170 cases officially reported between 1986 and April 1994, between one third and one half were detected among migrants (from Eastern Europe and French-speaking West Africa in particular). In recent years, the epidemic has spread in numerous communities of migrants (e.g. heterosexuals and intravenous drug users) and the rate of seroconvertion remains high. Despite the growing number of AIDS cases officially registered every year, the epidemic seems to be declining for women but not for men. Nevertheless, a stabilization or modest decrease in the number of HIV infections is to be expected.

A group-wise increase in intake of dietary salt was associated with a significant increase in urinary free radicals, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The changes in 8-OHdG, MDA, free radicals, and oxidant stress were reversed when lactoferrin was added to the diet. In addition, the urine flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma creatinine, and plasma urea were significantly decreased. Lactoferrin, in addition to reducing salt-induced oxidative damage, improved the kidney by increasing the urine flow rate and decreasing the generation of free radicals. The changes in renal histology by light and electron microscopy were also reversed.<EOD> .\nWe examined fourteen children with various congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract, including duplicated ureters, horseshoe kidney, multicystic dysplastic kidney, polycystic kidney and ectopic ureter.

The rationale is not fully explained in the notes of the clinical trials, however, if patient has a history on poor adherence, I would consider referring the patient with the above criteria to this clinical trial.\nIn conclusion, I would consider referring this patient to the randomized encouragement trial if the patient has at least 4 medication pickups from the mail order pharmacy in the previous 12 months. If the patient had fewer mail order pharmacy prescription claims in the previous 12 months, I would have had more questions about the previous history of the patient. If the patient had no history to receive prescription, I would have asked questions about the patient and would make an informed decision.\n\"\n```",

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the association among ambient CO levels and stroke mortality risk.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study population was identified from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database (TAQMD) which records daily data of air pollutants from 96 automatic air quality monitoring stations in Taiwan, 2008-2015. Death and population counts were obtained from the Taiwan Death Registry and population datasets of the Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan. The exposures of air pollutants were linked to participant-specific residential areas of mortality and daily time-stratified Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the stroke mortality risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe data of this study were based on 420,427 participants that includes 3,329 stroke deaths. We found a significant association for ambient CO levels and stroke risk; compared to the reference group (the 25th percentile of ambient CO levels 12 \u03bcg/m3, daily CO level\u00a0> 12, the daily CO exposed group (the 75th percentile 24 \u03bcg/m3, 2 < daily CO level\u2009\u00a0< 24 \u03bcg/m3), and high CO level group (daily CO\u2009>\u200924 \u03bcg/m3) that the risk of stroke increased by 0.95 (95% CI:1.04-2.14) and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.09-1.43), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study found that exposure to elevated ambient CO levels could lead to an increasing risk of stroke.<EOD> Evaluation of anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of aqueous-ethanol extract of Heliotropium indicum Linn.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are well-established drug targets for the treatment of epilepsy. In clinical trials for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, sodium-channel blocking anticonvulsants have been reported to produce cognitive impairment. In this study, we performed computer simulations and in vitro electrophysiology assays to determine the impact of sodium-channel blocking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on action potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and their effects on the properties of fast and slow recovery from inactivation. We used three AEDs, carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and carisbamate (CBM), and observed that CBZ and CBM were much more effective in blocking sodium channels, which resulted in profound effects on AP waveforms. CBZ and CBM were 9-and 6-fold more potent for blockage of the neuronal sodium channel, Na v 1.2, which is an important isoform of sodium channel that is expressed in the brain. On the other hand, OXC, compared to CBZ and CBM, demonstrated only a very limited action in blocking Na v 1.2. In vitro studies revealed that CBZ, but not CBM, induced a 71% reduction of the fast-inactivating component of I Na (i.e., INaF) that controls",

The verum group was given 500 mg of acetylsalicylic acid tablets twice a day, 1 hr before breakfast and supper. Then serum 25 (OH) D levels of all the subjects were tested at the end of the second month and 6th month of the treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to baseline, serum 25 (OH) D levels were higher in migraine patients both after 2 and 6 months treatment(p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively). The serum 25 (OH) D levels were significantly higher in the verum than the placebo group after 2 months of treatment (p < 0.05) and 6 months of treatment (p < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAcetylsalicylic acid tablets (500 mg) could increase serum 25 (OH) D levels in migraine patients.<EOD> Preparation and Dissemination of Healthy Meals in the Educational Settings: A Qualitative Study with Teachers and Dietitians\n\nCitation: Camargo, M.d.S.; Pinto Nardi, L.l.C.; de Paula, N.; da Silva, V.A.; Rocha, A.L.I.; Pereira, L.A.; Gadel",

In general, high-dose treatment with ara-C was well tolerated, with only minor degrees of alopecia and slight myelosuppression. In 14 of the 39 patients (36%) there was a good response to high-dose treatment with ara-C, whereas 12 of the 14 responders also achieved complete remission (CR). A high proportion of the responders (11 of 14 patients) received 2000 mg/m2 ara-C, whereas only 3 patients treated with a dose of 1500 mg/m2 reached CR. No statistically significant differences between CR and non-CR patients were observed in respect to sex, age and initial white blood cell count; however, the highest response rate was seen in patients under 35 years of age. The relatively favorable outcome of 2000 mg ara-C given in a single dose as compared to the conventional continuous infusion of low-dose ara-C has been confirmed in the present study. On this basis it would seem to be preferable, however, to combine the high-dose single infusion of ara-C with other induction and consolidation regimens in order to further improve the treatment of ABL patients.<EOD> Ossified anterior cruciate ligament\nOssified anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an uncommon variant of a commonly injured ligament that presents a diagnostic challenge during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The current study examined the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) using a go/no-go paradigm in 21 patients with predominately hyperactive/impulsive subtype ADHD. Disinhibition (i.e., commission error rate) of ADHD patients was higher compared with control individuals. ADHD patients also exhibited more attention bias to drug-related compared with neutral stimuli. ADHD patients had lower pupil diameter and longer reaction time compared with control participants. Patients with ADHD had larger pupil diameter after responding to drug-related stimuli compared with control participants. After MPH administration, disinhibition and reaction time decreased in ADHD patients and pupil diameter of ADHD patients increased after responding to drug-related stimuli compared with pretreatment. However, methylphenidate did not affect attention bias. These findings suggest dysregulation of attentional control contributes to attentional impairment in patients with ADHD hyperactive/impulsive subtype and indicate the importance of controlling disinhibition behavior to prevent substance abuse in this ADHD subtype.<EOD> Role of adrenal-cortical sterols in development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\nA large number of studies have shown that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when compared to normotensive Wistar\u2013Kyoto rats (WKY) have increased adrenocortical steroidogenesis.

Different types of electrodes modified with gold nanoparticles (GNSs) as an electrode modifier have been used for the detection of PSA; also, various surface modifications such as the use of polyethyleneimine for the immobilization of DNA oligomer on their surface have been applied. The aim of the present study was to identify sensitive and specific bioprobes for the detection of PSA; the sensitivities and specificities of various types of electrodes for this study were investigated. We constructed PSA-specific bioprobes based on a DNA aptamer, a DNA aptamer modified with GNS, and a DNA aptamer modified with polyethyleneimine. The obtained results showed that the electrode modified with a PSA-aptamer modified with polyethyleneimine was the most sensitive (p < 0.001) and specific bioprobe for the detection of the PSA antigen.

Here, we report on the optical absorption coefficients of monomethyl rhodamine B (MMRB), a well-characterized laser dye, as a function of dielectric environment and concentration and find that the overall absorption coefficient of MMRB can be tuned with a factor of 10, much larger than the \u223c3-fold change in the case of the bulk molecular species. The observed dielectric environment-dependent variations of second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficients of aqueous MMRB solutions in relation to its first-order extinction coefficient are quantitatively reproduced by numerical solutions of coupled dipole equations for different surrounding dielectric environments, including bulk water, cell cytoplasm, and micelle solutions. These studies imply that nonlinear optical properties of nanosystems can be significantly tuned, beyond the current conventional wisdom, by the surrounding dielectric environment via changes in linear extinction coefficients. These findings provide guidelines for rational design of nanocrystal lasers, optical limiters, switches, and amplifiers with different threshold powers and output parameters to meet the requirements for specific applications.<EOD> Combining antibiotics during nephrotoxic antimony treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.\n\nWe conducted a randomized study of eighty one patients with biopsyproven visceral leishmaniasis, comparing nephrotoxic antimony treatment with and without antimicrobial agents to prevent potentially life threatening sepsis after a glomerular kidney membrane injury during the treatment.

Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, patients can have varied clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to severe with fatalities. Pregnant women are at a great risk of acquiring the infection. Though pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state caused by increased vascular permeability and increased synthesis of vasoconstrictive materials, studies have shown that the risk of mortality appears to be lower in pregnant women. This may be due to the physiological changes induced by the increased expression of ACE2 during pregnancy. The new variant SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, also called VUI-202012/01 or 501Y.V1, initially found in Kent, United Kingdom (UK) in December 2020 is said to be 50% more transmissible than other strains circulating at the time. The increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain made it responsible for a wave of COVID-19 cases in the UK and in other European countries. Studies have revealed the possibility of vertical transmission, although studies are inconclusive. Clinical features in infected neonates appear to differ from those of adults as there are several unique findings including lack of fever, milder disease, poor laboratory finding, and less severe clinical symptoms in neonates. This review will focus on the effect of COVID-19 on preterm and term infants.\n\n# Introduction\nCOVID-19 which is caused by SARS CoV-2 is a respiratory illness that was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Neocin\u00ae (MDIA), a diphasic insulin preparation, with a conventional regimen (Conv) in 42 patients with type I diabetes, matched for age and duration of diabetes. The groups were well matched and did not differ in HbA1c before the study. Following 6 months of treatment, those receiving Neocin had a greater decrease in HbA1c (-2.13% of control values) than those receiving Conv (-1.31), and the difference was significant by comparison of areas under curves (AUC) for HbA1c (nM) (p = 0.0247) and serum glucose (p = 0.0140). Frequency of hypoglycaemic events per patient-week was also significantly lower for Neocin patients (0.65) than for Conv patients (1.24), as was the frequency of total severe hypoglycaemia (14.0 versus 27.9, respectively). Although daily insulin dosage was significantly lower in the Conv group than in the Neocin group (0.86 plus/- 0.42 versus 1.04 plus/- 0.32 units kg-1, respectively; p = 0.0366), this did not lead to significantly worse glycaemic control in the Conv group. Thus, Neocin therapy was equivalent to a conventional insulin regimen in controlling diabetes in patients well matched to those receiving conventional therapy.<EOD> Acute pancreatitis after liver transplantation with living donor.

The authors found the highest mortality rate after a diagnosis of advanced cancer among the group with the longest time taken from diagnosis to initiation of palliative cancer care. A similar study from Thailand showed that, in adult patients who had cancer and were admitted to hospital, only 25% were discharged with comfort care only, 39% with cure or control of disease, and 28% with hospice referral. A significant number of terminally ill adult patients required a long course of hospitalisation. We believe that, in addition to other reasons already cited, the main cause of late referral to palliative care is early discharge before referral to palliative care services. This study showed that the time taken from diagnosis to cancer referral was significantly longer in Thai hospitals which do not have palliative care units on site. We suggest that the government can play the role of an educational institution rather than a regulatory authority for palliative care. The Ministry of Public Health, being the main manager of medical services in Thailand, is well organized and equipped with many specialists in oncology. Thus, the Ministry can have the responsibility to teach staff from every hospital, both general and nursing home, how to provide the best possible palliative care even if the hospital does not have palliative care unit on site.<EOD> .\nA 34-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for left ovarian tumor.

Chloride was by far the most potent inhibitor of growth, especially within the ranges of pH 5 to 7. The pH-effect curve, which was linear, indicated a stoichiometry of acid-base combinations in the presence of chloride. Growth rates of bacteria were affected by the concentrations of the anions tested, but the pH-chloride interaction was more significant, being responsible for increased or decreased growth rates. Growth rates were very sensitive to the concentrations of chloride, being reduced at 10-fold higher concentrations, but the pH-chloride interaction also reduced the effect. At pH 7, the effects of inhibition and enhancement of growth were counterbalanced. Increased concentrations of iodide, which had minimal effect on growth rates of the strains tested, altered the inactivation curve for both tetracycline and 2,6-diamino-8-cyanopurine. The inhibitory or antagonistic effects of minor changes in concentrations of inorganic substances on the effectiveness of antibiotics in suspensions are discussed.<EOD> Influence of the presence of HPV16-specific DNA methylation in tonsillar non-cancerous cells on the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in malignant cells.\nPatients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have substantially better survival outcomes with anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapies, and the persistence of HPV DNA within oropharyngeal malignant cells can help to stratify these patients as",

A recent study showed that LH exerted pro-survival functions against apoptosis in cumulus cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the function of apoptosis in cumulus cells is regulated through LH/LH receptor (LHCGR) interactions. This study was designed to examine the expression and localization of LH with its receptor, along with changes in apoptosis-related factors in cumulus cells at the ovulatory and luteinizing phase. We also investigated whether LH and its receptor were induced in vitro in human COCs and in murine granulosa cells (GCs) of ovary. Immunocytochemical method and western blotting analysis were used to detect LH and LHCGR in humans by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that LH and LHCGR were highly expressed in cumulus cells surrounding COCs, not mural cells. LH and LHCGR were positively expressed in human CCs of ovulatory phase and luteinizing phase, while little expression was seen in those before hCG treatment in the IVF-ET program and the 2-cell embryos of IVF program. Expression of caspase 3 was relatively low while BCL-2 and BAX were positively expressed in cumulus cells. LH and BCL-2 were highly expressed in the 2-cell of zygote stage and in early blastocyst stage embryos and LH expression was high in 8-cell embryos of IVF program. By treating COCs and GCs with 10 \u03bcg/L LHCGR for 24 h, results showed that both BCL-2 expression and LHCGR expression of human COCs in vitro were up-regulated and expression of caspase 3 was reduced comparing to negative control in vitro.

Intravenous administration of different concentrations of acetylcholine to rats in vivo resulted in increased permeability of albumin into the brain. Since all three muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes were found to be expressed in the brain and the M3 receptor is also highly expressed in choroidal endothelial cells, we isolated cerebral microvessels and studied M3 receptor activity and the effect of selective antagonists on the acetylcholine-induced increase in BBB permeability. Receptor binding experiments revealed M3 receptor activity in both brain capillaries and choroid plexus. The M3 receptor antagonist MT7 decreased the acetylcholine-increased BBB permeability, whereas the H3 receptor antagonist clozapine did not have an inhibitory effect. These observations are in agreement with the in vivo findings and support the notion that the M3 receptor mediates the acetylcholine-induced increase in BBB permeability",

Treatment with a fever-reducing drug usually improves the patient's symptoms and reduces systemic inflammatory responses. Fever and the systemic effects of an inflammatory reaction are linked by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1\u03b2. For the clinical pharmacology of fever-reducing drugs, the effects on the production of proinflammatory cytokines are of particular interest. Because the production of those cytokines is controlled by the hypothalamus\u2013adrenal\u2013medullary\u2013axis or inflammatory transcription factor (NF\u03baB), the mechanisms of drug action to reduce fever are also linked with the regulation of the systemic inflammatory reaction in patients. Pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models have helped to elucidate the mechanisms of action of drugs in patients with sepsis. We review the current state of understanding of the PKPD of antipyretic drugs based on the results of PKPD analysis studies in animal models and patients with sepsis and malignant lymphoma.<EOD> Evaluating the impact of health\u2010related quality of life measurements on medical decision making\nThe article provides an overview of the impact of health\u2010related quality of life (HRQL) instruments on medical decision\u2010making.

Many papers report on the discriminative performance of the test by estimating the area under the ROC curve. Other papers suggest that this area can be approximated by the diagnostic odds ratio which provides a test of the null hypothesis that the odds ratio for the test is one (no discrimination) and is of value if dietary and exposure data are missing and the outcome variable has a dichotomy. However, in situations where the outcome is continuous, as is the case in measuring lung function and interpreting the results of pulmonary function tests, the interpretation of the discriminative performance of the test may not be clear. Previous researchers have examined this problem, but we have not found any discussion of the confidence interval coverage of the diagnostic odds ratio estimator and the confidence interval coverage of the area under the curve estimator. We therefore compare confidence interval coverage, in simulated data, using logistic regression, ROC curves and log\u2010linear regression. The two log\u2010linear regression approaches are recommended when data are available in cases and controls for both a quantitative binary variable in the outcome and the risk ratios of the test under study.

Methods: A total of 38 intrabony pockets with clinical attachment levels (CAL) \u2265 4 mm were treated with osseous resective procedures. After pocket dissection, deprotonated gelatin sponges or collagen membranes with osseous resective procedures were placed individually for each patient. Clinical measurements were made at baseline and 6 months after surgery and included the plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, gingival recession, attachment level, and vertical bone level. Results: At baseline and after 6 months, the probing depth, clinical attachment level, and vertical bone level were not significantly different between the two groups (p \u2265 0.05). The probing depth reduction was significantly greater in the collagen membrane group than in the deprotonated gelatin sponge group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Based on these findings, the use of a collagen membrane could be favored in the treatment of intrabony pockets of \u2265 4 mm to increase the clinical attachment level of periodontally diseased teeth.<EOD> Genomic Evidence in Medical Malpractice Litigation: From Discovery to Adjudication\nAbstract Genetic tests are increasingly being used in medical malpractice",

In this article we review the various studies that evaluated the CSDD and report the results of a new validation study of the CSDD as a diagnostic tool in patients with AD. A total of 184 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD were screened for depressive symptoms using the CSDD. A final score of > 6 for the CSDD was considered positive for depressive symptoms. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to confirm the presence of depression and the results of a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were also recorded. The diagnosis of depressive symptoms by the CSDD was significantly associated with depression diagnosed by the DSM-IV-TR and confirmed by the GDS (n = 58; z = 4.11; p = 0.000) and with the GDS scores (z = 1.97; p = 0.048). The CDR was not significantly associated with the CSDD scores. The optimal cutoff score of the CSDD was determined to be 7. In conclusion, the CSDD appears to be a valid and effective tool for detecting depression in geriatric clinical settings.<EOD> An Evaluation of the Quality of Spinal Surgery in Europe: A Comparison of 12 European Spinal Centers\nStudy Design.

Hence, we will produce patient-level eligibility on the patient note. If the note is on a single patient, we must add a string to the patient name. If several patients are in the note, we will need an extra word to distinguish the individual patients. It is possible that no patients apply eligibility to some fields, e.g., gender male. Thus, we will consider a negative string to indicate that no patient applies on that field. If there is no patient in the note, we will show an empty string. \nWe use different fields to indicate patient-level eligibility, e.g., patient-level eligibility 1.

Some 45 molecules structurally modified from the common parent scaffolds were collected as a set of active compounds, and the rests were considered as the set of inactive molecules. These two sets were divided into two subsets with similar sizes before the PLS regression analysis. The molecular shape parameters were treated in the same way. It was shown that the best regression models were obtained when considering the shape effect or the scaffold-hopping effect in the molecular structures alone, even without considering the set of inactive molecules that have only the common parent scaffolds. The inclusion of the set of inactive molecules that have scaffolds other than the common ones resulted in an increase in the prediction ability. The inclusion of the set of inactive molecules structurally modified from the common parent scaffolds decreased the prediction ability because there were very high outliers that were distantly deviated from the regression line. The obtained results were compared with the previous 3D-QSAR study, in which the genetic function approximation (GFA) method with the cross-validation test was employed.<EOD> Role of the Rho/Rho Kinase/MYPT1/MLC Pathway in Pulmonary Hypertension.\nPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal pathophysiological process characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired vascular tone.

Methods: A retrospective review of all patients identified by the retinal department database with the ICD9 diagnosis of vitreous hemorrhage treated with cryotherapy within the period from 1995 to 2005. Vitreous hemorrhage was considered to be the primary cause of blindness. Results 41 consecutive eyes had cryoretinopexy for vitreous hemorrhage. 23 patients were analyzed. Only one needed pars plana vitrectomy in the 1st postoperative month. In the follow-up period (mean 18.5 months) 9 patients (43%) gained 3 or more lines, and the mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity after 1 year was 0.8 (Snellen acuity: 20/120). Conclusions Vitreous hemorrhage was a serious complication of eye diseases. Patients with vitreous hemorrhage require surgery because of retinal detachment, optic pit leakage, retinal tears or dialysis, and traumatic or nonorganic subretinal fibrosis.

Ozone is a strong oxidant with a high potential to inactivate biological and chemical reactions. The objective of this study was to develop and test a novel method to assess the effect of an increased ozone concentration on enzymes, which are produced during particle-particle interactions between diatom bacteria and bacteria, and on the microzooplankton grazing rate. Results. Results showed that the method was effective to detect ozone effects on enzymatic activities. The method was tested with cultures of the bacterium Alteromonas macleodii and diatom bacterial cell aggregates. Alteromonas macleodii showed an increase in the activity of alkaline phosphatase and phytase when incubated together with aggregates, whereas these activities were greatly reduced in the presence of ozone. The novel method showed that the effect of ozone was different when the bacterium (Alteromonas macleodii) and the diatom (Thalassiosira rotula) were alone compared with the mixture of diatoms, bacteria and ozone. Diatom induced enzymatic activities were stimulated by ozone, while the effect of ozone was less intense on bacterial enzymatic activities in",

It is inevitable to assess the final results based on the evaluation criteria. Thus, it is recommended to develop a series of evaluation criteria before predicting the final results of all clinical trials. The evaluation criteria for the clinical trials are listed as below.\n1. Crossover or non-crossover RCTs\nThe assessment of the final result based on the evaluation criteria is shown in Table C.2.\nBased on Table C.2, the eligible trials are shown in Table C.3.\n**CROSSOVER STUDY PROTOCOL SUMMARY\nA crossover trial has two periods, including pre-period and each post-period within the cross-over trial. A patient may be randomly assigned to treatment A period followed by a treatment B period or vice-versa. The washout period between the two phases is necessary to prevent carryover effects from one phase to another. Crossover trials can reduce a study's sample size as a treatment effect measured by the difference in both treatment periods could be the same. Hence, crossover design could be an alternative methodology when parallel non-crossover RCTs cannot be conducted. The most critical issue when designing a crossover trial is to determine the length of the washout period needed. Several guidelines on how to calculate the washout period length according to the pharmacokinetics effect size and the expected duration between each stage have been proposed on the website of the Cochrane Network. The Cochrane Handbook is available from www.cochrane-handbook.org . The steps of the Cochrane crossover trial reviewing in this study are listed as below. The first step is to conduct a comprehensive literature search. By using \"Cochrane Crossover\" plus trial or study as the search string, the Cochrane Library will list all the Cochrane crossover reviews.

However, the pathways by which substance misuse affects the course of BPAF and vice versa are largely unclear. The aim of the present research was to explore the psychopathology of BPAF comorbid with substance misuse. Method: A series of 71 patients was divided into two subgroups, i.e., BPAF group (n = 43) versus BPAF and substance misuse group (n = 28). The two groups were compared on 26 psychopathological and clinical variables. Results: Subjects with comorbid BPAF and substance misuse had a significantly higher number of previous affective episodes, a higher lifetime prevalence of substance misuse, an earlier age at onset of substance misuse, more current suicidal ideation, and a higher rate of suicidal and violent behaviors than the rest of the BPAF group. Conclusions: We hypothesized that there is a causal relationship between BPAF and the onset of substance misuse, which in turn aggravates the clinical course of the BPAF phenotype.<EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nA large proportion of chronic otitis media are the result of cholesteatoma.\nTHE METHOD: A retrospective multicentered study of 2568 cholesteatomas performed between 1975 to 1990 and 1997 to 2004 in 6 major ENT surgical university services in Tunis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThis series is made of 2568 patients (62% adults).

It often requires a large financial \noutlay and a long and difficult trial enrollment process, particularly in psychiatric/neurologic diseases, which are prevalent in the United States. To alleviate this problem, computational approaches have been created for automated recruitment process on large scales. However, previous work only evaluated their performance based on standard clinical notes and failed in clinical trial-level assessment. The evaluation has been proven to be insufficient for understanding the real-world situation. The authors of this paper investigate the feasibility of trial-level performance evaluation through the data of clinical trial eligibility note in a case study.\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in the case study and illustrate how the use of machine learning technologies to support the clinical trial recruitment process can affect the recruitment process by analyzing the trial-level eligibility note.\n\n# Appendix 2 -Data Availability\nThe [bib_ref]  The RECORD statement: Procedures for identification and extraction of data from published..., Simera [/bib_ref]  The datasets are composed of a total of 209 patient notes with 15,126 words (327 tokens) (excerpt) and clinical trial descriptions with 10,402 words and 340 terms (340 tokens).

This meant that if a student graduated after three and then took the master\u2019s three years later, they would get both degrees at once. In the twentieth century, as higher education became more common for more people, it was common for students to graduate and then later go on to get another degree. It can be said that, with this decision, Harvard College and later universities set into motion the idea that it should be ethical to apply for, and receive, a second higher degree at the same time as you graduated. However, some colleges and universities were against this idea, saying that it would create graduates who would then be unemployed for many years. Some others were worried that having a second degree would take away from the other person who was also applying. One of the concerns was that there would be times when people would be using the resources of one person without paying them for the cost.

Because the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years following 65 years of age, MCI may occur in as many as 17.5 to 27 percent of men aged 65 years or older in community-based samples and 21.5 to 30 percent of women over the age of 65. Although it has become common to use the clinical diagnostic criteria for AD in research on amnestic MCI, the clinical criteria have major limitations. MCI patients with memory deficits are highly heterogeneous with respect to their cognitive status and prognosis. Several biomarkers for AD are now available to define MCI more precisely, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS-ADRDA) proposed research criteria for subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to AD. These new criteria can be used to select MCI patients with a high likelihood of AD and to test drugs that may delay progression from MCI to AD.<EOD> .\nThi\u00e9ry have considered that the most important element of the antigen presentation is an HLA-DR molecule.

The project aims to evaluate the effect of a multi-modal intervention protocol on improving social competence among children with at-risk mental states. The study was granted ethical approval from [redacted name].\n\nTo understand and explain the protocol of the evaluation. The project will involve a multi-modal intervention protocol for 10 children with at-risk mental states over an 8-week period. The intervention group will be given the following protocol: cognitive behavioural therapy, parental training, school-based intervention and a multi-family group intervention on top of treatment as usual. The control group will only receive treatment as usual by medical or rehabilitation services (including regular psychiatric clinic visits). All relevant details on the intervention content will be discussed with the family members and medical/rehabilitation personnel according to the protocol. The details of the protocol will be in accordance with the protocol for multi-modal intervention being developed by the PI. Information about the intervention plan and related risks involved will be provided to the participants and their caregivers. Subsequently, the intervention will be implemented for the participants allocated into the intervention group.\n\n\n\n# Methodology\nA descriptive and longitudinal approach will be used. Data on demographic information will be collected at the baseline assessment. Clinical information will be reviewed by the investigators. Social competence, cognitive function, and family functioning will be measured at baseline, post-intervention (after 8 weeks), and three-months follow up. Relevant assessment instruments and scales will be used. We hope to be able to compare the social competence and cognitive function between the experimental and control groups. In addition, it will also help in establishing a better service plan and in the development of a multi-modal intervention protocol for children with at-risk mental states.\n\n\n\n# Results\nAt the end of the study, results of changes in scores of the instruments and scales will be assessed for internal consistency and content validity.

The present work focuses on the field dependence of the decoherence temperature, where the Kondo effect arises from the coherent coupling of the donor spin to the conduction electrons. This coupling yields a Kondo temperature that is different from the thermal one due to an additional energy scale associated with the decoherence of the donor spin. To this end, we have employed ac susceptibility measurements with microwave excitations. We found that the two-component Kondo effect is only observable for certain values of the magnetic field, where the coupling between the donor and the conduction electrons in the singlet state is weakened. This allows for the Kondo resonance to be strongly enhanced in the doublet-singlet transition. This fact has a bearing on the application of the technique in the detection of weak electric-field effects, because the transition frequency decreases with increasing electric field, thereby reducing the effectivity of the dephasing process. On the other hand, the observation of this effect implies that the electrical control of the exchange coupling is sufficient to significantly modify the Kondo temperature. This will be of interest for experiments in the framework of the quantum computation approach.<EOD> Clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic associations of follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma in thyroidectomy specimens\n\n [bib_ref]  Follicular thyroid carcinoma.

The electrical auditory brainstem responses were evaluated by the stimulation of the IAstim intraoperatively. The patients' hearing was further evaluated at different time points over 6 months postoperation.\n\n\nRESULT\n4 cases of 5 patients were implanted successfully with 40 electrode contacts. The auditory brainstem responses were evaluated intraoperatively. Patients 1 and 2 regained hearing on the fourth and twenty-seventh days, respectively. They had some problems at various degrees, but all of them were basically recovered in 3months after the implant. Patients 3 and 4 regained hearing on the second and third month, respectively. The hearing level achieved by patient 3 were stable while patient 4 regained no hearing. Patient 5 failed to regain her hearing.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIAstim provides a new way of treating deafness due to auditory neuropathy.<EOD> The Impact of the FDA\u2019s Proposed Changes to Smokeless Tobacco Product Warning Labels in India\n\nSmokeless tobacco product (STP)-related morbidity and mortality have become increasingly prevalent in India.

Glenohumeral joint capsule was connected to a pressure apparatus for pressure studies of the shoulder joint. Gastric juice was infused into the esophagus of cadavers to provide refluxate. Infusing pure stomach juice resulted in a decrease in capsule pressure measurements. When the pH of the stomach juice was artificially changed by adding either HCL or acetic acid, the decrease in pH of the gastric juice resulted in a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the pressure values recorded. No significant difference was recorded in the pressure values between pH 1 and pH 4. Stomach juice has been demonstrated to affect the joint capsule pressure directly. Thus,",

After an overnight fast, the subjects ingested either an oral dehydroepiandrosterone capsule (60 mg) or a comparable placebo capsule (nine placebo capsules) 2 h before determination of metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry. Mean age was 21.2 +/- 0.9 yr and body mass index was 21.8 +/- 3.3 kg/m2. The mean RMR was 8.3 +/- 2.5 kg CO2/hr (666 +/- 222 kcal/day) at baseline and was 9.4 +/- 2.0 kg CO2/hr (826 +/- 136 kcal/day) at 4 h after the DHEA acute loading in the treatment group, which was statistically significant (P < 0.005). There was no significant change in metabolic rate after placebo administration. No effect of DHEA was seen in body temperature. We propose that this increase in metabolic rate after dehydroepiandrosterone administration may reflect increased fat oxidation, at least in part, due to an increase in energy expenditure induced by DHEA.<EOD> Examining predictors of social support in patients with chronic kidney disease.\nBACKGROUND\nSocial support impacts physical and mental health and health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, but less is known about its predictors among such patients.

An important aspect of recovery in these disorders is restoration or replacement of communication function. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has recently been used to facilitate recovery of language functions in patients with focal brain damage. The authors describe a series of studies in which a TMS \u201cspeller\u201d facilitated communication in aphasic patients. Methods: The authors review a series of studies in which patients with severe aphasia and motor dysphasia successfully used a TMS \u201cspeller\u201d to spell meaningful words and sentences on a computer. Patients were adminstered daily sessions of rehabilitation using the TMS speller in conjunction with physical, occupational, speech-language, and nutrition therapies. After a two- to ten-week period of TMS treatment, the patients showed improved fluency, and were able to use a modified version of the TMS speller outside of therapist-directed sessions. Results: These case reports suggest that TMS is a viable tool for enhancing verbal communication in persons with disabling brain damage. Conclusions: TMS offers a method to facilitate communication in aphasic patients who cannot cooperate or tolerate standard rehabilitation regimens. It may be possible to use TMS as a complementary therapy to speech therapy or as a stand-alone treatment.<EOD> Rheumatologic and musculoskeletal diseases. 9.

A method has recently been developed whereby computer-graphics software is utilized to generate three-dimensional computer-aided designs and computer-aided manufactured parts of bones or bone grafts from the CT and MRI images of cadaveric specimens, which have then been used in bone transplantation procedures. A 3D reconstruction program has been written that first performs image segmentation, followed by geometric reconstruction based on a new \"region growth\" algorithm. This algorithm involves the establishment of a seed point in a region of interest and the subsequent application of a \"region-based\" operator called the \"region grow\" operator to progressively expand the boundary of the region from the seed point until it surrounds the entire region of interest. A method for assigning colors to each segmented region was introduced which used the average intensity of each region as the hue component and the ratio of the maximum and minimum intensity of each region as saturation and brightness, respectively. This program was run on a Silicon Graphics Iris computer using the IRIS Indigo 3000 workstation and the IRIS WorkSpace workstation in order to view the segmented results and to manipulate the segmented regions during the segmentation process.<EOD> Evaluation of the use of an electronic information-support tool to improve the management of blood pressure in primary healthcare: protocol for a randomized controlled trial\n\nBackground: Hypertension is a major health problem, especially in high income countries where its morbidity and mortality are increasing.

A single operation was performed in 39 patients, two in 4, two to six in 6. The most frequent levels involved were the atlas and C1-2 (36%), C1-C3 (26%) and C2-3 (22%). The mean hospital stay was four days. Transient Horner's and hypoglossal nerve paralysis was seen in 2% and 14% of the cases, respectively. Five patients presented with postoperative cervical arachnoiditis. Dysphagia, facial palsy and paresis were not observed in any of the cases. A transient neurological deficit, such as a radicular or mixed palsy, was seen in 12 (24%) of the 50 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data obtained confirm the validity of the transpedicular approach to the upper cervical spine in our series. However some patients present post-operative neurological deficits that disappear spontaneously. This approach may predispose to arachnoiditis, so its use in cases where a posterior approach is feasible, should be avoided. The technique should only be used in cases of osseous lesions in the middle or lower cones in which the posterior cervical access routes are difficult or impossible.<EOD> N,N'-dicopper(II)bis dihydrate.\nIn the title compound,  or ), the Cu(II) centre exhibits distorted octahedral geometry, formed by two carboxylate O-atoms and four N-atoms from two 3,5-dimethoxytetrazole ligands.

It appears that humans and other primates retain a substantial proportion of neural plasticity through childhood and adolescence. However, it is unknown how neuronal maturation will impact the effects of neurotoxicants and drugs of abuse. Methods Here we used fetal labeled nonhuman primate (NHP) brain to study development of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) throughout lifespan. NHP were injected with 3 H-thymidine on gestational day 26-28 (G26-G28). We first examined the distribution of fetal-labeled TH-ir (tyrosine hydroxylase, i.e. dopaminergic enzyme) neurons with quantitative analyses on P14-P173. Results Fetal-labeled neurons reached the maximal count in the SNc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) around P26-P30 and the counts then gradually decreased to a half of the maximum level at around P76-P93. In the SNc, half-life of fetal-labeled dopaminergic neurons was estimated to be about 19 years. Furthermore, we found that the counts of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc in middle age (52 years) were significantly decreased to about 35% from those in the adulthood (20 years). However, the cells of fetal origin appeared to contribute to a substantial portion of the mature SNc dopaminergic neurons even after mid-aged. Conclusions Our data provide a basis for future research regarding neurotoxicants during the developmental stage impacting vulnerable dopaminergic neurons, but also suggest novel perspectives toward the molecular basis of neurotoxicity including the development of a drug strategy to prevent dopaminergic neuron degeneration.<EOD> The prognostic role of",

A modified version including the addition of an active extension phase has been proposed for use in subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A modified version was developed to be performed both in a supine and sitting position, where a subject performs an active knee extension after a passive knee extension.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe inter-rater reliability of the modified knee-lift (knee extension phase after a passive knee flexion) test was determined in subjects with knee OA (n = 15). Reliability was quantified using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCC) and standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ICCC for peak knee extension strength, active flexor moment, knee flexion range of motion and total range of motion was excellent (r = 0.94, 0.92, 0.85, 0.89 respectively, P < 0.05), whereas for peak extensor moment it was good (r = 0.79). The ICCCs for all variables determined in the supine position were slightly better than those determined in the seated position (peak extension strength P = 0.03; active extensor moment P = 0.30; peak flexion moment P = 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe modified knee-lift test was highly reliable in subjects with knee OA. The test was slightly more reliable for the test performed in the supine position. The method demonstrated here is easy to perform in daily clinic and should be valuable for clinicians.<EOD> Evaluation and characterization of chitosan as a novel anti-microbial agent.\nIn the present",

[Subjects and Methods] A total of 110 stroke patients were recruited. The original DHIQ-C 20-item questionnaire (DHIQ-C 20q) and 13-item questionnaire (DHIQ-C 13q) were developed and the translation was validated from Chinese to English. Both versions of the DHIQ, the Chinese version of the Dysphagia Severity Scale (DSS), and Modified Barthel Index (MBi) were used to evaluate the degree of dysphagia of stroke patients. The DHIQ-C 13q version was compared to its original English version, the DHIQ-E. The internal consistency and convergent validity of the DHIQ-C 13q were tested by using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the Spearman coefficient.[Results] A Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient of 0.925 was generated, while the correlation between the original versions of the DHIQ and its Chinese version was satisfactory at 0.836-0.903. The DHIQ-C 13q score and DSS score were significantly correlated with the MBI score and the number of people with a good prognosis in the DHIQ-C 13q group, and the Chinese version of the questionnaire had good discrimination. [Conclusion] The results suggest that the DHIQ-C 13q questionnaire has acceptable reliability and validity.

These problems are, of course, no less than that fever is a clinical entity, an illness that afflicts individuals and their doctors on a daily basis, and the most common reason for an individual to be seen by a clinician. Many studies have noted the link between higher temperature and psychological problems, such as aggression, suicide and self-harm and this paper will, as well as examining both body and mind in psychological terms, examine the extent to which the two may be linked and the importance of fever as a factor in mental disorder.\nIn the clinic, the distinction between fever and mental disorder in a person seen with raised temperature is usually clear, and treatment of body and mind is presumed to be unrelated. However, the distinction between body and mind is not always clear: can mental or intellectual disorder directly cause increased body temperature or fever?\n\n## Fever and mental disorder\nThe link between fever and mental disorder has long been recognised.

The physiological significance of renin in the thyroid is not known definitively, although many investigators have demonstrated the ability of this renin system to inhibit thyroid growth in vitro and that it may be active in vivo under conditions of thyroid hypoplasia and hypothyroidism. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that renin exerts its action through a local RAAS system. The possibility also exists, however, that the renin system participates in paracrine control of thyroid function. It is certain that there is a direct action of thyroid hormones on renin, as this has been shown in vitro, in which tri-iodothyronine stimulates renin production and secretion, although the mechanism of this direct effect is unknown. The possibility that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the thyroid has enzymatic and regulatory properties not related to angiotensin generation cannot be ruled out. It is likely that the renin system that may play a role in thyroid growth and function may represent one of the intrathyroidal systems that are involved in a negative feedback mechanism of thyroid function.<EOD> Effects of Tetrodotoxin on the Latency of Micturition in Rats\nThe latency of micturition was measured by a cystometrography method.

The experimental group started using a hip-girdle orthosis, whereas participants in the control group were assigned to followup visits and did not wear a hip-girdle orthosis. The back muscle strength, core stability, and quality of life were measured at 4 and 12 weeks. The back muscle strength and core stability were measured by isometric dorsal flexion force (IDF), and Oswestry Disability Index, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of variance in IDF at 2 consecutive follow-up periods (4th week; 12th week), and paired samples t-test at 12 weeks between 4th week and 12th week revealed a significant difference (p < .05). In addition, analysis of variance in Oswestry Disability Index at 4th week, and 12th week, and paired samples t-test between 4th week and 12th week revealed a significant difference (p < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing hip-girdle orthoses for patients with LDH increased the IDF and core stability, and improved the Oswestry Disability Index. Therefore, hip-girdle orthoses can be considered as an important therapeutic option for the treatment and prevention of LDH.<EOD> Correlation of pigment in situ and in scrapings of dental plaque.\nCorrelations between pigment in situ in dental plaque and in scrapings of dental plaque obtained by mechanical cleaning by dental instruments",

In clinical studies, lung adenocarcinoma has often been analyzed as a homogeneous cancer type or grouped together with lung squamous cell carcinoma. To understand whether lung adenocarcinoma patients will truly derive the same benefit from similar therapies as those with lung squamous cell carcinoma, we conducted this pooled analysis of patients with stage II/III lung cancer using the National Cancer Data Knowledgebase based on the histology of the tumor (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma). Patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n=73,081) were compared with those (n=9104) with lung squamous cell carcinoma. The analysis was conducted separately from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, then lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, which were separately considered. We found that the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients is significantly inferior to that of lung adenocarcinoma patients, and among those with NSCLC, the 5-year overall survival probabilities were 61.12% for lung squamous cell carcinoma and 76.83% for lung adenocarcinoma.

We aimed to (a) assess the proportion of people who remit, develop chronic symptoms or relapse; (b) explore how depression over time relates to these clinical states; and (c) explore risk factors associated with chronic depression and chronic remission.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 'first-episode of psychosis in the community study' was followed for 24 months. The sample at 24 months consisted of n = 398 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (n = 267), schizophreniform (n = 73) or affective (n = 58) psychosis, and of n = 261 patients with a depressive disorder. Symptoms and function were assessed at baseline and the 24-month follow-up and compared with patients in remission defined as Clinical Global Impression scale score 1 or 2.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLess than a third of the participants (n = 106 of 309, 34%) had developed chronic depression or discontinued pharmacological care at the 24-month follow-up (i.e. non-remission), while n = 203 (66%) were in remission.

The recent demonstration that IL-4 can induce immature murine but not mature human B cells to proliferate in the presence of the cytokine mimetic, anti-CD40 mAb has raised the question of whether IL-4 and IL-10 can act additively in this setting. IL-10 was included as a possible negative effector of B cell activation because IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) expression is up-regulated on activated B cells and IL-10 has been shown to inhibit Ag-Bearing lymphoma cells from proliferating in response to membrane-expressed recombinant CD40 ligand (rmCD40L). We have compared the responses of purified CD38(lo) murine bone marrow pre-B and immature (IgMdim) splenic B cells incubated in the presence of rmIL-4 and rmIL-10. Although immature spleen cells responded to rmIL-4/rmIL-10 in vitro with increased proliferation, differentiation, and Ig secretion as compared to IL-4 alone, CD38(lo) B lymphoid cell line B3 cells and immature pre-B cells did not proliferate in response to either cytokine. Analysis of the CD38(lo) B cell subset showed that more than 90% of these cells expressed IL-10R. B cells and immature pre-B cells, however, had only barely detectable IL-10R. Moreover, IL-4-mediated proliferative responses of both splenic and B3 cells to rmIL-4/rmIL-10 were totally aborted by the removal of 80% of the IL-10R + cells before culture.

Although the phylum Bacteroidetes is one of the major constituents of microbial communities in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments, Cytophagales are generally scarce in most of these environments. Their genome encodes several Cytophaga-like glycoside hydrolases and \u03b2-propeller domain proteins, which have been identified in the phylogenomic analysis of glycoside hydrolases and \u03b2-propeller domain proteins, respectively. The number of genes encoding those enzymes is not proportional to the sequence diversity of Cytophagales in metagenomic databases. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenomics of Cytophaga-like glycoside hydrolases and \u03b2-propeller domain proteins in the genomes and metagenomic samples from soils and freshwater and marine environments. The genomes of nine representatives of Cytophagales were analyzed to construct Cytophaga-like glycoside hydrolase family enzyme profiles and estimate the number of genes encoding those enzymes in each genomic dataset. The results of phylogenomic analysis were mapped on a neighbor-joining tree with 5,000 bootstrap replicates to estimate the phylogenomics of Cytophaga-like glycoside hydrolases in soil- and freshwater-derived environments. Most of the genes related to \u03b2-propeller domain proteins originated from the Bacteroidetes phylum, of which the Cytophagales were a major constituent. The \u03b2-propeller-encoding genes from Cytophagales and Bacteroidetes were mostly represented by the families SPR0012 and SPR0065, respectively. The families SPR0012 and SPR0065 were closely related to each other. Cytophaga-like glycoside hydrolase families displayed high interfamily diversity, while several members of",

A study of the urethral pressure pulse and reflex responses during ejaculation in the dog.\nAbstract A study has been made on the role of the urethra and urethral musculature in ejaculation in the dog. By intraurethral catheterisation, intraurethral pressure pulses could be recorded before and during ejaculation. Cystometrogramms showed that the bladder was not emptied when the semen and the urethral fluid was expelled and that the prostate gland was only slightly contracted during this expulsion. The semen left its original location after the urethral expulsion. The possibility of a negative pressure in the urethral expulsion, which might be important for semen expulsion, was not shown. The time of ejaculation was not related to the intraurethral pressure pulse. It was concluded that the force of the urethral pressure pulse on the urethral plate has no role in initiating the squeezing of the urethra, which expels the semen and the urethral fluid.<EOD> Clinical features and outcome of patients diagnosed to have acute intestinal tuberculosis.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study and analyze clinical features and outcome of patients diagnosed to have acute intestinal tuberculosis.\n\n\nDesign\nObservational study.\n\n\nSetting\nDepartment of Medicine, Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, and Department of Medicine, Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan; from August 2012 to August 2014.\n\n\nMethods\nAll the patients who were diagnosed to have acute intestinal tuberculosis were included in the current study.

This study was designed to evaluate CV risk by age and BMI category, while determining correlations between CV risk factors and TS patients' history and presenting symptoms.MethodsA retrospective chart review over 3 years' time period was conducted. 32 patients diagnosed with TS (X0 karyotype) were included to the study. The participants underwent clinical examination and completed the questionnaire filled with personal details and CV complications. The questionnaire consisted of 39 multiple choice and semi-open questions, and was constructed in-house after review of the literature and discussion in our multidisciplinary team to assess CV risk as recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program -Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (NCEP ATP III guidelines) from 2001.\n\n# Results\nThe mean age of patients included in the study was 17 years. Hypertension and dyslipidaemia were diagnosed in 31% and 53% patients, respectively. Abnormal lipoprotein profile was found in 25 patients (78%), 9 of which were smokers. Abnormal glucose tolerance was diagnosed in one patient. A tendency towards abnormal BMI values was observed in all patients. BMI \ufffd 30 was found in 14%, while 22% of females had a BMI \ufffd 25. There were also significant differences in the risk assessment in relationship with age categories, e.g. patients of the age 13-17 were 15 times more predisposed to lipid disorders than patients of 8-12 age bracket group.\n\n# Conclusions\nAssessment of lipid disorders and hypertension in TS patients is very important, considering the fact that CV morbidity and mortality in TS group is increased.

In comparison to the values found in liver from nondiabetic rats, 1) gluconeogenesis was decreased and 2) the apparent affinity to glucose was decreased and the maximal velocity of phosphofructokinase was increased in the presence of allosteric activator. The rate of glycolysis was slightly increased by MP at a low concentration of pyruvate. The maximum rate was not influenced by methylprednisolone. At high pyruvate concentration",

        "output": "<EOD> Diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptomatic benign and malignant bone lesions.\nUNLABELLED\nIt is well documented in the literature that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the musculoskeletal system is the preferred initial examination because it provides information on morphologic and anatomic details to guide subsequent radiologic work-up of the bone marrow. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality with a high sensitivity in the detection of malignancies in bone. This may cause a reduction in the number of percutaneous bone biopsies for evaluation of unknown bone lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging in combination with dynamic T1-weighted sequences shows higher accuracy than computed tomography with bone scan for benign and malignant bone tumors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMagnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in the initial diagnostic work-up of bone lesions. MR image with dynamic T1-weighted sequences in combination with bone scan or PET can rule out malignant bone tumor.<EOD> TPx protein RopA inhibits RNA silencing and promotes virus accumulation in Nicotiana tabacum.\nBoth plum pox virus (PPV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), belonging to different genera in the family Potyviridae, encode Rop-repressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing (RNA silencing) proteins (or Rop proteins). To evaluate the effects of Rop proteins on host RNA silencing in plants infected with RNA viruses, the infectivity of plum pox virus (PPV, genus Potyvirus) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, genus Cucumovirus) mutants lacking or expressing a Rop protein was evaluated during systemic infection of Nicotiana tabacum L.

As a StackOverflow user who has been asked to do homework/deliver code reviews on other homework assignments in the past, as well as doing it myself quite a few times, I think that the \"expert\" in StackOverflow is not going to be necessarily the right person to review your solution, since reviewing a solution for an assignment, rather than a problem, is quite a bit more involved. However, I can definitely help out with how to solve the problem which is presented to you. The good first place to start is to get this assignment broken down fully into its parts.\n\nYour solution is presented the \"I/O-Problem\". This part is straightforward: first you ask for the patient data, then you ask for the trial data.\n\nThe next part (\"Program Input\") has no code in it yet. When you have all the information you want to pull from the patient note you need to store in a variable, you need to pull it out of the raw input. The most immediate problem is that there is going to be a limit to how much you're allowed to pull in. Assuming the limit is 1000 records - though in practice that number can go much higher - then if there's a record with a million characters in there you're going to be limited to that 1000 record limit per read(). If in practice this isn't the case, then you'll need to do all the same data reading into a string and cut out all the information you want to store.\n\nThat's one issue. The other is in how are you storing the information? That's a programming problem in its own right.\n\nWith all your inputted data you can probably then begin a simple loop through the trial data to get the trial-level information you need, as that is all just a straight-up comparison and a few logical statements, which you can find a solution to with some internet searching.\n\nAll in all, this could be a simple matter of a bit of simple programming - but with a bit of practice and experience you'll be able to tackle these kinds of problems a lot faster.\n<EOD> .\nFifteen years ago, we suggested the use of a method based on transvaginal scanning to diagnose bladder",

However, the intracellular dynamics of endogenous \u03b1\u03b3 dimers and \u03b2\u03b3 dimers differ and recent data suggest that the \u03b2\u03b3 dimers of heterotrimeric G proteins localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. To determine the intracellular distribution of endogenous \u03b1\u03b3 dimers and \u03b2\u03b3 dimers, we used an \u03b1\u03b3 dimerization domain derived from an atypical protein kinase C protein to specifically retain \u03b1\u03b3 dimers at the plasma membrane. This \u03b1\u03b3 dimerization region also retained endogenous \u03b2\u03b3 dimers at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. Thus, \u03b1\u03b3 dimers and \u03b2\u03b3 dimers can interact. Previously, we reported that heterodimeric GABAB receptors can form \u03b2\u03b3 dimers that lack \u03b1 subunits and these \u03b2\u03b3 dimers can functionally interact with \u03b1\u03b3 dimers of receptors lacking \u03b2\u03b3 dimers. Here, using in silico modeling of the GABA complex structure as a template, we determined that \u03b1\u03b3 dimers can bind \u03b1\u03b3 subunits of GABAB receptors, but cannot bind \u03b2\u03b3 dimers. Conversely, \u03b2\u03b3 dimers of heterotrimeric G proteins can bind \u03b1\u03b3 dimers, but cannot bind \u03b1\u03b3 dimers of GABAB receptors. Furthermore, we show that GABABR \u03b2 subunits can recruit \u03b1\u03b3 dimers and/or \u03b2\u03b3 dimers to distinct intracellular regions in the ER and at the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins have a unique capacity to form functional GPCR-heterotrimeric G protein complexes that can be selectively recruited to a broad range of intracellular locations.<EOD> Chat",

Methods: Adult patients (N = 1,758) with poorly controlled diabetes who were not enrolled in a clinical trial were observed over 6 months using a stepped-wave study design, with an intervention implemented sequentially across three clinics over 11 months. Contact from pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians for 14 weeks was increased by two calls per person per month. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with A1C levels #7.0 by 6 months. A random sample of patients was interviewed at baseline and at 6 months. Results: The proportion of patients with A1C #7 at 6 months increased from 50.8% to 66.6% and by 8.04% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.58%, 13.51%) overall; within clinics, the proportions improved from 27.2% to 53.0% and from 53.2% to 69.3% and the increase was 25.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.3 to 41.3) and 16.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.0 to 27.1). Proportions with A1C #7 at 6 months improved across age, gender, and race subgroups. Surveyed patients reported high rates of satisfaction and improved medication taking. Conclusions: Increased access and care management can substantially improve A1C levels in patients with poorly controlled diabetes within a primary care setting. The effect was greatest for those with initial A1C levels at or above 9.4%, among whom 70% met the target level by 6 months.

OKA is a powerful tumor promoter and a strong immunosuppressant. These phenomena are the first and most prominent manifestations in OKA-treated cells. Previously, a GTPB-sensitive guanine nucleotide protein in the membrane of C2 myotubes, C2OKA1, was characterized as the cellular receptor of okadaic acid (Saitoh et al.: J.

NFkB activation is tightly controlled by the ubiquitously expressed protein IkBa and through IkB kinase beta (IKKb) and IKKalpha, which phosphorylate serine residues in IkBa targeted for polyubiquitination and protein degradation. Here we report the crosstalk between phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) on the regulation of IkBa protein stability. GSK3b phosphorylates IkBa at three residues, S32, S36 and S38, whereas IKKb phosphorylates S19 of human IkBa and S32 of mouse/ rat IkBa. S41 and S42 of human IkBa and their correspondent S40 and S41 of mouse/rat IkBa were dephosphorylated by PP1, but not IKKb. IKKb inhibition significantly increased the half-life of degradation of IkBa. In the case of PP1 inhibition, Ser42 phosphorylation was also observed, indicating the existence of residual activity to phosphorylate in the presence of PP1 inhibitor. Phosphorylation levels of IkBa by GSK3b had little or no effect on TNF-induced NFkB activation, whereas the PP1 inhibition induced significant increase of NFkB activity. Phosphorylation on S40 and S41 decreases binding of IkBa to NFkB, which leads to NFkB activation.

All groups were fed their respective rations in the morning, with no feed withdrawn from the evening for the overnight feeding. At the end of the treatment, the rat's liver was harvested and the hepatic parameters were measured. The results were expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of means.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total protein and albumin levels were significantly lower in khat-fed groups than in control group (p<0.001). The total bilirubin levels, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities showed a significant (p<0.01) increase in the khat-fed groups. The khat-fed groups demonstrated a significant (p<0.01-0.001) decrease in the level of liver aminotransferases such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. The hepatic enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin concentrations, are indicators of liver injury.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nProlonged exposure to a therapeutic dose of khat can induce liver injury and compromised liver function in rats.<EOD> Mapping of Epileptogenic Zone Using Intracranial EEG with an",

The purpose of this study is to identify opportunities for asthma pharmacist-initiated changes to improve patient self-care. Methods: Data collection involved a retrospective review of medical records for the period of January 2012 through December 2014. The sample size was based on nonparametric statistics, which identified a minimum of 100 asthma patients. Patients aged 18 years and older that were enrolled in Health First pharmacy services and had 2 or more inpatient or 2 or more emergency visits during the 12-month period were included in this project. For patients who had 3 or more hospitalizations 90 days before and after the intervention date, a chart review of the medical records was conducted. Records were coded for the specific intervention to identify opportunities for improvement. Results: A total of 100 patient charts with at least 2 hospitalizations of asthma exacerbations were reviewed. Based on the hospitalizations, 40% had an emergency department visit, 26% were hospitalized, and 77% had a physician visit within 60 days before and after the intervention date. The results for emergency department visits showed a statistically significant difference between the pre-and postintervention periods (P = .034). Similarly, there was a significant decline in hospitalization for asthma visits prior to the pharmacist intervention (P = .03). Results also showed that there was no significant difference concerning the number of inpatient days (P = .271) and the number of outpatient visits (P = .054) between the 12 months before and after the intervention.

All these lectins had a higher capacity to bind when seminal plasma was removed from the epididymis and was stored for 24 or 48 h compared to fresh samples. Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) in equine ejaculate was bound by SNA, WGA and PNA, whereas no binding was found when using concanavalin A (ConA). The percentage of total binding in ejaculates from old stallions was higher with WGA than with PNA. Seminal plasma proteins contain complex branched and neutral sialic acids, which seem to be important in modulating the binding capacity. The findings suggest that sialic acid binding to SNA is due to specific epitopes, whereas binding to WGA and PNA in equine ejaculates seems to take place through sialic acids in polygalactosamine groups. The possible functions of sialic acid-carrying seminal plasma proteins are presumed to be sperm agglutination and motility of the spermatozoa.<EOD> Phase I trial of the novel tyrosine",

Oyelade, et al.<EOD> Effect of 1,3-Diphenylguanidine on the Permeability of Red Cell Membranes\nSummary: 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), an antihypertensive agent, is the most potent membrane-stabilizing compound ever known. It is shown that this compound and its related compounds protect red cells against hemolysis produced by hypotonic saline, osmotic shock, or freeze-thawing. In contrast to the behavior of hemolytic anemia drugs, DPG protects the red cell membranes against a lipid-specific membrane destabilizer such as digitonin, but not against a protein-specific destabilizer, e.g., trypan blue, or a membrane nonpenetrating compound, e.g., acetylcholinesterase. The protective effect of DPG also occurs in the presence of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, e.g., ibuprofen. From these observations it is suggested that DPG has a specific stabilizing effect on the membrane lipid phase and it is suggested that one mechanism of antihypertensive action of DPG is its membrane stabilizing activity in an adrenergic nervous system. The membrane stabilization is a nonspecific process.<EOD> Effects of 20-hydroxyecdysone on the morphology of rat ureter epithelial and mesenchymal cells in culture.\nExplants of proximal ureter segments from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats incubated for 48hrs with 10 ug/ml of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E): a) inhibited growth; b) resulted in an enlargement of the lumens of the early branched ureter tips of the explants without changing the proportions of the various cell types in the explanted segments; c) increased cell proliferation and d) cell motility; e) modified cell size (increases in endoplasm to nucleus",

This growth rate is related to the cell's metabolic pattern. The highest growth rate can be accompanied only by the use of the hexose phosphate (HEXP) pathway and by the expression of the enzyme 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (P-GLD) encoded by a g6pd gene . The present results show that there is no direct relationship between the level of PGLD and the growth rate of various L cells with different characteristics. L cells that are able to display high specific growth rates or that display low rates can either be low or highly enzymatic. Cells that are very poorly enzymatic and that grow poorly are able to express high quantities of PGLD. It can therefore be concluded, both from the results presented here and from those obtained in a previous paper , that it is not the g6pd gene itself that is controlling the growth rate of the cell but rather another genetical element (most probably the product of a structural gene) that is co-functioning with PGLD. The same conclusion can also be obtained for the metabolism of the hexoses and in this case it can be added, by the present results, that this element could not be the hexose transport genes. Thus the role of the g6pd gene in the determination of the growth rate is probably due to its direct implication in the control of the intracellular concentration of NADPH and also the result of the control that this gene has over the enzymatic activity of some reactions which are implicated in the HEXP pathway.<EOD> Evaluation of a novel, simple, inexpensive and fast procedure based on serum \u03b3\u2010glutamyl transferase levels and platelet distribution width to enhance prostate biopsy outcomes\nTo assess if evaluating the combination prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) levels, serum \u03b3\u2010glutamyl transferase (GGT) and platelet distribution width (PDW) could enhance our identification of patients with prostate cancer over using only P",

[END]<EOD> The effect of pigeonite on siderite and calcite crystallization kinetics.\nExperiments were conducted to determine whether the presence of pigeonite, a ferric-aluminum silicate, affects the crystallization kinetics of calcite and siderite. Crystallization experiments were conducted using calcium alginate as template for precipitating calcite at pH 10.2 and siderite at pH 6.5. Ferric iron ions were added to experiments containing 10, 50, and 100 mmol\u00b7kg-1 Fe as ferrous sulfate. The effects of iron additions with respect to kinetics were recorded by measuring pH and calcium and silicate concentrations. An experiment, without pigeonite added, served as a reference. All experiments showed a lower dissolution rate at the highest iron addition. Dissolutions rates of calcium and silicate were lowered by up to 10-30 and 30-130%, respectively. With the exception of two low-iron-addition experiments for siderite, the remaining experiments confirmed the formation of siderite crystals. The crystallization of siderite required a longer induction period, and its growth was slower at iron additions of 10-34 mmol\u00b7kg-1 (100-1000 mg Fe added to the calcite solution). The observed delay in the formation of siderite is due to the formation of complexes between Fe3+ and sulfate which affect the chemical speciation of S2O32-. This, in turn, slows the precipitation of S2O32-. In contrast to experiments involving siderite, it was not possible to precipitate calcite in all precipitation experiments containing dissolved",

It has been claimed that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may reduce hospital mortality, and improve long-term prognosis of patients with AMI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom January 2004 to August 2007, 67 elderly patients of AMI were treated with intravenous LMWH (4300 ACEU, once a q 12 h), while 42 elderly patients of AMI were taken as controls. Renal function was evaluated by calculating the serum cystatin C and creatinine clearance rate of patients on admission and discharge.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences in baseline data before receiving LMWH. Compared with controls, renal functions of patients receiving LMWH improved dramatically. Renal functions of the two groups of patients were still stable by the time of discharge. After 6 months of hospitalization, the mortality and readmission rates of the two groups of patients were no significant difference.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn combination with intravenous injection of LMWH, renal function of elderly patients of AMI would be improved, moreover, it may be safe and effective, as well as having lower cost, lower complication rate.<EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nThe aim of the present investigation was to elucidate possible differences in psychosocial parameters between cancer patients and normal participants.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA total of 162 cancer patients (pts) participated in the study.

The Canadian census recorded an increase in the population over 65 years over the last 30 years, and the proportion of Canadians 65 years of age and over is expected to reach 21% by 2016. With an aging population, more Canadians may contract Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and health care providers must be knowledgeable about this disease. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its incidence rate decreased dramatically beginning in the 1940s and continued well into the 1980s because of improved public health measures. In Canada in 2012, 1469 cases of TB (66 cases/million) occurred, making TB the most important of the communicable diseases in the country. In 2012, 1168 cases occurred outside of a health care institution. In that year, Canada\u2019s age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 6.",

As a common component of human saliva, glucosyltransferases from S. mutans (SmGtfs) can transfer glucans to Candida antigens, and antibodies generated by immunization with SmGtfs can inhibit adherence of Candida species to the epithelium of the oral cavity. A recent investigation showed that a single strain of C. albicans can be immunized with two different antigens, and immunization with multiple antigens can generate a more comprehensive antibody response. The present study tested whether SmGtfs can stimulate dual-specific immune responses against both S. mutans and C. albicans. Five rabbits were immunized twice weekly for 7 to 8 months with one of five types of SmGtfs without adjuvant. After the last immunization, all the rabbits showed high serum IgG levels against both S. mutans (11.0% of maximal responses) and C. albicans (15.6%). The binding activity to each antigen was measured by a microarray assay, and sera from four of the five rabbits revealed high binding activity to either antigen. In addition, the antibodies showed a strong binding specificity to multiple strains of S. mutans and C. albicans. Antisera could inhibit glucan synthesis by S. mutan. These results suggest that SmGtfs might be an ideal candidate to study the potential for cross-protection between C. albicans and S. mutans.<EOD> 10-Hydroxycamptothecin combined with temozolomide inhibits murine leukemia cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo\nThe anticancer drug 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) blocks DNA topoisomerase I, leading to cancer",

Relationship between virological and serological markers.\nThe prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and HIV-noninfected subjects was studied by means of a polymerase chain reaction. The overall frequency of HCV infection in 59 HIV-infected patients was 63%; 12 of the 59 HIV-infected patients (20.3%) displayed serological evidence of previous HCV infection, and 22 (37.3%) had positive HCV RNA sequences. The rate of HCV infection among HIV-infected patients was similar to that found in HIV-noninfected controls, and HIV markers did not correlate with HCV markers. In 9 patients with a positive HIV-1 culture or a positive blood test, HCV infection was more frequent among patients with chronically depressed lymphocyte counts, and no correlation was found between HCV and HIV RNA titers. A close follow-up is necessary to identify and to monitor new cases of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients. Moreover, further studies on hepatitis C are needed to determine whether all patients with chronically depressed lymphocyte counts are infected with HCV or with HIV itself.<EOD> Genetic Evidence for a Function of Vav in T\u2010Cell Receptor Signaling1\nVav is a nonreceptor tyros",

Methods: A two-stage approach was developed based on the fact that the liver is often in the center most of the time during liver DCE-MRI. In the first stage, the whole image was first divided into one or more sectors by the center point and the center line defined in the 3D image sequence using the maximum likelihood criterion and dynamic programming. In the second stage, each image was segmented following the segmented sectors of the previous stage by dynamic programming with the following dynamic information, which is much more informative compared to the static feature as used in previous dynamic programming approaches. To speed up the segmentation computation, an efficient strategy was developed to compute the dynamic information in advance. Results: Ten MR data sets acquired from four subjects were used to test the performance of the proposed segmentation method. The proposed method showed very good agreement and stability with manual segmentation; the average Dice coefficients were 90%. The total segmentation time of each 3D image was about 30 s and the whole segmentation process of 10 data sets per subject takes about 40 minutes of computing time. Conclusions: The proposed method shows competitive or better performance than other published methods and, therefore, is efficient and may become a new tool in large-scale clinical studies.<EOD> Nutritional Strategies for the Management of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease\nAbstract: The prevalence of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) ranges from 25% in patients with normal serum creatinine concentrations to >90% in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients who undergo hemodialysis.

Impact of Different Staphylococci Strain and Phytochemical Composition of Honey on Wound Healing in In Vivo Animal Models.Abstract: Staphylococci play an important role in skin injury-related diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of honey-containing phytochemicals as well as different staphylococci strains on different mechanisms involved in wound healing. Experiments were carried out on 40 male white rats with a body mass of 200-225 g. The studied parameters included tissue weight, tissue water content, tissue protein content as well as enzyme activity and concentration in blood serum. Statistically significant results were obtained for protein content (p < 0.05) and activity of TNA (p < 0.05) when comparing the control group with the groups treated with the following strains: SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4, SA391 and SA598, as well as when comparing strains SA598 and SA598 + honey (p < 0.05). A significant difference (p < 0.05) was also shown in the enzyme activity of \u03b1-amylase between the control group and the group infected by SA598 + honey. In turn, when comparing the group infected by SA598, a statistically significant difference was found in enzyme activity of TNA (p < 0.05), while the highest value of the \u03b1-amylase activity was detected in the animals infected by SA1, SA4, SA391 or SA598 (p < 0.05). The results showed that treatment with honey-containing phytochemicals stimulated wound healing against the background of staphylococci infection.

Thus, these findings are suggestive of a differential cytokine/CRP response pattern to a social instruction in adult life according to early life environment. Longitudinal assessments on the long-term effects of these different responses to stress on the health status of adults is needed.<EOD> An update on gastric myeloproliferative neoplasms\nPurpose of review Gastric myeloproliferative neoplasm (MGPM) is an unusual type of primary gastric cancer that is rare globally. This review summarizes the latest updates regarding the diagnosis and management of gastric MGPM. Recent findings Although recent publications on the clinicopathological characteristics have identified some distinctive features of this entity, no consensus has emerged about the classification, histology, or even the nomenclature of this type of primary gastric tumors. The prognosis for patients with gastric MGPM is poor, and curative resection is usually impossible. In addition, this uncommon tumor shows a high degree of chemoresistance, and adjuvant chemotherapy is not beneficial for these patients.

The leaves and flowers of these two species could not be distinguished based on morphological characters. A molecular identification was achieved using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1) in the nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence (nrDNA). The molecular identification was confirmed by a single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) between Pterostemon species from south Sinai, Egypt. Moreover, a genetic study of Pterostemon species was conducted using the nuclear low-copy genes of matK, trnH-PAB and rps14. Our results showed that the genetic diversity of Pterostemon species did not differ significantly, whereas the genetic diversity of Acanthophyllum was higher due to the presence of three haplotypes. Thus, Acanthophyllum species represent the largest genetic variability. These results emphasize the importance of utilizing the molecular markers for identifying difficult plant groups.\n\n# Introduction\nThe genus Acanthophyllum Roth and the genus Pterostemon Cass. belong to the family Asteraceae, which comprises the largest family of plants with a cosmopolitan distribution . Members of the genera Acanthophyllum and Pterostemon are typically used as vegetables for human consumption and are known to cause digestive disorders, including colic, abdominal pain and diarrhea. In addition, these plants act as poisonous phytotoxins to grazing animals leading to liver toxicity when consuming any of the available local crops .\nRecently, the use of morphology for plant taxonomic studies, especially in genera and species, became a controversial issue, in part due to the low reliability, inconsistency and variable results. Therefore, molecular-based approach using the interspecific gene variations could be utilized for determining the true classification, relationships between various plant species, molecular systematics and genetic divers",

In this problem, the Patient-level eligibility requires a clinical trial label and the Trial-level eligibility, which refers to the decision for a certain patient to take part in the clinical trial, requires an assessment value. You have to distinguish them and label them accordingly.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Patient-level eligibility\n\nA good strategy to figure it out is to make use of the label in the dataset, i.e., `label = 1` or `label = 0`. There is only one case with `label = 1` and that is Case 1. It should be determined as `Patient-level eligibility:\n0`.\n\n\n### Trial-level eligibility\n\n\nLet's discuss how to calculate the Trial-level eligibility of every patient. For example, for Patient 5.\n\nThe assessment value is 1, as the condition is fulfilled.\n\nThen the Trial-level eligibility of Patient 5 should be 1 \u00d7 1, which is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other patients and the total should also be 5.\n\n\nFor the last patient, Case 10, there is only the evaluation of assessment 1. So it should be 1 \u00d7 1, which is 1.\n\nTotal should still be 5 and 0.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nPlease submit it via the [submission page](https://submission.ml.cs.cmu.edu/challenge-page/2016/submission.html) (click subit to go straight to 'submit').

Expression of ADAM10 and ADAM17 is developmentally regulated in the nervous system, and these proteases have been implicated in different aspects of neural plasticity. In contrast to ADAM17, which is dispensable for mouse reproduction, mice lacking functional ADAM10 die around birth. The lack of ADAM10 expression causes a severe disorganization of the cortical plate in the developing cerebral cortex. In the retina, the retinal lamination is altered. Moreover, the optic nerve is degenerated, and ganglion cells do not extend axons properly to the optic tectum. ADAM10 deficiency results in a severe loss of olfactory sensory neurons, and the olfactory nerve bundles that contain olfactory sensory neurons reach only a few millimeters in the nasal cavity.

A report from the United Kingdom Type I Diabetes Study Group\nThe risk of non\u2010Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients with Type 1 diabetes (insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM) was investigated prospectively over a 5\u2010year period (1987\u20131991) using population\u2010based data from subjects enrolled in a multicentre, prospective study of the natural history of Type I diabetes in the United Kingdom. A total of 6,936 patients were studied in 39 centres (the United Kingdom Type 1 Diabetes Study Group, UKDTSG). The overall incidence of all NHL was 8.5 per 100,000 patient\u2010years (95% confidence interval 6\u201311 per 100,000 patient\u2010years) compared with a calculated background incidence of 5 per 100,000 patient\u2010years. This was an excess hazard of 83% (95% confidence interval 39\u2013192%) and is a statistically significant excess associated with the study of IDDM as well as with the diagnosis of IDDM per se. The relative risk (RR) of NHL associated with a diagnosis of IDDM was 1.4 (1.2\u20131.7), and the RR associated with the number of years of IDDM diagnosed before the study was 1.2 (1.1\u20131.4).

This intersection between neurobiology and animal welfare is especially salient at the interface between animal agriculture, animal welfare research, and animal use. When designing or evaluating animal use, neurobiologists may have valuable expertise in areas like neural mechanisms of environmental, emotional, and welfare states in various species, perception of the self by animals, memory and learning, and animal behavior. Neurobiology is well recognized as a discipline with important contributions to environmental and ecological research. Neurobiology research related to animal use and animal agriculture commonly targets animals, which may lead to an obligation of the researchers and journals to consider animal welfare in the design and reporting stages of the research process. The neurobiologist may also be uniquely qualified to evaluate published work using animal models as a proxy for human experience or health state.

First, we report that BC and 3-HC induce cell morphological changes, decreasing cell-cell adhesion with the concomitant increase in E-cadherin activity. Since many studies showed that \u03b2-carotene metabolites inhibit carcinogen-mediated tumorigenesis acting as antioxidants and/or modulators of redox homeostasis, the protective effects of BC on E-cadherin activity, measured by fluorescence recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching (FRAP) assay, were evaluated against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and a genetic knockdown of E-cadherin (si-E-cad).

To date, various types of sensors and cough count algorithms have been investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the performance of cough detection by utilizing cough phases and spectral features of cough components. First, we propose a phase-based cough segmentation and feature extraction algorithm to detect the occurrence of cough. The segments are classfied into expiratory and inspiratory components using a multi-level decision-making algorithm and classified into inspiratory and expiratory phases using an inverse cross-correlation based on the time delay (T delay ) estimated on the basis of the inspiratory period (T insp ) and expiratory period (T exp ) of the subject. Thereafter, six spectral features from the signal envelope and four from the power spectrum are extracted for each segment. The classification performance was evaluated using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers designed using four different feature sets. The experimental results show that the algorithm can successfully detect cough and estimate the cough phase of the subject, leading to an increase in the classification accuracy of SVM classifiers of about 68.45% (in term of area under the curve -AUC) against the previous work.

These polysaccharides are an important component of the cell wall in these Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria. Several mutant strains lacking structural O antigen have been constructed by insertion of a resistance cassette at rfb-1 (UCS625, UCS417, and UCS451) and rfb-2 (UCS429). Mutation of rfb-1 and rfb-2 abolished the structural O antigens in several L. monocytogenes strains, including 10403S and 10408S, yet rfb-1 mutants were found to share almost identical properties with the parent strains during all stages of infection in mice. Compared to wild-type bacteria, the O antigen of 10403S is dispensable during the bacterium-host interaction and does not participate in bacterial internalization by J774.1 cells or in the resistance of L. monocytogenes to phagocytosis by neutrophils. However, it is possible that bacteria lacking O antigen may have more potential to bind serum. The rfb-1 and rfb-2 mutants showed identical characteristics to the respective parent strain during intravenous, oral, or intragastric infection of mice. Intravenous injection of the mutant strains induced a lower level of specific anti-O antigen antibody than did the parent stra",

CDSS system aims to improve the quality of health care for the patient, the doctor, and the institution overall.\n\nIn this exercise, we train a CDSS for patient eligibility with a data set. We use the [AWS SageMaker Notebook](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), where a notebook is used to run our machine learning code directly in AWS. Then, a [deployment script](https://github.com/shanghang/CDSS/blob/master/Deployment/CDSSdeploy.ipython) to install the application at EC2 instance, on which the code is developed.\n\n## Initial Configuration (Step0) [13]\nThe following actions should be taken on AWS:\n1.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions that may affect trial compliance, safety, and outcome. In this case, the patient is a 27 yo male patient and does not fit the trial's inclusion criteria: female. He also has cancer. The trial may not include cancer patients.\n\n### Task 2 ###\nIn the figure below, this patient meets three inclusion criteria and does not meet one: age >= 18 yo, and past medication, past treatment, past operation. However, this is the patient's note. There are no data on the current medications and past treatments. However, we can guess that this patient takes anti-hypertensive",

We can see the trials that do not include one criterion as well since the probability is for one patient and any one trial_Inclusion criteria. The formula that gives us the probability that a person enrolls the trial is:\n\n$$P^{el}=\\sum_{k}P^{el,k}$$\nwhere:\n$P^{el,k}$ is the probability that a person enrolls the trial with the trial_Inclusion criteria $k$.\nLet's define the following variables:\n$P^{el}$ is the sum of the probabilities when one or more of the criteria are met:\n$$P^{el}=\\sum_{m}P^{el,m}P^{el,m,j}$$\nThe probability of a person",

Objectives To present a new methodology for evaluating the quality of hospital discharge letters, in a pilot application on 402 discharge letters using a Delphi technique in conjunction with the opinion of the experts. Method The Delphi technique was used to analyze the items proposed by 10 experts in the subject. To carry out the survey, we designed an electronic questionnaire applied in two rounds, containing items organized into four domains. The evaluation of the application and the elaboration of the results was in a final meeting between experts. The questionnaire was applied to 153 participants in the first round while in second round the sample was composed of 402 participants. Results There was significant concordance in 46 items proposed by the experts. The Delphi technique contributed to the refinement of these items. In the final meeting all items were accepted. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to have employed the Delphi technique to evaluate the quality of hospital discharge letters using the opinion of the experts, allowing for the optimization of the clinical contents and of the presentation of this document for future actions such as the monitoring of hospital discharge processes and patient safety.<EOD> A pilot study to evaluate the safety of the anticancer drugs mitomycin C and docetaxel (Taxotere) in patients with advanced cancer.\nAIM\nDocetaxel and other taxanes are commonly used for the treatment of lung, breast, and prostate cancers.

Endoscopic treatment stops bleeding in those actively bleeding from their peptic ulcers, reduces further bleeding, transfusion, surgery and deaths. After initial endoscopic control of bleeding, approximately 10% of them will develop recurrent bleeding. Mortality rate in this group of patients is at least 4 fold higher. In the few who need surgery, mortality approaches 30%. Prevention of further bleeding is therefore a major treatment objective. Currently the investigators use a high dose infusion of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 72 hours to render gastric pH neutral. In a previous randomized trial, the investigators showed that the rate of bleeding in 30 days was around 7% with such an approach. In a small subgroup of high risk patients defined by presentation with shock and ulcers > 2 cm in size, 1 in 6 would re-bleed. An alternate strategy is to select those at especially high risk of further bleeding and repeat endoscopic treatment the next morning. The investigators have shown that persistence of major bleeding stigmata, i.e. a visible vessel, during a second endoscopy predicts further bleeding. It is therefore logical that by repeating endoscopic treatment the next morning, the investigators can prevent further bleeding and possibly surgery and deaths. The current study proposes to develop a score to identify those at risk of further ble",

In a short time, a series of techniques have been developed for measuring chromatin conformation in live cells or tissues. Recent studies using Hi-C and single-cell Hi-C demonstrated the intriguing discovery that the folding of the entire genome is largely maintained across developmental stages.

The latter result led him to propose the concept of \"nuclear compartmentalization\" since a functional and/or regulatory context was not present. These intriguing results challenged the prevalent notion of chromatin as linear material with a nucleosome consisting of DNA wrapped around an octamer composed of four H2A histones and two each of the H2B, H3, and H4 histones. The nuclear compartmentalization could have explained activation-deactivation effects observed on genes and introduced a new idea for \"functional\" and/or \"regulatory\" organization of the genome, which is organized hierarchically, by functional domains.

The title and abstract should appear as follows:AbstractThe aim was to ascertain the distribution of stones based on their composition and location, and to evaluate the effects of age and sex on the size and distribution of urinary tract calculi. 1241 patients with urinary tract calculi were prospectively enrolled in this trial from 2011 to 2013. The stones were separated into three general categories: calculi of simple composition, calculi of multiple compound compositions and calculi of unusual compound composition. The calculi were distributed and accumulated and the correlation between these factors and age and sex were analyzed. Most of the simple and multipie compound stones were composed of calcium oxalate, while the calculi composed of unusual compound compositions were composed mainly of cystine. These calculi had different distributions. Calcium oxalate calculi were most commonly located in the renal calyces, cystine calculi were located mainly in the vesicles, and uric acid calculi were located mainly in both the bladder and renal calyces. The uric acid stones were most common in elderly patients (>50 years old), whereas the number of calculi made of the elements calcium phosphate and oxalate was greater in younger patients. Calcium oxalate stones accounted for more than 60% of single-component calculi and for 70% of multi-component calculi. The number of calculi with unusual compound compositions was lower in elderly patients. In females, the number of calculi made of calcium phosphate was higher, while the number of calculi composed of calcium oxalate was much lower in the bladder compared with that in males. This study demonstrates that different compound compositions contribute to the different distributions of urinary calculi, and that the number of simple and multipie compound stones differs with age",

It has affected the mental well-being of individuals in various ways, with pregnant and parenting populations being exposed to greater anxiety. This is important as pre-and post-natal mental health affects both the outcomes of mothers and their children. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyse and synthesise data from research articles on the stress and anxiety of pregnant women and mothers with newborns exposed to COVID-19. Methods: A search was conducted from 3 December 2019 (the month when the first COVID-19 cases were officially reported) to 3 December 2020. Search engines used included PubMed and Google Scholar. The search terms included \"COVID-19\" AND \"pregnant\" OR \"pregnancy\" OR \"gestation\" OR \"antenatal\" OR \"perinatal\" OR \"postnatal\" OR \"postpartum\" OR \"newborns\" OR \"birth\" OR \"motherhood\". This resulted in 406 articles which were further screened to obtain 24 articles for data extraction. Results: Among the articles that met the criteria, 75% of the studies were quantitative and the majority (73%) were cross-sectional. One of the cross-sectional studies reported high prevalence (23.4%) of stress and depression during pregnancy during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak.

These new G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptors bind neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY) in a subtype\u2010specific manner, with Y1 being activated by NPY; Y2 and Y5 being activated by both NPY and PYY, whereas Y3 is activated by the pancreatic polypeptide. Previously, we demonstrated that Y2 receptors are localized mainly on sensory afferent nerve endings in the lamina I of the spinal cord. The aim of the present study was to characterize the contractile effects of Y receptor activation in isolated mouse mesenteric arteries. 1 \u03bcm dipeptide YY (DPYY), a Y2\u2010 and Y5\u2010agonist, and 100 nm NPY, a Y1\u2010and Y2\u2010agonist, produced a concentration\u2010dependent inhibition of phenylephrine\u2010induced and KCl\u2010induced contractions. These contractile responses to KCl, but not those to phenylephrine, were also inhibited by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226. 1 \u03bcm NPY produced a contraction only in preparations which were pretreated with 0.1 \u03bcm atropine. The agonist\u2010induced contractions, which were mediated via the Y1 receptor (NPY\u2010) and the Y2 receptor (NPY/DPYY), were inhibited by 0.1 \u03bcm BIBP3226. In conclusion, these results show that NPY may release peptides belonging to the Y family in the vasculature and these peptides may contribute to regulating vascular tone.<EOD> .\nOn the",

Patients having the same level of clinical efficiency for the three groups were also investigated in order to define the factors which increase the risk of ototoxicity. All the newborns developed a proven or suspected septicaemia following respiratory distress syndrome, and had pneumonia which required the administration of aminogylcoside. The three groups of patients did not show any significant differences regarding the clinical outcome. A good correlation was found between the risk of ototoxicity and the daily amount of aminogylcoside administered, when this amount was above 4 mg/kg/d. At least a part of the ototoxicity appeared as directly related to this amount. This study suggests the following: a) G may be administered with confidence at 5 mg/kg/d in the event of proven septicaemia. When antibiotic association is required, the combination G+A+T has the best effect regarding the risk of ototoxicity, b) aminogylcosides administration should be kept under close medical surveillance, and c) it is essential to define the factors influencing this administration.<EOD> The prognosis of the perineum in women who had a caesarean section\nAbstract Objective: To determine the degree of complications that can be avoided by a vaginal examination during the perineum recovery period.

Background: The success of hearing preservation after cochlear implantation has been studied in an increasing number of patients with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). The hearing preservation CI has proven to be an effective treatment option in these patients. The success of the implant in hearing preservation CI patients with ANSD has been associated with factors such as age, bilateral profound deafness, and ossification of the cochlea. We studied several factors that may impact hearing preservation in CI patients with ANSD. Methods: The study cohort comprised of patients with hearing preservation CI and ANSD. Patients were classified into either having complete (no measurable preoperative responses) or incomplete ANSD (measurable preoperative responses). Using binary logistic regression analysis, we analyzed three prognostic factors: age, bilateral profound deafness, and the ossified cochlea. We found that the ossified cochlea remained a good predictor. We further studied the role of the presence of the ossified basal turn (BT) of the cochlea in predicting the final outcome in such patients. Results: Fifty-nine patients were included. The average age was 7.51 \u00b1 0.85 yrs, and the average duration of deafness was 1.35 \u00b1 2.89 yrs. The preoperative ABG was 45.19 \u00b1 10.90. The average duration of the surgery was 132.79 \u00b1 36.88 mins. Eighteen patients (30.5%) presented bilateral ANSD, while the remaining presented with unilateral ANSD.

We now know the answer to our question ``What the heck should our students learn before taking the Assistant of Clinical Research program?`` In this chapter, we learned:\n1. In our training/career path from the assistant of clinical research to senior medical staff member in medical research team, we have to learn to analyze complex problems, conduct trials, and make decisions on patients carefully and wisely.\n2. When starting a new job, we have to understand the current medical field in general. \n3. We have to learn to work with a team. \nThe following lessons will train us to deal with such problems.\n\n### Medical Statistic and Biostatics\n\nStatistics have been very popular since the beginning of scientific journals and have been part of medical research practice. This popularity is partially due to a large variety of statistical tests being available for each research result from a range of data sources.\n\nWhen we deal with complex biomedical problems, we need to use many sorts of statistics, statistical inference methods, and statistical models. Furthermore, we often do not understand the principles of statistics, and thus, cannot evaluate them to draw conclusions. Because of the importance of statistics in a medical research environment, it is essential for us to learn the concepts and theories of statistics when we choose the appropriate statistical methods.\n\nStatistics can be a very complicated subject to understand; therefore, we should take a class in statistics and learn how to apply specific statistics to a clinical research. Here, we need to learn both basic and advanced statistics and biostatistics. Even after completing this class, there might be problems to which we do not know an answer. We can then learn by trial and error. If we want, we can search in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Trial Statistics and Biostatistics (CTSB) web pages or textbooks to solve these problems.\n\n### Ethics\n\nEthics is a field of study concerned with what makes actions morally right and wrong. It encompasses not only the analysis of an action's meaning, but also of its relationship to moral laws and principles.\n\nThe role",

Surveys of school students in the United States (US) and Europe reported menorrhagia in 37% to 55% of adolescent females. Medical management of adolescent menorrhagia includes various formulations of hormonal therapy and the antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid. Oral tranexamic acid (TA), a more potent antifibrinolytic agent used as standard therapy for menorrhagia in adult women and in adolescent women in Europe and Canada, was not previously available in the US. Subsequent to US FDA approval in November 2009 of a novel oral TA formulation to treat cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding in adult women, this medication is currently included in the treatment armamentarium for adult menorrhagia. There is currently no preliminary data available in the US about the clinical use of oral TA in an exclusive adolescent population with menorrhagia. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are considered standard therapy in the management of menorrhagia in teenaged women. Oral TA has been shown to be more efficacious than progesterone-only hormonal therapy for menorrhagia in adult women. However, there is no data available comparing",

Caregivers have a major role in monitoring HC consumers, enabling health assessments to be used to better identify potential problems and monitor clients over time, ensuring the continuity of care. However, the health assessment used by HC staff and the HC consumer/informal caregiver has not been examined. Objectives: To describe the most commonly used health assessment tools, including a comparative analysis of the tools used by HC providers and caregivers. Design: Scoping review. Methods: Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to June 2019. Studies that examined a health assessment tool or scale completed by both HC providers and caregivers, or a proxy report of client health from a primary caregiver, were included. Narrative synthesis was the primary method of analysis. Results: Forty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-four studies examined the reliability and validity of measures; however, a small number examined sensitivity (HC providers: n = 2; caregivers: n = 3) and correlations (HC providers: n = 2; caregivers: n = 1). Measurement instruments used for screening, assessment, and management of health for HC consumers included tools that focused on functional performance, safety, falls, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In contrast, tools used by caregivers included assessments of activities of daily living, safety, falls, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and health-related quality",

The findings provide useful information about the factors that influence decisions relating to policy strategies in these countries, and show how evidence influences these strategies. The study was undertaken as part of a multi\u2010European\u2010centre study, funded by the European Union, on the use of evidence and research in food\u2010 and nutrition\u2010based public health policy and programme development. Results from this study suggest that the availability of evidence on nutrition and health for many public health projects in Europe remains inadequate; however, where evidence is available many governments continue to base policy on this, although often with considerable delays or without fully understanding any available evidence. For many countries the policy process remains opaque; in some countries the extent to which the process is transparent is unknown. This represents a threat to trust as the public remain unaware of policy development procedures which might affect their health and the health of their families. Increasing the transparency of policy development processes through the application of the Nuffield Principals is likely to be beneficial in promoting the public's trust in government. These principles emphasise the need for policy\u2010makers to: provide the public with adequate information on policy development to make informed decisions; be accountable to the public; and be committed to promoting the health and well\u2010being of the public. The results from this study suggest that many European countries would benefit from the application of these principles of policy development as they are likely to promote transparency and accountability between policy\u2010makers and the public.<EOD> Synaptic mechanisms of sleep and arousal.\n1.

A vascular component of highly aggressive HCC has been characterized by the presence of tumor cords with a central capillary lined by endothelial cells (ECs) at different stages of maturation. We here provide an in-depth characterization of the endothelial phenotype of HCC in order to better understand its tumor spreading ability. Immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry were used for the characterization of the endothelial phenotype in \u223c200 HCC tissues. A fraction of endothelium-specific markers in tumor cord\u2013associated endothelial cells with a strong proangiogenic phenotype were detected. In particular, we showed the expression of VE-cadherin (CDH5) protein in the tumor cord\u2013associated endothelium of HCC and its increased expression in HCC tumors. Moreover, we showed that the high level of CDH5 expression in human HCC tissues was associated with reduced overall survival. We further investigated the implication of CDH5 in the tumor cord formation during HCC progression by evaluating its level in tumor cell lines. We show that CDH5 is involved in endothelial differentiation and tumor cord formation through its role in cell\u2013cell adhesion. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the endothelial phenotype is a hallmark of highly aggressive HCCs and that CDH5 is a candidate factor driving tumor cord formation in HCC. Our results could be used to better understand the aggressive properties of HCC and thereby contribute to finding novel targets for antiangiogenic therapies.<EOD> The Influence of Psychosocial and Health-Related Factors on Self-Reported and Actigraphy-Based Sleep Trajectories in Older Adults.\nBackground\nAdequate sleep duration is essential for optimal functioning, yet a",

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort was conducted for patients admitted to two hospitals in China. 1360 patients with COVID-19 from 30 th January to 9 th April, 2020 were included. Severe COVID-19 patients were defined as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation, shock or multi-organ system dysfunction. The critically ill patients were classified as critical ill (CI) or critically dead (CD). ARDS was characterized by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 below 300 mmHg. Acute respiratory injury was defined if a patient had any of the following criteria: (i) respiratory frequency \u2265 30 breaths per minute; (ii) oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/inspiratory fraction of oxygen, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) \u2264 300; (iii) pulmonary infiltrates in more than one-third of the hemithorax on chest x-ray. The data of 1349 patients who were successfully followed up was analyzed. We used \u03c7 2 tests or t-tests to detect significant differences in clinical variables among patients with or without severe or critical illness. Logistic regression was carried out with a generalized linear model to determine prognostic factors associated with 30-day mortality of severe and critical patients with COVID-19. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

It has been selected for preclinical investigations because of its very good safety ratio on reproductive organs and other target organs (skeleton, bones, liver, prostate, kidney) in animals and its powerful anti-hormonal activity. LY607211 was administered alone or in combination with a dihydrotestosterone treatment on the prostate of orchidectomized rats.

In the present study the effects of three different steroids on skin biopsies were examined, as were these effects before and after systemic application of hydrocortisone. Systemic effects do have their limitation, and only on local skin effects are to be expected. The following creams were chosen from the products available in Switzerland: a 0.05% hydrocortison cream (Dermol 5, Roche), a 0.1% betamethason cream (Betnesol N\u00ae, Fisons Pharma) and a 0.04% fluocortin butyrate cream (Lopidone, Boots). The first two creams contain a steroid with high potency, and the third one fluocortin, with medium potency. Biopsies were taken from 32 healthy women and 9 male patients, of whom 5 suffered from atopic diathesis, before starting systemic treatment with hydrocortisone (at a dose of 10 to 50 mg daily). After the onset of treatment a second biopsy was taken, and the 3rd one six weeks later. In the biopsies taken, an increased epidermal proliferation was seen in 12 of the 27 women and 3 of the 4 men. In 5 cases local side effects were found: 2 patients developed burning; 2 an impairment of the skin barrier; and",

A 13-mo-old infant who developed hyperthyroidism associated with Graves' disease was shown to have significant aminoaciduria, mild hypokalemia, and increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels. The hyperthyroid state remitted spontaneously within 6 wk. The urinary aminoacid excretion also normalized, but the alkaline phosphatase level was increased on subsequent followup. These results suggest that aminoaciduria as well as hypokalemia might occur in cases of nontoxic hypo-hyperthyroidism in infants.<EOD> Osteosarcoma presenting in an ovarian cystic teratoma\nBackground: A female adolescent presented with a large cystic mass in the abdomen. Radiologically, the lesion was inseparable from the ovary and histologically, it was a malignant ovarian teratoma. There were no radiological or clinical features, typical of malignancies in ovarian cystic teratomas. Materials and Methods: The tumour was surgically removed and the mass was sent for cytological examination. Results and Conclusion: Cytological and histopathological examination revealed that the mass was an ovarian dermoid cyst with osteosarcoma. This is a rare case of osteosarcoma presenting in the ovary. The case is presented because an osteosarcoma as a malignant variant is extremely rare in the ovary. Owing to its rarity, this can easily be missed in diagnosis and this can result in an inappropriate management plan when the patient presents to the surgeon.<EOD> Effect of inhalation toxicity of",

We expected to see acute increases in objective sleepiness and decreases in NREM and sleep spindle activity.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe performed a randomized cross-over experiment on four non-consecutive nights; TSD, light stimulation (light box) and no intervention, in a within-subject design. Thirty-nine cognitively normal subjects (69 to 86 years) were recruited.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS\nTSD and light stimulation significantly decreased subjective sleepiness as measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and by vigilance performance in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. They also led to a smaller amount of non-REM sleep as recorded by PSG. Sleep spindle activity was reduced in both groups, more in the light stimulation group than in the TSD group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that TSD and light stimulation during wakefulness in older subjects have largely opposite effects on subjective sleepiness.

While bone is the most common site for chondrosarcomas, less than 10% of chondrosarcomas originate in the appendicular skeleton. Most of these cases arise in the proximal femur or distal humerus. Multifocal chondrosarcoma is a form of sarcomatous neoplasia in which the tumor consists of two or more foci, all of which are histologically identical. Simultaneous multifocal chondrosarcomas are exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, only two cases of simultaneous multifocal chondrosarcoma of the humerus have been reported. We present a rare case of simultaneous multifocal cartilaginous tumor in the proximal humerus of a 62-year-old man with symptomatic osteoarthritis secondary to developmental dysplasia. Our case represents only the third confirmed primary case of chondrosarcoma of the humerus. The histopathologic analysis of the bone biopsy specimen revealed a high-grade cartilaginous tumor.

In this study, we prepared four types of datasets, with only the first and second datasets being used to build DeepEligibility. This paper describes the generation of the datasets.\n\n## Datasets\nFirst, we obtained the data of 'patients' and 'trials' from PREDDICT project.\n- 'Patients' dataset: For each case, the dataset includes information for gender, age, and a series of test results including complete blood count (CBC), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load, and blood protein levels. \n\n## - \n'Trials' dataset: These are the information summaries for a set of clinical trials approved by PREDDICT project's advisory board. Each 'trial' consists of information for the trial name, trial description, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and research purpose.\nSecond, we added dummy values for the data.\n- For the patient records, we added 'N/A' in all cases where the value was not available, and converted the continuous numerical values to one-hot.\n- For the trial-level data, we replaced several long text strings (in particular, in the description line) with 'N/A'.\n\n## Machine learning training\nThe target output was a three-component vector {eligibility (0, 1, 2), gender, age}, and the inputs were patient's diagnosis report and trial-level data.\nWe trained the multi-output classifier 'DeepEligibility' with the patient data using a convolutional neural network (CNN) because the patient records were images (CBC results).

AHH-1 cells and VA-13 transformants were incubated with AHH-1 TF or TF from adrenal medullary (AM) transfer factor-positive (TF+) or transfer factor-negative (TF-) donors in the presence of 3AB. The results indicated that normal and transformed cells were arrested in G1 phase for approximately 96 h after incubation with normal TF, while only control cells and VA-13 transformant cells incubated with TF+ AM TF were arrested in G1 phase for approximately 72 h after stimulation with 3AB. The arrest of control cells was significantly less than the arrest of AHH-1 cells and VA-13 transformant cells, and the arrest of VA-13 cells was less than the arrest of AHH-1 cells. We conclude that the cell cycle distribution of normal lung cells and transformed hamster lung cells in G1 phase changes with AHH-1 TF.

Recent innovations in stroke therapy have applied motor learning principles to improve motor skills through regular practice of activities using the weaker limb. Because the ankle provides critical torques for normal walking and mobility function, impairments at the affected ankle pose a major limitation to achieving optimal mobility recovery. To address this we have developed a novel ankle robot (Anklebot) to enhance physical therapy for improving walking and mobility after stroke. This computer controlled device provides assistance when users cannot complete a movement, but will not assist if the user is active.~Motor learning requires active involvement in task-related practice to mediate brain plasticity. While voluntary movement is important to remodel motor control circuits, the brain mechanisms of reward and motivation also can play an important role. Core brain networks involved in reward and motivation increase a person's involvement with their surroundings, to focus attention and to prompt one to approach reward and avoid punishment. This increased involvement and the elevated emotions associated with it have been shown to enhance performance, memory and learning.~The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of brain and motor behavior of stroke patients who use the Anklebot during a",

Most clinical reports have been concerned with the interaction of phenytoin, a potent enzyme inhibitor, with certain drugs known to function primarily via the hepatic CYP2C subfamily. However, it is of interest that the CYP2C-specific drug interactions also may be observed with other drugs which are metabolized by enzymes of the CYP2C subfamily because of the similarity of pharmacologic and chemical properties to phenytoin. The enzyme system responsible for the clearance of phenytoin is widely distributed throughout most tissues, including the intestinal walls, liver, kidneys, brain, and placenta, and is expressed mainly in the epithelial cells of these various tissues. Enzymatically, the biotransformation of phenytoin occurs via the degradation of the phosphorylated phenols to produce inactive metabolites, and to a smaller extent via its conjugation with glucuronic acid .<EOD> Repression of hTERT transcription by tax through Sp1 sites.\nThe mammalian telomerase holoenzyme complex (hTERT:human telomerase reverse transcriptase/hTERC:human telomerase RNA component) is regulated by the viral oncoprotein Tax of HTLV-1.

Deficient enzyme activity or mutation in the alpha-galactosidase A gene leads to lysosomal storage of globotriaosylceramide in renal medullary cells and causes nephropathy in adulthood. The disease is highly heterogeneous and clinical symptoms are not correlated with alpha-galactosidase A activity or mutation number. Therefore, the biochemical diagnosis of Fabry disease, such as alpha-galactosidase A activity determination, is of limited value for early diagnosis. Recently, alpha-galactosidase A studies using immunohistochemistry have been suggested as a more practical method.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe studied alpha-galactosidase A in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal tissues using immunohistochemistry for diagnosis of Fabry disease even in the cases with normal levels of alpha-galactosidase A activity in serum and plasma lyophilized dried blood spots.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nSixty-one patients with CKD aged 59 +/- 18 years in mean were enrolled in the study. The levels of the enzyme activity were determined by an enzyme activity assay with p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside as the substrate in serum and plasma lyophilized dried blood spots in 53 and 55 patients, respectively. The alpha-galactosidase A immunohistochemical study was performed in 61 native renal biopsy tissues and in 15 allograft biopsy tissues.

Objective of the study was to find out the association between chronic illness (CI) with the body mass index (BMI) and overweight (OW)/obesity and underweight (UW) in adolescent girls. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 859 girls aged between 10 and 19 years in selected three zones in India. A systematic random sampling approach was used to select the participants. Results: The results revealed that 68.4% of participants were thin, 24.6% were of normal and 6.9% were overweight/obese. Majority of underweight (UW) girls had chronic diseases, like chronic cough and fever, acute jaundice, etc. (24.1%) and other medical conditions like diabetes, joint problems, asthma etc. (20.3%). Conclusion: The present study findings revealed an association of chronic illnesses and BMI status and UW among adolescent girls. These findings are consistent with findings of previous studies where thinness was associated with adverse health outcomes. Adolescence is one of the most crucial phases for growth and development among girls.

Extensive evidence from animal models indicates that the malfunction of these pathways is associated with human disease. In Drosophila, the Wnt pathway regulates wing, muscle and imaginal disc development. Loss-of-function mutations in Wingless (Wg), Daughterless (Da), and Armadillo (Arm) result in adult wing and wing margin defects. The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates organ polarity and segmentation, and affects axial specification, cell proliferation, and cell fate determination that are essential for animal development. In Drosophila, the major components of the Hedgehog pathway, including Hedgehog, Patched (PTC), Smoothened (SMO), Cubitus interruptus and the transcription factor Ci, have evolved from different cellular processes in the multicellular protozoan Trichomonas foetus. Although Drosophila does not harbor any Hedgehog homologue, it does have a patched homologue (ptc). Drosophila ptc has been shown to regulate dorsal-ventral patterning, segmentation, eye development, male differentiation and wing development.

Furthermore, conventional methods generate nanocrystals with a broad range of sizes. As a result of the advancement of nanotechnology, the production of innumerable materials at the nanoscale has resulted. The emerging green synthesis of nanoparticles via biological macromolecules, particularly enzymes, has gained considerable interest over the past few decades. Here, we present an overview of the green synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and nanoclusters employing various biological macromolecules including enzymes, proteins, phytochemicals, fungi, and bacteria. Furthermore, we examine the applications of AuNPs in cancer, tissue engineering, wound healing, dental therapy, and drug delivery, in addition to in other areas such as bioimaging and sensors.

Our goal was to identify nuclear receptors of retinoic acid (RAR and RXR) and investigate their expression in relation with the chondrogenic differentiation of MSC. Total RNA from rabbit bone marrow and expanded rabbit MSC grown in a monolayer, or under induction of differentiation, were analyzed using differential display. Differential expression of six transcripts was detected. A 490 bp cDNA sequence, hereafter referred to as RAR, was found to be strongly expressed in uninduced MSC, and to be downregulated in cells exposed to RA. RAR cDNA was subsequently cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique and the consensus RAR-RXR binding sequence was identified. Using quantitative PCR, RAR expression was found to be downregulated in differentiated MSC with a fold change variation of 0.37. This variation was less severe compared to the change in expression of Indian HedgeHog, a chondrogenic marker. The expression of the other three genes, identified by the differential display technique, was either lower in expression in native mesenchymal cells or induced during chondrogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of MSC differentiation into chondrogenic cells and demonstrate the potential importance of RAR in the early stages in bone marrow development.<EOD> Diatom-based environmental parameters determine the community composition of freshwater sedaibacteria\n\nSupplementary Information S1: Alpha and beta diversity analyses The alphadiversity of the sedaibacteria (sediment + pore water) were calculated with (i) Hill numbers (i.e. the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) + the equitability (also referred to as the Shannon index) and (ii) Chao1 richness estimator.

The microbiome of a given ecosystem can reveal clues about the characteristics of their habitat as well as the health status of the hosts. For instance, alterations in the intestinal microbiome play a role in the pathogenesis of many disorders in humans. As for the respiratory tract, a growing body of evidence is showing a relationship between the composition of pulmonary microbiome and respiratory diseases. This review explains how metagenomic analyses are conducted to characterize the respiratory microbiome. The structure of microbial communities and the dynamics of the respiratory microbiome are also discussed. In addition, we summarize the characteristics of respiratory tract microbiome by disease. Finally, we describe the clinical implications and limitations of studying the microbiome of the respiratory tract.\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Definition of microbiome\nThe term microbiome was first coined in 1998 to describe the collection of genes contained within microorganisms living within an environment, such as human body. Microbiome means something like inhabitants of a habitat. A habitat can be defined as a place or environment in which an inhabitant can live [bib_ref]  Habitat, resource availability and microbial population structure in a microfluidic ecosystem, Eltoukhy [/bib_ref] . According to the definition, the human body, known as human habitat, is considered to be occupied by symbiotic microorganisms that are present in their own habitat, the host, at any time and thus should be described as the microbiome of the human body [bib_ref]  Insights into the role of the human microbiome in maintaining human health..., Cheng [/bib_ref] .",

The identification of such genes has been accelerated using advanced strategies of genetic linkage analysis and association studies. Here we have focused on the genetic susceptibility to primary late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibers and the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles with an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which are the hallmarks of the disease. Familial AD (FAD) represents one of the primary late onset AD cases accounting for about 5% of cases. We first report on the identification of a susceptibility locus on chromosome 11q13 for FAD in Sweden which was detected using a genome-wide search strategy with haplotypes. The region has been extensively analyzed in a second independent Swedish population using both haplotypes and direct marker analyses yielding a genome-wide significant association signal (P=0.00009) at a locus about 0.7 Mb to the 5'-end of D11S1760 (peak marker rs11664391 on chromosome 11; P=3.78x10-4). A second FAD locus on chromosome 18q21-22 was identified in this study which was also confirmed on a second independent Swedish FAD population. Interestingly, this second locus contained a previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 10 of amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. The association was most significant for this SNP (P=1.48x10-7 on chromosome 18) with a locus peak marker flanked by HIC1 and APP (peak marker rs404025 in exon 10 on chromosome 18).

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in four communities in Guangzhou, China. The elderly were interviewed using the Chinese version of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pain Index. The NIH Pain Questionnaire was used to describe the pain characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to select potential risk factors for pain among elderly persons in community-based services. Results: A total of 402 elderly persons participated in this study, with a mean age of 78.7 years (standard deviation: 8.3 years). Our study indicated that 79.1% (364/402) of the interviewed participants had experienced pain within the six months before examination, and 44% (178/402) of the participants had chronic pain.

A maximum of 75 people with secondary progressive MS will be included.\n-Each patient will be followed for 12 months.\n-Domperidone is a medication which has been shown to increase levels of the hormone prolactin. The best understood function of prolactin is the stimulation of milk production in women after delivery. However, the increase in prolactin levels seen in patients treated with standard doses of Domperidone (in doses of up to 80mg per day) usually does not lead to clinical symptoms. Prolactin has been shown to improve myelin repair in mice. Domperidone therefore may also improve myelin repair in people with MS. Domperidone is currently approved in Canada to treat slow moving bowels and nausea, for instance in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Diabetes Mellitus, where too slowly moving bowels can cause constipation. Domperidone is available as a tablet that is usually taken four times per day. Doses up to 80mg per day may be used but we estimate that a dose of only 40mg daily will be needed to stimulate myelin repair. Domperidone is usually well tolerated.\n-Inclusion Criteria:",

When added to the apical side of the frog skin, amiloride exhibited a dose-dependent depression of the rate of short-circuit current. The effect was observed within 2-3 s after drug addition and reached a maximum 5 s after it. The concentration dependent inhibitory effect, in the concentration range used, was parallel to each of the concentration dependent action of amiloride on sodium and chloride transport separately. However, the concentration dependence of the inhibitory effect of amiloride showed a less steep slope than the dependence of the apparent affinity of amiloride, indicating that the inhibitory effect of amiloride may not be completely explained by the simple competive interaction of amiloride and sodium under the present experimental conditions. The inhibition ratio for the rate of sodium transport to the rate of chloride transport in the tissue (INa/ICl) may be a quantitative parameter of the inhibitory effect of the drug. The INa/ICl value was independent of the inhibitory effect on sodium transport with the present concentration range of the drug, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of amiloride on chloride transport is not directly related to the action on sodium transport. The INa/ICl value showed a parallel concentration dependence against the inhibitory effect of amiloride on the rate of sodium transport. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of amiloride on sodium transport is mainly caused by its action on the sodium transport which occurs in the apical membrane, although the possibility can not be completely excluded that the action occurs in another part of the membrane. The addition of amiloride to the basolateral side of the skin tissue was without any significant effect on the rate of short-circuit current whereas amiloride appeared to penetrate the skin tissue.<EOD> The Coding Strategy of PAR1-Activated Protein Kinase 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\nBackground: Prototype foamy virus (PFV) is the sole known representative of Gammaretro",

The use of larger volume containers reduces this decay to insignificant amounts. 13-HPOD and 1,3-dithiol-2-thione adducts, formed by the auto-oxidation of linoleic acid, were studied in plasma samples collected by venipuncture or by fingerstick. Plasma samples from control subjects, as well as samples from subjects at elevated risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), were studied. A method is presented for estimating levels of peroxy fatty radicals in plasma by the quantitation of the levels of their corresponding thioether adducts. This method could be utilized where levels of hydroperoxy fatty acids are required during clinical studies.<EOD> Sweet's syndrome-like neutrophilic dermatosis in a case of atopic dermatitis.\nTo the Editor.\u2014 Sweet's syndrome is a nonpyoderma, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis clinically similar to cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Histologically it is characterized by a dense neutrophilic dermal infiltrate and leukocytoclasis. Several recent reports have noted similar cutaneous findings in patients who had underlying hematologic malignancies (1,2). We describe a case of atopic",

        "output": "We have already done most work from the template. To generate a trial-level eligibility, all we need to do is to modify the last line before putting `Trial-level eligibility:` as we have shown the template. However, before you modify it, you need to know how to get the patient note.\nThe patient note is displayed in the form of a string. You can get access to it from `Patient` object using `documents` attributes. `documents` is stored as a dictionary of `dict_of` object, which stores its contents as a string. To get the patient note, first modify the 'title' to be 'patient_note' in `clinical_study`. Then, use the patient object you had in your previous work. In our example, the code to get all the information about a patient in a dict variable `patient_info` would be the following:\n\nimport utils\n\nclinical_study_patient_info = utils.load_patient_data()\n\nHere is a sample result:\npatient_note = clinical_study_patient_info.documents['patient_note']\n\nNow, before we can show the patient note, we have to convert the string to a list. As mentioned earlier, a string is saved as a string with several comma separated fields. Each individual field with no comma will store as a string within the string. The patient note contains a comma, and we can extract only the fields that follow the comma separated by extracting the comma separated data and converting them to a list in the next line. The following block of code would do it.\n\npatient_note = patient_note.replace(\",\", \", \").split(\", \")\n\nThen, we convert it into a list of two-dimensional arrays with rows as a single patient information and columns are a string in text form. It would look like the following:\npatient_note = patient_note[0].tolist()\n\nThere is a method that helps you iterate through these single strings. Before you go to the method `TextParser`, you must load a parser that can read the csv format. If you are using pandas, you can use pandas.DataFrame in one simple line of code:\n\npd.read_csv('data.csv', header=0)\n\nBefore using textparser, it",

The UMLS semantic network is widely used to measure the semantic similarity between medical terms. Because it uses the domain knowledge of the medical field, it is natural to use UMLS for medical text analysis. Each semantic concept in UMLS has two main sets of semantic relations: semantic types and relations. Semantic types describe the semantic meaning of a concept, while relations provide information about the associations between concepts. The semantic relatedness between two concepts depends on the semantic types of their common ancestors and common associates. The semantic relatedness is measured using the semantic network similarity.\n\nThe semantic network similarity of two concepts A and B is expressed as:\n\n|    `    `    `    |    `    `    |    `    `    |    `    `    |    `    `    |    `    `    |    |    `    `    |    |       \n|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   \n|     |    |     |    |    |    |     |    |      |    |    |     |    |     |    |     \n|     |    |     |     , ,  ,|   , , |   , ,|     , ,",

        "output": "## Clinical trials\n\n# Introduction\nThere has been a dramatic rise in interest in clinical trials by oncology investigators since the NIH initiated the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) program in the 1970s. In August 2000, a workshop entitled \u201cTranslating Clinical Oncology Research into Practice: The Next Frontier\u201d was held to reassess the state of clinical investigations in oncology. Participants in this meeting suggested that CTEP should be renamed the Clinical Trials Support System to reflect the increasingly wide and varied scope of CTEP support of clinical trials in oncology. Numerous organizations have devoted effort to defining what is required for a trial to be defined as a clinical trial. \nThe term 'trial' is often used to describe 'studies'. Studies on human subjects can be observational or interventional. \nObservational studies are not a prospective study of a question of interest (interventional study) but involve passive evaluation of a population. Interventional studies differ, because they are designed to prospectively answer a question or hypothesis (test a hypothesis). \nObservational studies may include clinical trials to study a population. \nClinical trials include controlled trials, with randomized and non-randomized controlled clinical trials. \nRandomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involve controlled allocation of participants to an experimental or control group using randomization (random allocation of participants to treatment groups).\nControlled clinical trials include 'true' 'blinded' trials, in which the researchers are unaware of the group to which the participant has been allocated and is unaware of the treatment received by the participant.\n\n## Randomized controlled trial\n- The randomization of research participants into several groups, one of which is the control group. The randomization is important to provide unbiased comparables and make it impossible to guess the group to which a participant will be allocated.\n- Candidates for a disease prevention trial should generally be individuals without symptoms or signs of the disease who do not have metabolic or physical abnormalities (e.g., liver disease, impaired kidney function, severe osteoporosis",

When a photon is absorbed by an electron in an atom, molecule or macromolecule, the electron can change states from its ground states into a higher energy excited state. The decay process of that excited state of an electron can lead to the emission of a single photon. \nTranscription. Transcription of a DNA can lead to RNA strand having a specific sequence of nucleotides. The DNA can be transcribed by molecules such as RNA polymerase and the nucleotides from this RNA strand can be decrypted to produce various polypeptides in the cytoplasm during translation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Excitation-transcription coupling.\nIt was first noticed in the 1960s that when a specific transcript is overproduced, the promoter driving the gene expression will be remapped by an eraser called transcription suppressor. This remapping happens at a lower frequency of transcription when the promoter is not transcribed, but becomes more abundant at the promoter when the mRNA strand is transcribed. This process is called excitation-transcription coupling feedback, where a gene that is transcribed will result in an eventual excitation that will cause the promoter to be transcribed more than it was initially.\n\nThis property was first used when researching the genetic code of life. Through these excitations and transcription, the code's DNA template will replicate to produce a higher copy number of specific amino acids and polypeptides for DNA replication. This is the concept of biocomputations.\n\nA single gene may not code for a certain amino acid for protein synthesis, but a combination of genes in a prom",

We explored this novel role, examining whether Gal8 affects in vitro adipogenesis and insulin signaling and in vivo insulin sensitivity. Methods and Results\u2014The effects of Gal8 on the adipogenic potential were examined by using the differentiation of stromal ST2 cells and the human primary stromal cell subpopulation containing preadipocytes. Galectin-8 increased glucose uptake, insulin signaling, and insulin sensitivity in stromal cell lines and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Exogenously added Gal8 (i) stimulated adiponectin secretion by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, ii) decreased expression of proadipogenic factors such as phospho-SMAD3, C/EBP-&dgr;, and adipogenic transcription factors such as C/EBP-&agr; and -&bgr; and peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor &ggr; (PPAR&ggr;), and iii) abrogated insulin-induced pErk, with effects that were reproduced in 3T3-L1 cells by lentiviral overexpression of recombinant soluble Gal8. Finally, we demonstrated that Gal8 administered to mice in combination with high-fat diet decreased both epididymal fat pad weight and PPAR&ggr; and C/EBP-&bgr; mRNA expression in epididymal fat.
