The central hypothesis to be tested by this project is that oxidative stress is a major (and modifiable) trigger for vascular access complications.

Fever is the cardinal manifestation of FMF and is present in most attacks accompanied by abdominal pain. Another clinical manifestation in patients with FMF is exertional muscle pain, usually in the thigh, which appears even after minor exercise or physical activity in young patients with generally good health (other than FMF) and in good physical condition. Some patients also complain of ankle edema after relatively minor physical activity, which subsides after a night rest. Although these manifestations are quite common in FM",

However, further investigation is needed to determine if the patient's symptoms are related to a recent infection or underlying medical condition. \n\nNote: This assessment is based on the fact that fever and leukopenia can be signs of an active infection, which may interfere with the immune response to the vaccine. The inclusion criteria for this clinical trial require participants to be flavivirus (FV) non-immune subjects at baseline, and the presence of fever and leukopenia may indicate that the patient has been previously exposed to flaviviruses, which could affect the non-inferiority of the immune response to the yellow fever vaccine. Therefore, it is recommended to consider referring the patient to a different clinical trial that is more appropriate for his current health status. However, further investigation is needed to confirm the patient's FV status and the cause of his symptoms before making a final decision.</s>",
