Based on the description of this patient's clinical information and the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial, my assessment of the patient's eligibility for the trial is a score of 2, meaning that the patient is eligible for the trial. The reasoning behind this assessment is as follows. The patient's age (46 years) falls within the range specified in the inclusion criteria of the trial, 30 to 70 years old. The patient's neck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. This patient also exhibits severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery, which is within the range specified in the criteria of the clinical trial, which is significant stenosis (\u2265 50-70%) of at least one carotid artery. Additionally, for the left internal carotid artery, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively, and for the right internal carotid artery, the PSV was 91.72 cm/s and the EDV was 37.37 cm/s.

        "output": "In order to perform a clinical trial recruitment task using the FAIR principles as instructed in the training, it is important to follow a few basic steps. First, the patient document in question is provided, which is called the note. Secondly, the dataset is provided, which is comprised of the columns and rows. In this case, the note contains the patient information, while the dataset is the column and row-wise values. Third, after acquiring the proper data, the data must be normalized, which involves assigning a value corresponding to the scale of each value and removing any anomalies in the data. For instance, if the scale of the values changes, we can change the units of measurements to unify them. Anomalies, such as missing data and non-numeric values, need to be addressed. Anomalies, such as missing data, can be removed. Non-numeric values can be either changed to numerical values, for example, by converting categorical data into numeric data. The clinical trial data needs to be standardized to ensure comparable results. This involves normalizing the values to a common scale and removing outliers. One approach to address anomalies is data cleaning and transformation. This process may involve fixing incorrect values, correcting data entry mistakes, and filling in missing data. Finally, once the data is cleaned, it is used to train a machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network model, a transformer model or a combination of both, in our case. Through these different steps, data can be processed and analyzed in a manner that can help identify trends and make predictions, which we explain later in the paper.</s>",

The `random` module is used for randomizing the order of patient evaluation. Then, the trial name is read as a variable, which can be changed any time the user wants to reevaluate. After that, patient data are read individually and organized into an array to run a for loop that accesses each patient from this array. For each patient, the script access each patient's information and checks if the `inclusion_criteria` match any of the given `patient_note` characteristics. If the patient has no `matching_data` or no `matching_data` with `exclusion_criteria`, the script will provide the `eligibility` for that patient to that given trial.

Moreover, no known autoimmune disease, no known HIV positive, no psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit study compliance, no systemic steroid therapy required, no known history of CNS disease, no active systemic infection requiring parental antibiotic therapy, and no systemic steroid therapy required are also compatible with the trial eligibility criterion. Lastly, there is no mention of pregnancy or fertile patients being excluded from the trial, allowing the potential for study participation. After the above analysis, we can conclude that the patient would be considered `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`, meaning that they would be allowed to participate in the trial.</s>",

        "output": "In order to determine whether the given patient note is eligible for the selected clinical trial, I can follow the following general guidelines: First, I should read the patient note to understand the eligibility criteria and study design. The patient note describes an adult that was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain and nausea that had started 4 days ago. The ultrasound revealed gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. In the third line after reading the patient note was the fact that gallstones have caused the patient's pain. Based on this information, I can determine that the patient is most likely eligible to participate in the clinical trial. The patient has also been diagnosed with various types of gallstone disease, which makes him or her a good candidate. I can then compare this against the eligibility criteria for the selected clinical trial. Based on the eligibility criteria, the patient is excluded if they have an underlying condition that would affect life expectancy or if they are currently taking therapy for another medical condition. I can determine that the patient is not currently taking any other therapy. Since the patient has a condition that affects life expectancy, I need more information to determine if they are eligible for the trial. I can find that the patient has two prior episodes of NVDs. I can also determine that the patient uses alcohol, but does not smoke or use illicit drugs. The patient's age is ideal for the clinical trial, and the trial protocol states that there is no plan to conduct prior treatment with statins in the clinical trial, which eliminates another exclusion criteria. Finally, I can conclude from all the information that I have gathered from the patient that the patient is most likely eligible for the selected clinical trial.

The note does not mention \"fasting\" or \"LDL-C\", but it mentions \"cholesterol\" and \"LDL\", so we need to calculate \"cholesterol / triglyceride\" (CTI) and check whether it is < 50. In the note, the level of cholesterol is mentioned \"(Value) 190 mg/dl\", but there is no unit information. The normal range for cholesterol is 129 to 190 mg/dl, so we assume it is (value) 190-129=61. There is no mention of the \"fasting\", so we need to calculate the CTI based on the mentioned value and check if it is < 50. The note mentions the HDL value of the patient (Value) 40 mg/dl, but it does not contain the total value of cholesterol.

The participant is 25 years old, which means they are older than 18 years, so they are not eligible according to the first exclusion criterion for most trials. On the other hand, if we can find a trial where there is no age restriction requirement, the next step is to evaluate the gender criterion. The participant is a male, and most clinical trials for this medication are for women. Still, some trials that are related to the male population only require participants to be male if they are aged 25 years to 65 years (Sinha et al., 2018). 70 years of age (Dudenbostel et al., 2017) and 75 years of age (Davoli and Dudenbostel, 2011). Therefore, the participant can fulfill the eligibility criteria. To ensure that the patient is not excluded, it is necessary to consider the characteristics that can vary from trial to trial. For instance, in the exclusion criteria, criterion 4 says, \"Fasting serum TG >400 mg/dL (>4.52 mmol/L) at the screening visit (Week-3)\". The participant does not fulfill this criterion since their TG level is 140 mg/dl, and only the TG value equal to or greater than 4.52 mmol/l should be excluded. It is important to consider that the TG value can vary, and the values presented are only examples; the TG value can be lower; for instance, if the TG value is 200 mg/dL, the patient will be excluded. The same happens with the Lab values; the participant cannot be considered eligible since the Hba1c is less than 6.5, and the normal value of Hba1c in the participant ranges from 4.6 to 5.8, less than 6.5, which will be excluded. The patient can be considered excluded since they use 70/30 insulin, and according to the exclusion criteria, they may take insulin except for \"insulin treatment\" trials.

For this task, I have used named entity recognition libraries and trained models to identify and name entities in the text, and then mapped the identified entities to the pre-defined structured format to extract the information needed for the assignment by identifying the named entities in a text using natural language processing (NLP) and a name entity recognition (NER) library. I have used Python programming language and a named entity recognition library called spaCy . I have downloaded a pre-trained model for biomedical named entity recognition. This model classifies all sentences into different named entity tags. In all instances where the model was able to classify an entity as an 'entity', I mapped it to the 'Yes' answer on the corresponding question, and the answer 'No' in the other cases. This model is able to recognize and name entities such as genes, protein and chemical compounds that are well-defined, but it does not recognize names of medical conditions. The pre-trained model is very specific for biomedical entities, recognizing biomedical entities in the text such as genes, diseases, drugs, proteins, protocols, cell lines, etc. Here are the steps I have taken, and you can see them in the following lines of code: Load the model trained for Named entity recognition using spaCy, which is downloaded from the spaCy model hub called 'biomed'). ```python![spacy]>>> nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")```</s>",
