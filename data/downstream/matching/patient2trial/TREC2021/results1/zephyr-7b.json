She has undergone a mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, and there is no mention of the number of lymph nodes removed, but there is mention of 5 positive lymph nodes. This satisfies the pathological criteria for surgery.\n\n3. Estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 status: The patient's estrogen and progesterone receptor statuses are not mentioned in the patient note, but the HER2 status is HER2-positive. Since the inclusion criteria require that all three receptors be tested before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, if the patient has received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she would not be eligible.

The surgical wound is also completely healed, which suggests that there are no signs of infection.\n\n5.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Limited Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Low Risk Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: Phase II trial of 2 years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy after low risk hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, node negative breast cancer in women older than 50 at diagnosis.~The study hypothesis is that reducing adjuvant endocrine therapy from 5 to 2 years in a population with low risk of breast cancer; as determined by histopathologic criteria and confirmed by low risk genomic analysis using Prosigna\u00ae; will be safe and acceptable to this population, and will not compromise the expected excellent breast cancer specific outcomes for this population.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria: for Prosigna\u00ae screening\nDiagnosis of invasive breast cancer which is:\nUnifocal or multifocal (not multicentric)\nUnilateral\nModerate or strongly hormone receptor positive\nHER2 negative\nDuctal grade 1 or 2, or lobular any grade, or pure tubular (any grade) or pure papillary (any grade).

Tumor size must be sufficient for Prosigna\u00ae testing. pNX (nodal status unknown) stage is not eligible.\nSubject must be female\nSubject must be age > 50 years at breast cancer diagnosis\nSubject may be pre, peri, or postmenopausal.\nSubject must have a > 5-year life expectancy based on physician judgement of subject's co-morbid illnesses and age\nSubject must undergo standard of care loco-regional management (sentinel node biopsy and/or axillary dissection; breast conserving surgery or mastectomy; radiation to breast following breast conserving surgery, with radiotherapy details per local institution practice). Surgery will have been no more than 24 weeks prior to endocrine therapy start. Subjects having repeat surgeries after radiation, regardless of indication, should count the date of last surgery that preceded radiation. Subjects may undergo Prosigna\u00ae screening prior to completion of radiation.\nThe breast surgery will have achieved negative surgical margins. Tumours with positive margins that are not re-resectable are eligible if followed by radiation with a boost (partial mastectomy) or chest wall radiation (mastectomy)\nNo (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) chemotherapy given or planned for this breast cancer\nNo other non-breast cancer within the last 5 years, except non-melanoma skin cancer, melanoma in situ, cervix carcinoma in situ, and anal carcinoma in situ\nNo prior hormone receptor positive invasive breast cancer. Prior contralateral DCIS treated with standard of care local therapy, and prior lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are allowed, provided no endocrine therapy with any of tamoxifen, ovarian suppression, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitor was given\nSubject will have not have started endocrine therapy prior to enrollment\nSubject has signed a screening informed consent form\nSubject has intent to be adherent to endocrine therapy for two years in the absence of serious toxicity\nInclusion criteria for study enrollment:\nProsigna\u00ae score in the low risk range, defined as an ROR of 40 or lower\nSubject has not yet initiated endocrine therapy\nSubject has signed study informed consent form\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

However, the inclusion criteria state that subjects with hypertension or age as a CVD risk factor are eligible, whereas subjects without hypertension must have a certain LDL-C level range and either have 3 or more other CVD risk factors or fewer than 3 other CVD risk factors and a higher LDL-C level range. Since the patient's blood pressure is not \u2265140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive treatment, he falls under the second category. His Fasting LDL-C level is 545 mg/dL, which is outside the lower bound of the LDL-C level range for subjects without hypertension who have fewer than 3 other CVD risk factors. Therefore, the patient does not completely meet the LDL-C level requirement.\n\n2. Not relevant criteria: The patient's age (46 years) satisfies both inclusion age range criteria. The fasting glucose and triglyceride levels of the patient are within the normal limits, as required by the inclusion criteria. \n\n3. Eligibility criteria: The inclusion criteria require subjects to have a maximum IMT \u22651.2 mm and <3.5 mm at any location in the carotid ultrasound scans conducted at both Visit 2 and Visit 3. Since the patient's neck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull, and ultrasonography revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA), as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA), the patient is likely a suitable candidate for this trial. We need to refer to the specified cutoff values for the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) of the LICA, which are 208.5 cm/s and 54.5 cm/s, respectively, as mentioned in the patient's note. \n\nAfter taking into account",

Since the patient's left internal carotid artery has a peak-systolic velocity (PSV) of 208.5 cm/s and an end-diastolic velocity (EDV) of 54.5 cm/s, which exceed the cutoff values for severe narrowing, it is likely that this artery meets the inclusion criteria. It is not explicitly stated whether the right internal carotid artery's moderate stenosis also fulfills the >70% requirement, but since multi-vessel coronary artery disease involves stenosis in two or more arteries, the patient's overall presentation suggests that he meets the multi-vessel coronary artery disease inclusion criterion. \n\nRegarding the second inclusion criterion, it is not entirely clear whether the patient is truly at relative equipoise for his treatment options.
