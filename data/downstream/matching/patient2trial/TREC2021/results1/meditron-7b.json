And to check the patient's eligibility in detail, we should print each of the criteria.\n\n### [INST] Criterion-level eligibility:\nBreast cancer patients of any age with Stage II breast cancer who met the criteria:\nThis study requires an excisional biopsy of the primary tumor. No prior therapy was given for clinical Stage II breast cancer (N0, N1, T1N1, T2N0, T2N1)\n\n\n## Summary:\nThis is a multi-center randomized trial comparing preoperative versus postoperative FLAC/G-CSF chemotherapy.\n\n# [INST] Criteria:\nAge and clinical staging of the patient's tumor allow the trial to be open to all ages and stages, except stage IV. A patient with a tumor more than T3N1 will be excluded because such a tumor may not be amenable to breast-conserving therapy. In this study, all stage II tumors will be considered acceptable.\n\n# [INST] Clinical staging:\nStage II patients are enrolled under the following criteria: T1 or T2; no lymphatic involvement in the breast (NO) + lymph nodes = N1, N2, or N3, T2N1, T2N2 or T2N3; and no distant metastases; all must be classified by the 1986 AJCC TM.\n\n# [INST] Histologic and molecular parameters:\nIn order to include adequately heterogeneous disease, HER2 positive/ER positive patients will be allowed; so too will TNBC. Patients will not be allowed to have a history of prior local or systemic therapy for Stage II breast cancer. Stage III, IV and ER negative patients will be excluded. The criteria for estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity are 10fmol/gram tissue and 5",
