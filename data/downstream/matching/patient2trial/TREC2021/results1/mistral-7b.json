In the North American Inter-Group factorial trial design (CALGB 9741) the concept of dosedense adjuvant chemotherapy was further tested in patients with node-positive breast cancer. Weekly paclitaxel after standard adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide improves disease-free and overall survival in women with breast cancer. Investigators asked if dose-dense 2-week intertreatment intervals (supported by the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) were better than the conventional inconvenient weekly intervals.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between 18-70 years female operable breast cancer patients\n* Patients were required to register within 60 days from the final surgical procedure required to adequately treat the invasive primary tumor.\n* women who had operable,histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with a. histologically involved positive lymph nodes b. or histologic diagnosis for three negative patients; c. or lymph node negative, HER2 positive(if HER2 + +, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization method)/CISH tests confirmed HER2 amplification is positive),but unable or intolerant to herceptin combined chem",

It is more prevalent in countries with high-income economies, where 60-80% of the population report back pain at some point in their life. Numerous medication options are available for acute LBP relief such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), myorelaxant drugs, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Magnesium is a physiological voltage-dependent blocker of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA)-coupled channels that can influence inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain through several different mechanisms. In this study the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of magnesium oral supplementation for acute low back pain.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* patients aged>18 years old,\n* initiation of acute low back pain in",

Secondary objectives are 1) To compare the efficacy of SOF+RBV with or without PEG as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response at 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12); 2) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOF+RBV with or without PEG; 3) To assess the impact of SVR12 on insulin resistance.`",

Coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery improves the long term survival in patients with diabetes and multi-vessel disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing CABG surgery when initiated at least 4 weeks pre-operatively. Observational data have suggested that pre-operative ACE administration is associated with an increased risk of post-operative vasoplegic shock, acute kidney injury, and mortality; however, other studies have failed to confirm these findings and further suggested ACE are associated with a reduced risk of peri-operative myocardial infarction. A single trial of 40 CABG patients randomized to pre-operative ACE withdrawal or continuation reported that the withdrawal group required significantly fewer vasopressors during cardiopulmonary bypass but more intravenous vasodilators post-operatively to control hypertension. Hence, it remains unclear whether ACEs should be held or continued immediately prior to CABG surgery and a survey of cardiac surgeons suggests that current clinical practice is divided. This pilot study aims to establish the feasibility of the study",

It will give support to the conclusion that it is critical to bolus every time they eat and to bolus on time to decrease cardiovascular consequences of poorly controlled diabetes. The hypothesis is that giving insulin before a meal compared to not giving insulin before a meal will be associated with lower arterial stiffness in children with Type I diabetes.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nType 1 diabetes based on clinical history\nBasal-bolus insulin regimen\nDuration of diabetes greater than 1 year\nBlood glucose 65-200 mg/dL fasting\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible. \n\nThe patient is eligible for this clinical trial as he meets all the inclusion criteria.</s>",

We cannot determine if the patient has decreased ability to carry out activities based on the information provided, but we can assume that the patient does not have decreased ability to carry out activities.\n\nFinally, we check if the patient is willing to participate in the exercise program. Since the patient does not have COPD, it is not clear if he is willing to participate in the exercise program.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the trial-level eligibility is 0) Excluded.</s>",

The patient also doesn't have any abnormal signs on CTMRI, only leukoaraiosis. However, based on the information provided in the patient note, the patient is not suspected of having hypertension-induced cognitive impairment. Also, the patient doesn't present with the overabundant liver-fire, yin deficiency, and yang hyperactivity TCM syndromes, so the patient doesn't meet this inclusion criteria.\n* Guardian/Patient's attitudes towards the research: This information is not provided in the patient note, so the patient cannot be assessed regarding this criterion.\n* Education: The patient is unable to read simple newspapers in the past, however, in this case, the clinician can use his discretion to decide whether the requirement of being able to read simple newspapers in the past is a must for this patient.\n* Informed consent: The patient",

        "output": "To determine the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial, we need to compare the patient's note with the inclusion criteria of the trial. Here's an outline of the assessment of eligibility for the patient:\n\n1. Age: The patient is a 25-year-old man, which is within the age range specified in the inclusion criteria (there is no specific age requirement in the inclusion criteria for this trial).\n2. Gender: The patient is a man, which matches the gender requirement in the inclusion criteria (the inclusion criteria do not specify a requirement for gender).\n3. Disease status: The patient has type 1 diabetes, which is not a cardiometabolic condition (the trial aims to investigate the effects of different corn flours on cardiovascular health). However, since the patient has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, they may be eligible to participate in the trial; we need to check their cholesterol levels.\n4. Elevated cholesterol levels: The patient's total cholesterol level is 190 mg/dl, which is above the threshold of 120 mg/dl required for inclusion in the trial. However, the inclusion criteria indicate that individuals with cholesterol levels greater than 190 mg/dl will be permitted to participate but must provide a letter from their doctor stating that they are comfortable with their participation in the study. We don't have any information in the patient's note, but assuming the patient has no other issues with their health, we can assume their doctor will be comfortable with their participation in the study.\n5. Other include criteria: While there are no specific other inclusion criteria mentioned in the note, there are no exclusion criteria mentioned in the note that would disqualify the patient from the trial (such as history of heart disease, history of cancer, etc.).\n\nBased on the above assessment, we can conclude that the patient is eligible for the clinical trial. \n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",
