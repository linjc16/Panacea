Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

For this reason, the initial eligibility assessment based on the patient note should be limited to the information provided.\n\nWith that in mind, let's go through the inclusion criteria for the trial and assess the patient's eligibility based on the information provided:\n\n* The patient has signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines. This criterion does not apply to this patient, as the presence of a signed consent form is not mentioned in the patient note.\n* The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

Assuming that the patient is able to comply with the radiation therapy schedule and other requirements, we can estimate that her ECOG performance status is likely to be 0 or 1. For this reason, we can answer this criterion positively (1).\n* The patient must have clinically T1-3, N1 breast cancer at the time of diagnosis (before neoadjuvant therapy); clinical axillary nodal involvement can be assessed by palpation, ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or PET/CT scan.

Radiation therapy uses a type of energy to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Brachytherapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that provides radiation inside the breast to any remaining tumor cells next to the space where the tumor was removed, and is given over a shorter amount of time than standard radiation therapy. Giving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy may reduce the overall time that radiation is delivered to the tumor cells.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nMust sign informed consent\nSurgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy; the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (negative surgical margins per National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project [NSABP] criteria)\nOn histologic examination, the tumor must be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and/or invasive breast carcin",
