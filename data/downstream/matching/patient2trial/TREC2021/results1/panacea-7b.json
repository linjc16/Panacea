Cervical cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm of women in Taiwan. There were 2,720 new cases of invasive carcinoma of the cervix and 971 deaths from the disease in 2000. Cervical cancer is indeed is an important disease in Taiwan.~The primary therapies for cervical cancer are surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Several clinical trials have showed that an improvement in time to progression and survival for patients given chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone. Chemoradiotherapy is now regarded as standard modality to treat the locally advanced (stage IIB-IVA) or high-risk early-stage cervical cancer. However, some of the cervical cancer patients still failed to response to the treatment of cervical cancer or relapsed for completion of treatment.~Angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Recent studies have related angiogenesis to cancer growth and metastasis Ultrasonography has been used in the gynecologic field for decades. The previous studies of our team have shown that incremental angiogenesis could be demonstrated in the tumorigenesis of ovarian, endometrial malignancies, and cervical caner. Besides, other growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IL-6 have also been reported to correlate with the angiogenesis and the prognosis of cervical cancer. It seems that tumor angiogenesis could be utilized as a good marker to survey the severity of disease and prognosis of early-staged cervical cancer patients.~There is no good method or marker which could be utilized to monitor the response of radiotherapy and evaluate the prognosis of cervical cancer patients with advanced stages. So we would like to propose this proposal to focus on the tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer patients with advanced stages. There are several purposes in this study. First, we will evaluate the kinetic changes of tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Second, we will evaluate that if the tumor angiogenesis could be a marker to monitor the response of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer patients. The relation between tumor angiogenesis and radiotherapy will be explored and clarified by this study. The comprehensive role of tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer will be elucidated by the results of this study.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n- cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Despite superior cosmetic outcome, BCT is more complex and requires a protracted treatment regimen comprised of 6 weeks of daily external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. The purpose of this study is to determine if an acceptable outcome can be achieved with radiation delivered only to the region of the tumor bed. If this is true, partial breast irradiation may lend itself to much shorter treatment times (one week) and the toxicities to adjacent normal structures (heart, lung, chest wall) will be greatly reduced.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nInvasive breast cancer or DCIS, tumor stage of Tis, T1, T2 if lesion is < 3 cm, N0 or N1 if 1-3 + nodes with no extracapsular extension\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Our group has previously shown that optical techniques can effectively discriminate between malignant and non-malignant breast tissues. We have also shown that data collection and processing from a single point on the tissue specimen requires less than 5 seconds. In addition, the technique is easily adaptable to provide sensing depths that are required for breast margin assessment. The goal of the work proposed in this protocol is to test the sensitivity and specificity of an optical assay system developed by our group, for intra operative assessment of breast tumor margins.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nClinical diagnosis of Breast Cancer\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: HER2 Imaging Study to Identify HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient Unlikely to Benefit From T-DM1\n\n\nSummary: T-DM1 , which is a highly innovative but also expensive antiHER2 agent consisting in the coupling of the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with a cytotoxic agent (maytansine derivate) has shown an encouraging antitumor activity evaluated by Recist criteria (35% objective response rate, 44% stable disease, 18% progressive disease) in patients with advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated with several cytotoxic drugs, trastuzumab and lapatinib.~Rationale I :For TDM1 to be active, the presence of an intact HER2 receptor is key since the internalization of the cytotoxic moiety depends on the binding of trastuzumab to the external domain of HER2.~The zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab PET/CT (or HER2 immunoPET/CT) is a non invasive test which shows promise in measuring HER2 expression (extracellular domain) for the entire disease burden and which could identify non responding patients prior to TDM1 administration.~Rationale II: As for many such agents, it is desirable to identify early on (here with the use of FDG-PET/CT) which patients are unlikely to benefit from the therapy\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nThe patient must have histologically confirmed HER2 positive invasive carcinoma of the breast in the reference laboratory of the participating center. HER2 positive criteria to be applied are those used in the participating countries:\nBelgium: FISH amplification ratio \u2265 2 in the reference laboratory of the participating center\nThe Netherlands: IHC 3+ or FISH ratio \u2265 2 in the reference laboratory of the participating center\nThe patient must have documented progressive disease and present with at least 2 non-bone target metastatic lesions, unequivocally of neoplastic origin with\na transaxial diameter greater than 2 cm on the screening diagnostic CT/MRI for all non-bone lesions except lymphnodes\na short axis greater than 1,5 cm for lymphnodes on the screening diagnostic CT/MRI These two lesions should not be confluent with adjacent lesions and not have been irradiated previously.\nA concurrent biopsy of a metastatic site is mandatory (with two formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core sample and two snap frozen tumor sample) after progression has been documented and before inclusion and the patient agrees with the procedure.\nPrimary tumor blocks (or 11 unstained slides) available for confirmatory central laboratory HER2 testing in Institut Jules Bordet. If available, a snap frozen sample of the primary tumor will also be centralized in Institut Jules Bordet.\nAge \u2265 18 years\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1\nNo significant cardiac history and current LVEF \u2265 50%\nAdequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:\nAbsolute neutrophil count > 1,500 cells/mm3\nPlatelet count > 100,000 cells/mm3\nHemoglobin > 9 g/dL\nAST(SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 2.5 x ULN\nTotal Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert's syndrome. Patients with known Gilbert's Syndrome should have direct bilirubin within normal limits.\nSerum alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN. Patients with bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase \u2264 5 x ULN\nSerum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL or 177 \u03bcmol/L\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time or partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or PTT) < 1.5 x ULN (unless on therapeutic anti-coagulation except vitamin K antagonists which are prohibited in this study)\nAbsence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.\nFor women of childbearing potential a serum pregnancy test will be done (and it must be negative) and an agreement to use a highly-effective form of contraception during all the study and at least the following 7 months will be obtained.\nSigned written informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedure.\nCompletion of all necessary baseline surgical, laboratory and imaging investigations prior to patient inclusion.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Carbon Dye Tattooing of Biopsied Axillary Node in Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: The primary aim of this prospective, multicentre study is to determine whether the involved node can be marked using black carbon dye and successfully identified at the time of surgery. The secondary aims are to determine the concordance between the tattooed node and sentinel node, migration of black dye into other nodes, and false-negative rate of tattooed node (in patients undergoing ALND after NACT).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge \u2265 18\nMale or female\nPatients scheduled to undergo routine fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of abnormal axillary lymph node\nInvasive breast cancer\nWritten informed consent for the study\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.
