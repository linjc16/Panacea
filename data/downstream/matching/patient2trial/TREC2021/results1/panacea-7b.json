Cervical cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm of women in Taiwan. There were 2,720 new cases of invasive carcinoma of the cervix and 971 deaths from the disease in 2000. Cervical cancer is indeed is an important disease in Taiwan.~The primary therapies for cervical cancer are surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Several clinical trials have showed that an improvement in time to progression and survival for patients given chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone. Chemoradiotherapy is now regarded as standard modality to treat the locally advanced (stage IIB-IVA) or high-risk early-stage cervical cancer. However, some of the cervical cancer patients still failed to response to the treatment of cervical cancer or relapsed for completion of treatment.~Angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Recent studies have related angiogenesis to cancer growth and metastasis Ultrasonography has been used in the gynecologic field for decades. The previous studies of our team have shown that incremental angiogenesis could be demonstrated in the tumorigenesis of ovarian, endometrial malignancies, and cervical caner. Besides, other growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IL-6 have also been reported to correlate with the angiogenesis and the prognosis of cervical cancer. It seems that tumor angiogenesis could be utilized as a good marker to survey the severity of disease and prognosis of early-staged cervical cancer patients.~There is no good method or marker which could be utilized to monitor the response of radiotherapy and evaluate the prognosis of cervical cancer patients with advanced stages. So we would like to propose this proposal to focus on the tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer patients with advanced stages. There are several purposes in this study. First, we will evaluate the kinetic changes of tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Second, we will evaluate that if the tumor angiogenesis could be a marker to monitor the response of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer patients. The relation between tumor angiogenesis and radiotherapy will be explored and clarified by this study. The comprehensive role of tumor angiogenesis in cervical cancer will be elucidated by the results of this study.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\n- cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Despite superior cosmetic outcome, BCT is more complex and requires a protracted treatment regimen comprised of 6 weeks of daily external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. The purpose of this study is to determine if an acceptable outcome can be achieved with radiation delivered only to the region of the tumor bed. If this is true, partial breast irradiation may lend itself to much shorter treatment times (one week) and the toxicities to adjacent normal structures (heart, lung, chest wall) will be greatly reduced.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nInvasive breast cancer or DCIS, tumor stage of Tis, T1, T2 if lesion is < 3 cm, N0 or N1 if 1-3 + nodes with no extracapsular extension\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Our group has previously shown that optical techniques can effectively discriminate between malignant and non-malignant breast tissues. We have also shown that data collection and processing from a single point on the tissue specimen requires less than 5 seconds. In addition, the technique is easily adaptable to provide sensing depths that are required for breast margin assessment. The goal of the work proposed in this protocol is to test the sensitivity and specificity of an optical assay system developed by our group, for intra operative assessment of breast tumor margins.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nClinical diagnosis of Breast Cancer\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: HER2 Imaging Study to Identify HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient Unlikely to Benefit From T-DM1\n\n\nSummary: T-DM1 , which is a highly innovative but also expensive antiHER2 agent consisting in the coupling of the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with a cytotoxic agent (maytansine derivate) has shown an encouraging antitumor activity evaluated by Recist criteria (35% objective response rate, 44% stable disease, 18% progressive disease) in patients with advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated with several cytotoxic drugs, trastuzumab and lapatinib.~Rationale I :For TDM1 to be active, the presence of an intact HER2 receptor is key since the internalization of the cytotoxic moiety depends on the binding of trastuzumab to the external domain of HER2.~The zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab PET/CT (or HER2 immunoPET/CT) is a non invasive test which shows promise in measuring HER2 expression (extracellular domain) for the entire disease burden and which could identify non responding patients prior to TDM1 administration.~Rationale II: As for many such agents, it is desirable to identify early on (here with the use of FDG-PET/CT) which patients are unlikely to benefit from the therapy\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nThe patient must have histologically confirmed HER2 positive invasive carcinoma of the breast in the reference laboratory of the participating center. HER2 positive criteria to be applied are those used in the participating countries:\nBelgium: FISH amplification ratio \u2265 2 in the reference laboratory of the participating center\nThe Netherlands: IHC 3+ or FISH ratio \u2265 2 in the reference laboratory of the participating center\nThe patient must have documented progressive disease and present with at least 2 non-bone target metastatic lesions, unequivocally of neoplastic origin with\na transaxial diameter greater than 2 cm on the screening diagnostic CT/MRI for all non-bone lesions except lymphnodes\na short axis greater than 1,5 cm for lymphnodes on the screening diagnostic CT/MRI These two lesions should not be confluent with adjacent lesions and not have been irradiated previously.\nA concurrent biopsy of a metastatic site is mandatory (with two formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core sample and two snap frozen tumor sample) after progression has been documented and before inclusion and the patient agrees with the procedure.\nPrimary tumor blocks (or 11 unstained slides) available for confirmatory central laboratory HER2 testing in Institut Jules Bordet. If available, a snap frozen sample of the primary tumor will also be centralized in Institut Jules Bordet.\nAge \u2265 18 years\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1\nNo significant cardiac history and current LVEF \u2265 50%\nAdequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:\nAbsolute neutrophil count > 1,500 cells/mm3\nPlatelet count > 100,000 cells/mm3\nHemoglobin > 9 g/dL\nAST(SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 2.5 x ULN\nTotal Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert's syndrome. Patients with known Gilbert's Syndrome should have direct bilirubin within normal limits.\nSerum alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN. Patients with bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase \u2264 5 x ULN\nSerum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL or 177 \u03bcmol/L\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time or partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or PTT) < 1.5 x ULN (unless on therapeutic anti-coagulation except vitamin K antagonists which are prohibited in this study)\nAbsence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.\nFor women of childbearing potential a serum pregnancy test will be done (and it must be negative) and an agreement to use a highly-effective form of contraception during all the study and at least the following 7 months will be obtained.\nSigned written informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedure.\nCompletion of all necessary baseline surgical, laboratory and imaging investigations prior to patient inclusion.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Carbon Dye Tattooing of Biopsied Axillary Node in Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: The primary aim of this prospective, multicentre study is to determine whether the involved node can be marked using black carbon dye and successfully identified at the time of surgery. The secondary aims are to determine the concordance between the tattooed node and sentinel node, migration of black dye into other nodes, and false-negative rate of tattooed node (in patients undergoing ALND after NACT).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge \u2265 18\nMale or female\nPatients scheduled to undergo routine fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of abnormal axillary lymph node\nInvasive breast cancer\nWritten informed consent for the study\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Paraoxonase and LDL Oxidation in Carotid Artery Disease\n\n\nSummary: Atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries is a common cause of stroke. The prevalence and progression of carotid atherosclerosis are believed to be influenced by genetically inherited variations in lipoprotein metabolism. This study investigates the specific role of paraoxonase, an enzyme thought to detoxify atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein. This study compares veterans who have significant carotid atherosclerosis on ultrasound examination with controls without carotid atherosclerosis. Both paraoxonase activity and genotype will be determined and compared between groups. The results may eventually make it possible to screen for a paraoxonase allele that confers high risk of atherosclerosis, and to diminish the risk by early treatment.\nInclusion criteria: Case: Either had a history of surgical carotid endarterectomy or carotid or CT angiogram showing greater than or equal to 80% stenosis in one or more internal carotid artery. Control: An ultrasound documenting internal carotid artery stenosis less than 15% bilaterally.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Stenting Versus Best Medical Treatment of Asymptomatic High Grade Carotid Artery Stenosis\n\n\nSummary: Background. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure\u00b4s safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST and ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However, particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications, which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be applicable any more.~Study hypothesis and aims. Given the low frequency of spontaneous neurological complications, the preferable therapeutic approach to patients with asymptomatic high grade ( > 80%) carotid artery stenoses is currently unknown. Modern best medical treatment may manage to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque, while CAS has the potential of resolving the carotid stenosis. Comparative data, however, are not available as yet. We hypothesized that protected CAS has a beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological complications and major adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic > 80% internal carotid artery stenosis. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to analyze neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with elective CAS plus best medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAtherosclerosis is the underlying disease\nPatients with an asymptomatic stenosis >80% (NASCET) with a documented progression of the degree of stenosis to >80% within 6 months with a very tight stenosis \u226590% at initial presentation with a >80% stenosis plus silent ipsilateral ischemia documented by CCT or MRI with ipsilateral >80% stenosis plus contralateral >80% stenosis or occlusion with >80% stenosis plus planned major surgery\nNeurologist\u00b4s explicit consent to potentially perform CAS\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Alcohol and Atherosclerosis Pilot Study\n\n\nSummary: We propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a long-term clinical trial of alcohol intake on atherosclerosis, the first step in determining whether moderate drinking prevents cardiovascular disease and hence in understanding the full health effects of alcohol across the population. We will randomize 40 participants aged 55 and older to a six-month period of consumption of 1 glass per day of either pure alcohol (diluted to the strength of wine) or water. At baseline and after 6 months, we will measure several standard and novel cardiovascular risk markers in the blood and will perform magnetic resonance imaging to measure atherosclerosis of the aorta.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nDiabetes\nCurrent Smoking\nHypertension\nFamily history of heart disease\nHigh LDL Cholesterol (>130 mg/dl)\nLow HDL CHolesterol (<40 mg/dl)\nBody Mass Index of 30 kg/m^2\nWaist circumference greater than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women\nReport intake of at least one drink in the last month\nPost-menopause (if woman)\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively.

Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria.

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: The Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Cohort Study\n\n\nSummary: SAFEHEART is a large, on-going registry study in molecularly defined patients with heterozygous FH treated in Spain.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nIndex cases with genetic diagnosis of FH and their relatives over 15 years old with a genetic diagnosis of FH and their first-degree relatives\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",
