        "output": "Patient note:\n\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\n\nClinical trial:\nTitle: Effect of Preoperative Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Stage II Breast Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Women of any age with clinical stage II breast cancer who met the following criteria:\n\t+ Patients with stage II breast cancer will include primary tumor less than or equal to 5 cm in size with axillary lymph nodes which are clinically ([N0 or N1] [T1N1, T2N0, T2N1]).\n\t+ Patients will be staged according to the 1986 AJCC TMM classification.\n\t+ Patients with bilateral breast cancer will be eligible provided at least one tumor is invasive and classified as stage I or II, and neither breast is stage III.\n\t+ Histologic sections of the breast tumor must be classified as an invasive primary breast neoplasm of epithelial origin.\n\t+ Patients must be geographically accessible for follow-up and willing to return for the follow-up at the NCI.\n\t+ Patients must be mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the protocol.\n\t+ Estrogen receptor (ER) status can include ER positive, negative, or unknown.\n\t+ Patients with prior cancers may be eligible as long as they have received curative therapy and have had no evidence of recurrence for greater than or equal to 10 years.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients will be excluded from this protocol for the following reasons:\n\t+ Advanced local disease or distant metastases (stage III or IV).\n\t+ Previous therapy to the breast other than excisional biopsy.\n\t+ Pregnancy.\n\t+ Unwillingness to use birth control during chemotherapy.\n\t+ Chronic disease such as heart, lung, liver, kidney, blood or metabolic disorders which may render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy. Specifically, liver function - SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin should be less than 1.5 x the upper limits of normal. Renal function - creatinine should be less than 1.7 and/or creatinine clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min. If there is any history of cardiac disease, patients must have a normal ejection fraction on MUGA scan and no angina.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\nThe patient meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial as she has stage II breast cancer with a primary tumor less than 5 cm in size and axillary lymph nodes that are clinically positive. She also meets the other criteria for inclusion such as being geographically accessible for follow-up and willing to return for follow-up at the NCI, being mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the protocol, and having an invasive primary breast neoplasm of epithelial origin.\n\nThe patient does not meet any of the exclusion criteria such as advanced local disease or distant metastases, previous therapy to the breast other than excisional biopsy, pregnancy, unwillingness to use birth control during chemotherapy, or chronic disease that may render her a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy.\n\nTherefore, the trial-level eligibility for this patient is 2) Eligible.</s>",
