Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) for Selected Patients With Early Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: This study investigates the feasibility and safety of delivering radiation therapy only to part of the breast, (the tumor bed and selected areas) rather than the whole breast, for patients with early stage breast cancer.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria\nHistologic Documentation:\nPatients will have histologically confirmed Unicentric Stage I (T1 N0 M0) invasive ductal breast cancer.\nHistologically negative tumor margin 2 mm or more from any inked edges, or no tumor in a re-excision specimen or final shaved specimen are permitted.\nTubular, mucinous and medullary variant histologies of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are permitted.\nLow-grade DCIS (I and II) of 2 cm or less with histologically negative margins of at least 2 mm margins (or a negative re-excision) are permitted.\nWomen age 70 years or older with T1 invasive ductal carcinoma which are estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) with clinically negative axillary nodes who do not undergo surgical lymph node evaluation are also eligible if patient will take hormonal therapy.\nPatients with T1N0 (i+) tumors on sentinel lymph node mapping or dissection (i.e. is tumor deposit is 0.2mm or less, regardless of whether the deposit is detected by IHC or H&E staining) will also be eligible, provided that completion axillary dissection has been performed to confirm N0 status.\nIn the case where invasive cancer is present, the invasive cancer's pathology will be used regardless if DCIS is also present.\nPrior Treatment: Patient may have been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients may be on adjuvant hormonal therapy or begin hormonal therapy following XRT at the discretion of the medical oncologist.\nAge >= 18 years of age\nECOG Performance Status 0-2.\nSigned Informed Consent\nExclusion Criteria\nThe following guidelines are to assist physicians in selecting patients for whom protocol therapy is safe and appropriate. Physicians should recognize that the following may seriously increase the risk to the patient entering this protocol. Patients who meet the following criteria should not be entered in this study:\n1a Multicentric IDC of the breast defined as discontiguous tumors separated by at least 5 cm of uninvolved tissue; alternatively, discontiguous tumors that are clinically or mammographically within separate breast quadrants or subareolar central region.\nb Multifocal IDC of the breast, defined as discontiguous discrete foci of invasive carcinoma, separated by uninvolved intervening tissue, but within an overall span of 5cm, or within the same breast quadrant or subareolar central region.\nTumor > 2.0 cm, nodal involvement on H&E staining, or metastatic involvement\nHistological evidence of:\nLymphovascular invasion: as defined by a tumor embolus present in an endothelial-lined space; cases with tumor emboli present clearly beyond the edges of the invasive tumor, or as a predominantly intraductal tumor with one or more areas of focal invasion 7, 55.\nInfiltrating papillary carcinoma\nMargins: In-situ or invasive carcinoma present less than 2 mm from the inked resection margin, or no tumor in",

Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV).

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: P-glycoprotein Inhibition as Adjunct Treatment for Medically Refractory Epilepsy.\n\n\nSummary: In up to 1 out of 3 patients with epilepsy, seizures continue to occur despite the use of one or more antiepileptic medications. Patients also have significant problems with side-effects of these medications as doses are increased.~Our body naturally generates miniature pumps located on the surfaces of many organs to get rid of toxic substances, and antiepileptic medications can be considered by the cells of the body to be a toxin. Research with epileptic brain regions have shown an increase in the amount of drug pumps, therefore getting rid of antiepileptic drugs. One of these pumps is called p-glycoprotein (P-gp for short). Medications may be unable to penetrate and stay within the parts of the brain that need them them most. This may mean that the amount of drug is actually lower in the parts of the brain that cause seizures, and higher in the rest of the brain, which may be why patients may still feel side-effects when seizures are still occurring.~Research in animals has shown that blocking the P-gp pumps can improve how bad, and how many seizures occur as well as the length of seizures. Blockage of the pumps can be done using a different type of medication. Some medications that are used for common problems have been discovered to also block P-gp pumps. One of these, carvedilol, is used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. It has been found to be very safe in these patients, and does not have a lot of side-effects. We plan to add this medication in addition to patient's anti-seizure medications to see if it will improve epileptic seizures.~The reason why some patients have high amounts of P-gp pumps and others do not may be related to their genetics. A simple blood test can be used to determine a person's potential to produce high quantities of the pumps. This study will also attempt to show that the genetics will affect how well the P-gp blocking will work.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nprobable or definite localization-related, primary generalized or symptomatic generalized epilepsy that is medically-refractory, as defined by treatment failure of at least 2 anti-epilepsy drugs at standard doses, despite medication compliance as determined by the treating neurologist\nat least 3 seizures/month in the 3-month period prior to randomization. Seizures that will be considered include generalized tonic clonic, complex partial, myoclonic and absence seizures. Simple partial seizures must have an observable motor component or have been otherwise been documented by videoEEG to be a definite seizure.\nPatients with prior epilepsy brain surgery or vagal nerve stimulator implantation will be allowed if medication and seizure frequency has been stable for the prior 3 months.\nAges between 10 and 75 years will be eligible for inclusion. Elderly patients without a history or symptoms of cardiovascular disease may be eligible on a case-by-case basis. No patients older than 75 will be included due to the possible cardiovascular side-effects.\nPre-menopausal women must be utilizing two reliable forms of birth control or abstinence\nability of the patient to understand the concept of a clinical trial by answering the following questions appropriately: o will your seizures get better, worse or stay the same?

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Patients who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that has progressed since their previous cancer treatment and that cannot be removed completely by surgery are eligible to be treated within this trial.\nTreatment with a new drug called Progesterone Receptor Antagonist ZK 230211 (ZK PRA) targets the progesterone receptor which may be expressed on breast cancer tumour cells. Therefore only patients with this progesterone receptor on their tumour cells can be included in this study.\nProgesterone receptor antagonists (including onapristone) have already shown efficacy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (Klijn et al. 2000). This phase II study investigates the efficacy (proof of concept), safety and tolerability of ZK PRA at two dose levels (25 mg and 100 mg) before initiating pivotal phase III trials.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPostmenopausal women defined as: aged >/= 50 years with amenorrhea for at least 12 months or aged < 50 years with 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within postmenopausal range (> 40 mIU/ml) or having undergone bilateral oophorectomy\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer\nMetastatic breast cancer (Stage IV according to UICC - Union Internationale Contre Cancer - criteria, Version 6)\nProgesterone receptor-positive tumors\nPatients must be considered candidates for endocrine therapy (no other therapies for breast cancer are required)\nDisease progression after first-line endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer (i.e. with tumor remission or stabilization lasting at least 3 months under endocrine therapy)\nAt least one measurable or non-measurable tumor lesion (according to RECIST criteria)\nWHO Performance status 1\nAdequate function of major organs and systems:\nHematopoietic:\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nAbsolute neutrophil count: 1,500/mm3\nPlatelet count: 100,000/mm3\nHepatic:\nTotal bilirubin: 1.5 times the upper limit of normal\nAST/ALT: 2.5 times the upper limit of normal\nRenal: Creatinine: 1.5 times the upper limit of normal\nGynecological: Endometrial thickness (in non-hysterectomized women) </= 10 mm double layer\nNo other uncontrolled concurrent illness\nAdequate recovery from previous surgery, radiation and chemotherapy\nWritten informed consent\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `T",

She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Evaluation of Accelerated Partial Breast Brachytherapy\n\n\nSummary: Over the past two decades, breast conserving therapy (BCT) has become a major treatment modality for Stage I and II breast carcinoma. The major advantages of breast conserving therapy are superior cosmetic outcome and the reduced emotional and psychological trauma afforded by this procedure compared with conventional mastectomy. The principal disadvantage of BCT is its more complex and prolonged treatment regimen requiring approximately 6 weeks of external beam radiation therapy that poses problems for some patients such as the working woman, elderly patients, and those who live at a significant distance from a treatment center. These factors, along with the patient's geographic location, result in a smaller fraction of the patients who currently meet eligibility criteria for BCT actually receiving it, despite its cosmetic and probable psychological advantages. The logistical problems of BCT are primarily related to the protracted course of external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. While some investigators reported what they believe to be acceptable local control rates in carefully selected patients treated by wide local excision without radiation therapy, the criteria for patient selection are controversial and poorly defined and probably restrict the access of many patients to breast conserving therapy.~If previous observations are valid and breast irradiation following tylectomy exerts its maximal effect in eradicating occult disease remaining in the immediate vicinity of the tylectomy site, can radiation therapy be directed only to the tissue surrounding the excision cavity of the breast, using brachytherapy alone? If so, the entire course of radiation therapy could be delivered over a 4 to 7 day period immediately following tylectomy and/or axillary dissection, thus markedly reducing treatment time. Brachytherapy also inherently provides a higher central dose to the volume most at risk for recurrence. Cosmetic outcome after the use of a brachytherapy boost after external whole breast radiotherapy is comparable or slightly inferior to electron beam boost radiation therapy\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAJCC stage 0, I, or II (TisN0, T1N0, T2N0 = 3 cm) histologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast, treated with tylectomy. Axillary sampling is required only for cases of invasive cancers. Tumor size is determined by the pathologist. Clinical size may be used if the pathologic size is indeterminate.\nSigned study-specific informed consent for participation in the study.\nNegative, or close but negative, inked histologic margins of tylectomy or reexcision specimen to be confirmed prior to placing the brachytherapy catheters. Margins generally are positive if there is invasive or noninvasive tumor at the inked resection margin, close but negative if the tumor is within 2 mm of the inked margin and negative if the tumor is at least 2 mm away from the inked edge.\nNegative post-tylectomy or post-reexcision mammography if cancer presented with malignancy-associated microcalcifications; no remaining suspicious microcalcifications in the breast before brachytherapy.\nFor patients with invasive cancer, no positive axillary lymph nodes with at least 6 axillary lymph nodes sampled or a negative sentinel node.\nInvasive ductal, lobular, medullary, papillary, colloid (mucinous),or tubular histologies. Noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ.\nChemotherapy or hormonal therapy planned for = 2 weeks after removal of brachytherapy catheters is permitted.

Giving letrozole together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving letrozole together with erlotinib works in treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\nPatients must have estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with measurable (but not operable) locally recurrent disease, or measurable and/or evaluable metastatic disease (see protocol section 10.3), including isolated bone metastases.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not have had more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and have fully recovered from any grade 2-4 toxicities related to chemotherapy. No concurrent chemotherapy is allowed while on protocol therapy.\n\n\nPATIENTS MAY HAVE:\nPatients may have had 1 prior hormonal therapy for metastatic disease. This includes: tamoxifen, fulvestrant, anastrozole, exemestane, aminoglutethimide, megace, and letrozole. Patients may have received tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not have had prior therapy with EGF receptor inhibitors.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not have a history of central nervous system metastases or unevaluated CNS symptoms suggestive of possible brain metastases.\n\n\nPATIENTS MAY HAVE:\nPatients may receive concurrent radiation therapy to painful bone metastases or areas of impending bone fracture as long as radiation therapy is initiated prior to study entry and sites of evaluable disease outside the radiation port(s) are available for follow-up. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy must have recovered from toxicity induced by this treatment.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients < 55 years of age must not have received Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists within 3 months prior to protocol therapy.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not suffer from medical or psychiatric conditions that would interfere with ability to provide informed consent, communicate side effects, or comply with protocol requirements including maintenance of a compliance/pill diary.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not have a history of central nervous system metastases or unevaluated CNS symptoms suggestive of possible brain metastases.\n\n\nPATIENTS MUST NOT HAVE:\nPatients must not have a history of central nervous system metastases or unevaluated CNS sympt",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Bevacizumab, Metronomic Chemotherapy (CM), Diet and Exercise After Preoperative Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: If residual breast cancer is found in the breast or lymph node tissue removed after preoperative chemotherapy, one may be at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in the future. The purpose of this research study is to determine if having additional treatment after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery with bevacizumab and metronomic chemotherapy would make a difference in reducing the participants chance of breast cancer recurrence compared to the standard of care, which is observation alone. This study will also evaluate the potential additional benefits from participating in an exercise and dietary intervention compared to the dietary intervention alone. Because no one knows which which post-neoadjuvant strategy is best, participants will be randomized to one of the study groups: 1. Diet Intervention arm, 2. Diet and Exercise Intervention Arm, 3. Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and diet intervention, 4. Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, diet and exercise intervention arm.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. HER2 positive disease is not allowed. Metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) is not allowed.\nFor patients entering the trial after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there must be the presence of residual invasive disease on pathologic review following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Residual disease is defined as a Miller-Payne response in the breast of 0-4 and/or residual carcinoma in one or more regional lymph nodes that would meet AJCC 7th edition criteria for N1 - N3 disease. The presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease. Alternatively, if Miller-Payne grading is not available, the patient will be eligible if the pathology report indicates any residual invasive carcinoma following neoadjuvant therapy.\nIf tumor is triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) and the patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, disease may be clinical stage I-III pre-operatively, per AJCC 7th edition, based on baseline evaluation by clinical examination and/or breast imaging. Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who do not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are not eligible for this protocol.\nFor patients who completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the regimen must contain an anthracycline, a taxane, or both. Patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy as part of a clinical trial are acceptable.\nPatients must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however positive margins are acceptable if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has received radiotherapy. Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ are eligible.\nPost-mastectomy radiotherapy is suggested for all patients with a primary tumor 5cm or greater or involvement of 4 or more lymph nodes. Whole breast radiotherapy is required for patients who underwent breast conserving therapy, including lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, and excisional biopsy.\nPatients must have the presence of residual invasive disease on pathologic review following their preoperative chemotherapy. The presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease. Alternatively",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls.

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically confirmed, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II or III breast cancer\nHigh risk of breast cancer recurrence, defined as documented evidence of one or more of the following criteria:\ni) Biopsy evidence of breast cancer in regional lymph node(s) (node-positive disease); Nodal micrometastases only are not considered node positive ii) Tumor size > 5 cm (T3) or locally advanced disease (T4)\nDocumented pathological evaluation of the breast cancer for hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) status and HER-2 status\nSubjects must be receiving or be scheduled to receive standard of care systemic adjuvant or neoadj",

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Paclitaxel, Trastuzumab, and Pertuzumab in the Treatment of Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of drugs can help to treat this type of cancer. One drug is a chemotherapy agent called paclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae). Paclitaxel will be given every week through the vein. Although the weekly schedule of paclitaxel is not included in the label, the schedule and dose of weekly paclitaxel have been studied and have been proven to be more effective than an old standard schedule. The other two work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) and it is commonly given to women with early HER2 positive breast cancer or with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Trastuzumab will be given through the vein every 3 weeks (or every week at the doctor's discretion). The third drug, pertuzumab, is an investigational drug. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been given in studies to over 800 people. It has been effective in treating HER2 positive breast cancer. Pertuzumab will be given every 3 weeks through the vein. This study is looking at the effectiveness of these three drugs together.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge \u226518\nStage IV HER2 (+) breast cancer.\nHistologically documented HER2 (+) breast cancer as defined as IHC 3+ or FISH amplification of \u2265 2.0 of primary or metastatic site; results from the local lab are acceptable.

Prior anthracycline, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting are allowed. If the patient has one trastuzumab-based treatment in the metastatic setting and is given a break (even intermittently) from the partner drug given with trastuzumab and is continued on trastuzumab alone (or followed by trastuzumab alone again) may be considered as one treatment. For example, if the patient was given paclitaxel + trastuzumab and was later continued on trastuzumab alone or then restarted on paclitaxel + trastuzumab again, the regimen paclitaxel + trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab alone (or followed by paclitaxel + trastuzumab again) may be considered as one treatment.\nMeasurable or non-measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be measured accurately in at least one diameter, that is 20 mm using conventional imaging techniques (including incremental CT) or 10 mm using spiral CT equipment and a lymph node 15 mm along the short axis. Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm pathological a lymph nodes with 10 to less than 15mm along the short axis, bony metastases, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast cancer, lymphangitis carcinomatosis, and heavily calcified and cystic/necrotic lesions.\nLVEF \u2265 50%\nHematologic",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Achieving pathological complete response (pCR) after chemotherapy is the most important prognostic factor for these patients. However, patients with pCR can suffer relapse. In parallel, long-term prognosis of patients who do not achieve pCR is poorly documented, and no specific prognostic factors have been clearly identified.Preclinical and clinical studies argue for an immunogenic role of some chemotherapy regimens, such as anthracyclines, taxanes or trastuzumab. By facilitating recruitment of CD8 T-lymphocytes in the tumour bed, these agents could favourably influence antitumour immune response, partially contributing to efficacy. Conversely, tumours can promote accumulation of regulatory T-lymphocytes expressing Foxp3, thus evading anti-tumour immune response, and increased numbers of regulatory T-cells are associated with less favourable prognosis in breast cancer patients. We have previously shown that a high number of CD8 T-cells associated with low Foxp3 infiltration, as quantified by immunohistochemistry on surgical specimens, is associated with better response and better survival in breast cancer patients, independently of whether pCR was achieved, the type of chemotherapy used, and the type of breast cancer. Therefore, we propose to validate in a prospective study this immunological prognostic marker in a large cohort of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria\nSigned informed consent\nSocial security coverage\nAge between 18 and 80 years\nHistologically proven breast cancer, regardless of histological type or molecular subtype (triple negative, hormone-receptor positive, HER2+++), including inflammatory forms\nLocalised breast cancer with or without axillary or subclavicular lymph node involvement\nAbsence of bone or visceral metastasis on further evaluation (bone scintigraphy, chest X-ray, abdominal echocardiography or CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvic area)\nTreatment by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment protocol at physician's discretion)\nPatient amenable to receiving adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy)\nBreast surgery (breast-sparing or not) planned after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\nexclusion criteria\nMetastatic breast cancer\nNeoadjuvant radiotherapy\nPatient not amenable to surgery\nOngoing therapy for any other type of cancer\nLegal incapacity (incarceration or persons under legal guardianship)\nPatient unable to sign the informed consent or unable to attend medical follow-up for geographical, social or mental reasons.\n\n```Here is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Predictors of Response to Neoadjuvant Docetaxel-Carboplatin Chemotherapy for Patients With Stage II and III Triple Negative Breast Cancer\n\nSummary: Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy is an interesting research tool which allows investigators to test new drugs and/or new schedules with a validated surrogate endpoint, pCR. It also represents an ideal model to evaluate the relationships between treatments and tumor biomarkers. Recent publications have shown that new molecular classifications of breast cancer (intrinsic subtypes) have an important prognostic and predictive value. Using microarrays for gene expression profiling seems to be the best way to perform this classification; nevertheless such assays are not optimally available for common clinical practice. The IHC-based classification systems are still useful, as fresh tissue is not normally available in clinical practice, and has been shown to correlate well with intrinsic classification using gene expression microarrays. Recently the PAM50 gene set provided a risk of relapse score not only in ER-positive, node negative patients (similarly to the Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score) but also in the ER negative disease. Additionally, the PAM 50 assay was highly predictive of neoadjuvant response when considering all patients. This assay added significant prognostic and predictive value to pathologic staging, histologic grade, and standard clinical molecular markers while using an easy technique that can be performed in clinical practice because the qRT-PCR assay can be performed using FFEP tissue.~Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of ER, PgR and HER-2. DNA microarray profiling studies have led to the classification of invasive breast carcinoma into five subtypes: luminal A and B, normal breast-like, HER2/neu overexpressing and basal-like subtypes, with clinical implications. Later on, a new subtype, the claudin-low, has been described. Although not synonymous, the majority of TNBCs carry the basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) molecular profile.~The triple negative subtype accounts for 11-20% of breast cancer in different studies, whereas in selected cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer or African-American ethnicity, TNBC may be diagnosed among as many as 23-28%.~Patients with TN breast tumors treated with standard chemotherapy have a shorter DFS and OS than non-TN ones. The largest study exploring response and survival in early stage breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported by Liedtke et al. Although an increase pCR rate was observed among the TN patients, they had a significantly shorter survival associated with TNBC compared with non-TN ones. This demonstrates that poor OS is derived from chemo-resistant patients (what unfortunately represent > 50% of them).~A relevant problem is the differential response to drugs of TN tumors. These tumors are usually treated with multidrug combinations including anthracyclines and taxanes, with pCR\u00b4s of 28-32%. Only recently, the results of a few small trials combining platinum salts and taxanes have been reported, with encouraging results (pCR of 44-77%). The taxane-platinum salt combinations have a biological background, since TN not associated BRCA1 mutations are sensitive to taxanes and resistant to platinum salts are effective in TN tumors probably because a significant proportion of them have functional DNA repair deficiencies.~The primary objective of the study is to identify predictors of response to docetaxel-carb",

But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities.

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nWilling and able give written informed consent.\nPreviously untreated (adjuvant interferon is acceptable), and histologically confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma with at least 2 metastatic lesions, (one amenable to resection that measures over 0.75 cm3 by volume AND another amenable to 3 X core biopsy OR resection that measures over 0",

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. Investigational means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved this drug for use patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer in this research study.~The use of T-DM1 in this research study is experimental, which means it is not approved by any regulatory authority for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, it FDA-approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 has caused cancer cells to die in laboratory studies. In preclinical studies, this drug has prevented or slowed the growth of breast cancer. The breast cancer treatments (paclitaxel and Trastuzumab) used in this study are considered part of standard-of-care regimens in early breast cancer. A standard treatment means that this is a treatment that would be accepted by the majority of the medical community as a suitable treatment for your type of breast cancer.~In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if the study drug T-DM1 will have less side effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel. The investigators are also hoping to learn about the long term benefits and disease-free survival of participants who take the study drug T-DM1 in comparison to those participants to take the combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHER2-positive Stage I histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast\nER/PR determination is required\nHER2 positive, confirmed by central testing: IHC 3+, FISH HER2/CEP17 <2.0 with an average HER2 copy number >/=6.0, or FISH HER2/CEP17 >/= 2.0\nBilateral breast cancers that individually meet eligibility criteria are allowed\nSubjects with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible as long as each tumor individually meets eligibility criteria\nShould have tumor tissue available and a tissue block of sufficient size to make 15 slides, which must be sent to a DFCI site for testing\nLess than or equal to 90 days since most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer\nAll tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy) with either a sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection\nAll margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS\nMay have received up to 4 weeks of tamoxifen therapy or other hormonal therapy, for adjuvant therapy for this cancer\nPrior oophorectomy for cancer prevention is allowed\nSubjects who have undergone partial breast radiation (duration </= 7 days) prior to registration are eligible.

The investigators plan to evaluate several different questions by comparing gene profiles in different phases of treatment in this study. These are outlined below.~Hypotheses~Chemotherapy enriches for tumor cell populations that have enhanced resistance and survival mechanisms. These mechanisms will in part be identifiable through changes in gene expression profiles pre vs. post treatment.~Use of two distinct chemotherapy selection pressures, for example a DNA-damaging regimen (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) or a mitotic spindle/metabolic targeted regimen (docetaxel and capecitabine), will allow for the identification of a smaller set of genes associated to resistance and survival mechanisms of broad importance.~Genes associated with enrichment for resistance and survival mechanisms will not be present in large amounts pretreatment in tumors destined for complete pathologic response.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nWritten informed consent\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer can be made by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), core, or tru-cut biopsy.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast associated with the following clinical stage: IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC; patients with stage IV disease are also eligible if there is an intention to perform breast surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is completed, or in patients participating in clinical trials where surgery after neoadjuvant therapy may be an option (eg.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nDisease Criteria:\nALL in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplant. Remission is defined as less than 5.0% bone marrow lymphoblasts by morphology, as determined by a bone marrow aspirate obtained within 2 weeks of study registration.\nPhiladelphia chromosome positive ALL is allowed.\nLymphoid blastic crisis of CML will be included (provided that patients achieve CR).\nAge Criteria: Equal or above age 40 and up to 6",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for myelofibrosis (a disease of the bone marrow), but its safety and efficacy in breast cancer patients is not known. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an FDA-approved treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. The safety and efficacy of both treatments given in combination is not known. It is hypothesized that Ruxolitinib in combination with Trastuzumab will demonstrate efficacy in treating Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer subjects, and will have a tolerable safety profile in this patient population.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nSubjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to any local treatment with curative intent. Metastatic disease must be demonstrated either radiographically or histologically.\nPrimary tumors and/or metastatic lesions must demonstrate HER2-neu overexpression, per the 2013 recommendations, i.e. immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or amplification by in situ hybridization based on the following:\nSingle-probe average HER2 copy number \u22656.0 signals/cell\nDual-probe HER2/Chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) ratio \u22652.0 with an average HER2 copy number \u22654.0 signals/cell\nDual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio \u22652.0 with an average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals/cell\nDual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with an average HER2 copy number > 6.0 signals/cell\nPatients should have measurable disease only, non-measurable disease only, or both (RECIST 1.1). Concomitant treatment with bone-targeted therapies such as Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitors or bisphosphonates is allowed. It is anticipated that most patients will have measurable disease, given the behavior of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.\nBecause no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ruxolitinib in combination with trastuzumab in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\nWomen and men of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky equal to or greater than 60)\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50 percent by transthoracic echocardiography or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 28 days prior to the first dose of the study drug.\nThe subject has a baseline corrected QT interval less than or equal to 480ms.\nAspartate Aminotransferase (AST/SGOT)/ Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 time institutional upper limit of normal.\nSerum creatinine less than or equal to 1.",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

The aim of the GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies.~Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced anaemia.~The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the use of parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with iron deficiency.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients will be eligible for study participation only if they comply with the following criteria:\nWritten informed consent according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.\nComplete baseline documentation must be submitted via MedCODES to GBG Forschungs GmbH.\nUnilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration from the breast lesion alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy or axillary clearance is not allowed.\nIn patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured.\nCentrally confirmed ER, PR and HER2 status. Central pathology includes also assessment of Ki-67 and LPBC status on core biopsy. ER/PR negative is defined as <=1% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH) and according to ASCO-CAP guidelines as of 2013). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology laboratory prior to randomization.\nAge >=18 years.\nKarnofsky Performance status index 90%.\nConfirmed normal cardiac function by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening fraction) within 4 weeks prior to randomization. LVEF must be above 55%.\nNegative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all women of childbearing potential.\nComplete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (21 days), breast MRI (optional). Chest X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan in case of high risk for primary metastasis. In case of a positive bone scan, bone X-ray or CT scan is mandatory.\nPatients must agree with central pathology testing of core biopsy specimen and final pathology specimen and be available and compliant for treatment and follow-up.\nIn addition for patients to be randomized to the two supportive anemia treatment arms:\nHemoglobin level <10g/dl.\nBody weight \u2265 40 kg.\nNo need for immediate red blood cell transfusion.\nTransferrin s",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of the Intralesional Recombinant Human Epidermal Growth Factor (rhEGF) in Subjects With Diabetic Foot Ulcer.\n\nSummary: Phase III clinical trial, multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind, with two parallel groups (experimental and control). Both study groups will receive standard therapy currently available in treatment centers for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Associate with the standard therapy, it will be given the recombinant human Epidermal Growth Factor (rhEGF) to experimental group and in the control group, it will be given a formulation without pharmacological effect (placebo) in order to masking and control of intralesional application. Participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnosed with DFU for at least 4 weeks, treated in referral centers participating in the study, agreeing to participate after reading, understanding and signing of Informed Consent (IC); meet all the inclusion criteria; and presenting no exclusion criteria. The Informed Consent (IC) should be applied to potential participants, as recommended by the regulations and ethical consensus before beginning any procedure related to the clinical trial. In the early weeks, participants will be evaluated at the research centers by the study team (doctors and / or staff). The number of visits will be determined by the investigator, thus ensuring appropriate assistance to participants, and avoiding any complications with DFU. By meeting the eligibility requirements (inclusion and exclusion criteria), the participant will undergo a thorough evaluation of the DFU before the start of treatment. This assessment is precisely to classify the condition of the ulcer before treatment and provide relevant information for statistical analysis of the protocol. If eligible, the participant will be randomly set to treatment arm (placebo or rhEGF) and the administration of investigational product associated with predefined standardized outpatient therapy will be initiated. This administration occurs three times per week until the DFU is scarred, not exceeding 8 weeks of treatment (T.01 to T.08) .The study will be randomized and balanced according to the type and size of the DFU. This balancing is necessary to ensure that both treatment groups are homogeneous for participants under different conditions. All participants will be applied established standard therapy for the treatment of DFU. The objective is to provide regular care for healing and reduce possible bias in the efficacy analysis and product safety. After the treatment period (last dose of the experimental drug) the participant will start the follow-up period, with 16 weeks duration. The participant shall be subjected to weekly visits for ongoing assessment of DFU, however, according to the investigator, may result in unscheduled visits to assess local or general clinical events. After the monitoring period, the participant will be observed for 24 additional weeks, visits every 4 weeks (E.01 E.24 a) having beginning one week after the last visit of follow-up. This period is intended to assess possible events related to the efficacy and safety that can happen in the period, mainly for analysis of secondary endpoints.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nDM type 1 or 2 diagnosis\nDFU persisting for a minimum of 4 weeks If the consented participant is classified as having infection grade 3 without the presence of osteomyelitis, it will be possible to treat it with antibiotics empirically. However, randomization will be made only after this treatment and only if the infection has regressed to grade 1 or 2;\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should",

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Denosumab as an add-on Neoadjuvant Treatment (GeparX)\n\n\nSummary: Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models.~In a retrospective analysis it could be demonstrated that elevated expression of RANK was found in 14.5% of patients overall, with a significant predominance in patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease. Expression of RANK was associated with a higher pathological complete response rate but with a shorter disease-free and overall survival. The ABCSG-18 study showed that adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fractures, improves bone health, and can be administered without added toxicity.~It appears therefore reasonable to test denosumab, a clinically available antibody against RANKL in patients with hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to increase pCR rate and improve outcome in relation to the expression of RANK.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria:\nUnilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration from the breast lesion alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy or axillary clearance is not allowed. In case tumor isn't measurable by sonography, then MRI or mammography is sufficient. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used as measurable lesion.\nPatients must have stage cT1c - cT4a-d disease.\nIn patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured.\nCentrally confirmed ER-negative and PR-negative status. Central pathology includes also assessment of HER2, Ki-67, TIL and RANK status on core biopsy. ER/PR negative is defined as \u22641% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH) and according to ASCO-CAP guidelines as of 2013. LPBC (lymphocyte predominant breast cancer) is defined as more than 50% stromal tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology laboratory prior to randomization.\nExclusion criteria:\nPatients with stages cT1a, cT1b, or any M1.\nPrior chemotherapy for any malignancy.\nPrior radiation therapy for breast cancer.\nHistory of disease with influence on bone metabolism, such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, primary hyperparathyroidism requiring treatment at the time of randomization or considered likely to become necessary within the subsequent six months.\nUse of bisphosphonates or denosumab within the past 1 year.\nSignificant dental/oral disease, including prior history or current evidence of osteonecrosis/ osteomyelitis of the jaw, active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, planned invasive dental procedure for the course of the study.\nPrevious malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of the cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).\nKnown or suspected congestive heart failure (>NYHA I) and",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Despite the improvement in early detection and therapeutic arsenal, the mortality of this cancer remains high with 11 886 deaths estimated in 2012. Breast cancer is most often a carcinoma born from the lobular or ductal epithelium and is classified In two main categories: non invasive and invasive. Invasive breast cancers account for 75% of the cases. They are usually ductal (75%) and more rarely lobular (25%). The cancer cells are then no longer circumscribed to the galactophoric canals or glands but have invaded neighboring tissues. If they are not treated in time, these cancers can then spread: the cancerous cells will then migrate either by the lymphatic vessels to reach the neighboring ganglia or through the blood vessels to give metastases in other tissues In the liver, lungs and bones). The mortality associated with breast cancer is not due to the growth of the primary tumor but rather to the occurrence of metastases. The study of the mechanisms leading to metastatic invasion (i.e. migration and invasion) is therefore of considerable importance. The development of metastases depends on the acquisition by the cancer cells of various capacities including that of being able to migrate, involving a remodeling of the cytoskeleton highly dependent on the intracellular calcium (Ca2 +) concentration. Several types of signals are able to induce mobilization of Ca2 + from the extracellular medium or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reserves. At the intracellular level, some of these signals are generated by inositol (1,4,5) -trisphosphate (IP3) from the activation of G protein-coupled receptors or certain receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Has been shown that the expression, activity and regulation of IP3R receptors (IP3Rs) are involved in the cancerous processes of many tissues, in particular in the phenomena of proliferation of breast cancer cells. Overall, altered expression and / or activity of IP3Rs can be used for the survival, growth, proliferation and migration of cancer cells.~In the laboratory, the investigator showed that regulation of the expression of subtype 3 (IP3R3) by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) is involved in the growth of the human mammary cancer line MCF-7. E2 triggers the release of Ca2 + in an IP3-dependent mechanism, while prolonged exposure to E2 leads to an increase in the expression of IP3R3. At the same time, the reduction in the expression of IP3R3 cancels the proliferative effect of E2 on MCF-7 cells. More recently, the investigator has established that IP3R3 regulates the proliferation of cells of the human MCF-7 mammary cancer cell line via a molecular and functional interaction with the Ca2 + -dependent BKCa potassium channel. The determination of IP3Rs, including subtype 3, as a mediator / marker of breast carcinogenesis appears to be a major clinical issue.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nCCI / CLI to be operated\nGrade SBR 1, 2 or 3\nUndifferentiated RE / PR status\nHER2 status undifferentiated\nKi 67 indifferent\nMetastatic or not\nAD",

We have discovered two novel classes of DCIS molecular markers that will serve as the basis for the candidate molecules to be evaluated in this proposed study. The first class of DCIS molecular markers is autophagy, a cell survival mechanism that we discovered to be highly augmented in the hypoxic and nutrient deprived intraductal neoplastic cells of human DCIS (1-4). The second class of biomarker is calcium efflux that is mediated in breast cells by the calcium export pump Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase (PMCA2) (5, 6). During normal lactation, breast epithelium pumps large concentrations of calcium into milk. In neoplastic lesions, calcium is exported by PMCA2 as a cell survival mechanism, since cells under metabolic stress accumulate calcium to a toxic level. Calcium export in DCIS may also contribute to intraductal calcifications, a hallmark of",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Neratinib +/- Fulvestrant in HER2+, ER+ Metastatic Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: This research study is studying a drug called Neratinib with and without Fulvestrant as possible treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer .~The interventions involved in this study are:~Neratinib and Fulvestrant~Neratinib alone\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nParticipants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer. To fulfill the requirement for ER+ disease, a breast cancer must express, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ER in \u226510% of cells, on the most recent biopsy. If ER quantification is not available, a determination of ER+ by IHC will suffice. Central confirmation of ER status is not required.\nParticipants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.). These therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy.\nTrastuzumab\nPertuzumab\nAdo-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)\nParticipants must agree to undergo a research biopsy of a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion (chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes, skin, breast, bones, lung, and liver metastases). If a reasonably accessible site is available for biopsy, the patient must agree to biopsy. Any patients not undergoing biopsy must have available tissue [archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB), blocks from which slides can be created, or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic setting] for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time of registration See Section 9.3 for more details.\nWomen \u2265 18 years of age. Men are not eligible.\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (see Appendix A).\nParticipants may have received any number of prior therapies as long as they have adequate performance status and meet all other eligibility criteria.\nWomen of childbearing potential (including premenopausal women and women less than 12 months after menopause) must have a negative \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine pregnancy test within 4 weeks of registration.\nThe effects of neratinib and fulvestrant on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because SERD agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to be abstinent, or to use a highly effective double barrier method of contraception (e.g., a combination of male condom with an intravaginal device such as the cervical cap, diaphragm, or vaginal sponge with spermicide) or a non-hormonal method, while enrolled in the study, until at least 28 days after the last dose of neratinib or 1 year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a woman is of childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for one year after completion of the study drug.\nAbility to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nLet'",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV).

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of OAB symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nBe willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.\nBe 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\nPatients must have metastatic confirmed breast cancer\nDisease progression by radiological techniques within 12 months prior to signing informed consent.\nHave measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.\nPrior chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxanes has to be administered in neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.\nHave a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale.\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\nMale subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.111.2 - Contraception, starting with the first dose",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of OAB symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nFemale\nAge >/= 45 years\nUnicentric pathological stage I (pT1 or T2 pN0_M0) invasive ductal breast cancer or DCIS measuring <3 cm in longest diameter on pathology and/or mammogram that is histologically confirmed.

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking certain proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which are needed for cell growth. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can keep PARP from working so tumor cells can't repair themselves and grow.

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV).

Stents are typically made from polymeric materials including Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyglycolide (PGA), Polydioxanone (PDO), Polyethyleneglycol (PEG), Polycaprolactone (PCL), etc., which have been cleared or approved by the FDA and CE-marked as drug carriers, sutures, and bone fixatives. The material is degraded by hydrolysis in, e.g., lactic acid, which is removed from the body by normal metabolic pathways. In the field of gastroenterology, these stents were first introduced in patients with an esophageal stenosis with encouraging results, although esophageal hyperplasia was a frequently encountered complication.~For biliary applications, biodegradable stents have been evaluated in several in-vitro and animal studies that demonstrated that the stents were safe and well tolerated. These stents provided an adequate radial force and resulted in complete stricture resolution within several months. The stents did not show any signs of biliary hyperplasia or integration in the epithelium. Moreover, they seem to have a self-clearing effect on attached biofilm as the outer layer sloughs during the degradation process similarly to the exfoliation of human skin. Also, the stent could be removed from the bile duct, thus offering the possibility of extraction if necessary at various times after implantation.~In 2010, Petryl was the first to use a biodegradable stent in the human bile duct. A stent was successfully placed using percutaneous transhepatic cholangiograpy in two patients with a postsurgical intrahepatic biliary stricture. Transient cholangitis was the only complication encountered and during the two years of follow-up, the bile duct remained patent.~Later, Mauri et al. presented in 2013 and 2016 results of a 107 patient study on a polydioxanone biodegradable biliary stent. The results have been published in the Journal of the European Society of Radiology. The authors concluded without any device-related SAE. Bilirubin was reduced by 25.6%, which exceeded the >20% clinical success criterion, quality of life score improved from 3.7 to 7.9, procedural success was rated 1.4 (good to excellent), and technical success was achieved in all 107 patients.~Data from the ARCHIMEDES Investigational study was used for CE Mark approval, which was obtained in June 2018.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatient eligible for implantation of a pancreatic or billiary stent prior to participate in the study and according to current guidelines\nPatient has provided a signed and dated informed consent (according to the laws and regualtions of the country in which the observational study is conducted)\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level el",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management and Avoidance (CHARISMA)\n\n\nSummary: RATIONALE:~Atherothrombosis is a progressive and generalized vascular disease resulting in events leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and vascular death.~In patients at risk for this disease, it is characterized by an unpredictable, sudden disruption of atherosclerotic plaques, which may lead to total occlusion of artery due to formation of a clot. The use of aspirin (blood thinner agent) for reducing those major ischemic events is either indicated, or recommended by international guidelines. However, aspirin fails to prevent a high percentage of such life-threatening events. Therefore, more effective blood thinning therapy may provide additional clinical benefit to such patients.~The results of the CURE trial in patients with unstable angina demonstrate the additional benefit of long-term treatment (up to one year) with clopidogrel, (a blood thinner agent), when administered in combination with standard therapy including aspirin therapy (75-162 mg daily). Such population includes patients with previous cardiovascular, neurovascular or peripheral arterial manifestations of atherothrombosis and patients with combinations of recognized risk factors for atherosclerosis.~OBJECTIVES:~To assess the efficacy of clopidogrel 75 mg once-daily by comparison with a placebo, in preventing cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. The study will compare the efficacy of the two regimens in preventing the occurrence of major cardiovascular complications (stroke, heart attack, cardiovascular death) in high-risk patients who are otherwise receiving low-dose aspirin therapy (75-162 mg daily).\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION:\nBe at least 45 years old and comply with at least one of the four categories of inclusion criteria:\nCombination of atherothrombotic risk factors (2 major or 3 minor or 1 major + 2 minor risk factors among those listed below)\nMajor atherothrombotic risk factors\nType I or II diabetes (under drug therapy)\nDiabetic nephropathy\nAnkle brachial index (ABI) < 0.9\nAsymptomatic carotid stenosis >= 70%\nAt least one",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities.

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge > 18 and < 90 years\nCapacity for giving written informed consent\nCarotid stenosis of > 30% by ultrasound criteria\nLDL cholesterol level of > 100mg/dl\nSystolic BP < 170 and diastolic BP < 100 under resting conditions\nNegative pregnancy test if female of child-bearing potential\n\n```Here is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Their pharmacologic use for this purpose is limited, however, by their actions on other organs, including the heart, bone, and brain, where there can be side effects of excessive thyroid hormone action. 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a thyroid hormone analog with relative selectivity for a form of the thyroid hormone receptor expressed in the liver, where it regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism, including the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.~This study is designed to determine whether DITPA is safe and effective in achieving LDL cholesterol levels that are consistent with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines in patients who have not achieved those levels on conventional therapy, due to drug-resistant disease, drug intolerance, or both.~This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a 4-week Pre-Randomization Phase with dietary counseling and a 2-week placebo run-in, eligible patients will be randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive DITPA (90 mg/day, 180 mg/day), or placebo for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.~Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 90 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for 10 weeks.~Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 180 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first 2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for the next 2 weeks, and then 180 mg/day for 8 weeks.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients are eligible for study entry based on the following criteria:\nMales or females greater than or equal to 18 years of age\nFemales must not be pregnant or lactating.

Thus, in August 2005, the guidelines for the treatment of lipid disorders (NCEP ATPIII) were revised to indicate that an LDL-C treatment goal of 70 mg/dL (revised from 100 mg/dL) was optional for patients with known CHD. In these same guidelines, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) are also suggested but not specifically proscribed as a target of therapy. Recently the ARBITER 2 trial has provided the first evidence of the potential of raising HDL-C with extended release niacin when added to statin monotherapy. However, whether this approach would be superior to a strategy in which lower concentrations of LDL-C are targeted is unknown.~The purpose of ARBITER 6 - HALTS is to compare HDL and LDL-focused strategies of lipid treatments for their effects of atherosclerosis. This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial comparing treatment strategies of either HDL-raising therapies or LDL reduction for dyslipidemia on carotid atherosclerosis. Subjects with known atherosclerotic coronary or vascular disease or otherwise at high cardiovascular risk through the presence of a coronary risk equivalent who are currently being treated with a statin will be eligible. Subjects will be randomly assigned in an allocation-concealed fashion to open label treatment with either Ezetimibe 10 mg/d for additional LDL-lowering OR Extended-release niacin (1 gm/d, titrated to max tolerable dose up to 2 gm/d) for HDL improvement.~The effects of these 2 different strategies of intensified lipid management on atherosclerosis will be assessed by the change in the carotid intima-media thickness, a validated surrogate endpoint. The data will help guide clinicians on the potential benefits of these lipid treatment strategies.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMale and female subjects, \u2265 30 years old with either known atherosclerotic coronary or v",

Antihypertensive therapy with \u00df-blockers (\u00dfBs) and diureticts (Ds) is accompanied by a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) than therapy with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Whether this difference is due to an antidiabetogenic action of ACEIs and ARBs or to the fact that these agents are free of the diabetogenic activity of \u00dfBs and Ds is unknown. Prevention of DM as well as of HT is of primary health concern.~Objectives. The primary objective of PHIDIAS is to test whether in individuals with components of metabolic syndrome making them predisposed to DM and HT, addition of either an ACEI or an ARB to periodically reinforced lifestyle counselling can reduce 1) onset of DM and 2) onset of HT significantly more than lifestyle plus placebo. Secondary objectives are 1) comparing the antidiabetogenic effects of ACEI and ARB, and 2) investigating whether the effects of ACEI and ARB on DM and HT persist at least 6 months after treatment withdrawal.~Methods. PHIDIAS is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm comparison trial. 300 general practitioners (members of SIMG with the assistance of hospital centres of SIIA) will randomise 6000 untreated individuals aged 40-75 years, with SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89 mmHg, fasting glucose (FG) 100-125 mg/dl, waist circumference >= 102 (M) or >= 88 cm (W), to three blinded treatments, given in addition to lifestyle advise: 1) Placebo; 2) the ACE Enalapril (10 mg, then 20 mg od); 3) the ARB Losartan (50 mg, then 100 mg od).Double-blind treatment will be maintained until 500 cases of DM are observed (presumably average of 36 months) (Treatment Phase: control visits, BP, FG every 6 months). This will be followed by a 6-month Withdrawal Phase (active treatment substituted by placebo). Primary out",

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure\u00b4s safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST and ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade stenosis. However, particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications, which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be applicable any more. We hypothesized that protected CAS has a beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological complications and major adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic >80% internal carotid artery stenoses. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to analyze neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with elective CAS plus best medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAtherosclerosis is the underlying disease\nPatients with an asymptomatic stenosis >80% (NASCET) with a documented progression of the degree of stenosis to >80% within 6 months with a very tight stenosis \u226590% at initial presentation with a >80% stenosis plus silent ipsilateral ischemia documented by CCT or MRI with ipsilateral >80% stenosis plus contralateral >80% stenosis",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure,",

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nStenosis of 70% or more by carotid artery duplex, CTA or MRA.\nNo evidence of TIA or CVA originating in area of the brain supplied by the carotid artery under study, in the four months preceding treatment.\nEligibility for both treatment options:\nsuited for operative treatment as assessed by an anesthesiologist\nsuited for endovascular procedure by established radiological guidelines (including: access to the stenotic area via the vessels of the aortic arch, the absence of occlusion preventing this access, absence of torturous anatomy of the",

He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Evaluation of the Remote Intervention for Diet and Exercise (RIDE)\n\n\nSummary: A large proportion of the adult population in the United States qualifies for weight loss treatment based on the NIH treatment recommendations, but traditional clinic-based weight loss treatments have a number of limitations. For example, access to healthcare facilities is limited among people living in rural communities and people of low socioeconomic status, yet a disproportionate number of these people would benefit from services. Internet-based weight loss interventions have been used to deliver services to these populations, but these e-Health interventions suffer from a number of limitations and produce only modest weight loss. The limitations associated with internet-based interventions include decreased use of the internet application over time; patients must logon to the internet to receive treatment recommendations, yet few patients regularly logon to the application and this negatively affects treatment outcome. An additional limitation is the quality of self-reported food intake, exercise, and body weight data that participants enter into the internet application or report to their online counselor. Self-reported data are associated with error and accurate data are needed to formulate effective treatment recommendations for participants. Lastly, most applications rely on asynchronous communications between the patient and the counselor, and patients do not always receive personalized treatment recommendations in a reasonable amount of time (1 to 3 days), which limits the extent to which the recommendations result in behavior change and weight loss.~The purpose of the proposed pilot and feasibility project is to test the efficacy of the Remote Intervention for Diet and Exercise (RIDE) e-Health application at promoting weight loss compared to a control condition. The RIDE e-Health application addresses the limitations of internet-based interventions that are noted above. The application relies on novel technology to collect near real-time food intake, body weight, and exercise data from participants while they reside in their free-living environments. These data are transmitted to the researchers in near real-time: food intake data are collected and transmitted with camera and Bluetoothenabled cell phones using the Remote Food Photography method that was developed by this laboratory, body weight data is automatically transmitted daily from a bathroom scale using the same phones, and accelerometry is used to collect exercise data that is transmitted via the internet. These data are analyzed and personalized treatment recommendations are sent to the participant in a timely manner, e.g., every 1 to 3 days, using the cell phones. The RIDE e-Health application was developed based on learning and behavioral theory to maximize behavior change and weight loss. The",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

People with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, have worse physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Number of epidemiological studies of patients with schizophrenia have documented a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease(CVD) than in the general population, and patients with schizophrenia may be at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease even in the absence of antipsychotic treatment.~Affinity for the H1 receptor is most closely linked to increased weight gain, although affinity for D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and a2-receptors may also be involved. Drug affinity for the H1, M3 and 5-HT2C receptors is correlated with an increased risk of diabetes.~High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration in the blood is independently and inversely associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD). However many patients with 'normal' or even 'elevated' plasma HDL experience clinical events. HDL inhibits the chemotaxis of monocytes , prevents endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, prohibit slow-density lipoprotein (LDL ) oxidation, and stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. These anti-in\ufb02ammatory, antioxidative, antiaggregatory, anti-coagulant, and pro-\ufb01brinolytic activities are exerted by different components of HDL~Aim of the study:~To investigate the functional properties of HDL in psychiatric patients before and during antipsychotic therapy.~Patients and methods:~The blood will be drawn at baseline before the initiation of antipsychotic drugs and 2 months under the antipsychotic treatment.~Study procedures:~Full lipid profile including triglycerides, LDL-C, Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo AI and PAF.~Serum Paraoxanase Activity~LDL oxidation and resistance to oxidation (me",

The primary outcome will be a MACE-free survival. The secondary outcomes will be MACE, cardiac death, TLR (target lesion revascularization) and TVR (target vessel revascularization). Imaging endpoints will be assessed pre-, post- procedure and at 12-month follow-up (by the Amendment of August 29th 2012). At the first subset, patients underwent stenting with XIENCE V stent proximal to the site of nano-intervention (n=13). Subjects in the second subset were undergone drug-coated balloon pre-dilation with further nano-technique (n=20). Lesions in patients of the third subset were not prepared for the nano-approach (n=147) (neither stenting nor balloon angioplasty). The analysis will be performed and results will be released after 2018 with the same clinical outcomes.~This project and related manuscripts were not prepared or funded in any part by a commercial organization.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s.

These improvements include a reduction in the thickness of the wall of the carotid artery (the main artery that runs up the neck to supply the brain) and a reduction in the stiffness of arteries generally including the main central artery -the aorta. Such medications are in the polypill (the Red Heart Pill) that is being used in the UMPIRE Study.\nInclusion criteria: Patients must meet the inclusion criteria for the UMPIRE trial, and be consented to take part in the PESCA sub-study.\nInclusion criteria\nIndividuals are eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria are satisfied:\nAdults (\u2265 18 years) The participant is able to give informed consent.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Ultrasound and Other Images of Artery Blockages\n\n\nSummary: Background:~- Treatments for partly blocked carotid arteries are determined by a person s symptoms and by tests that show how severe the blockage is. Studies show that the material that blocks an artery is more important in spotting future problems than how tight the blockage is. Researchers want to develop better imaging studies to find which blockages are more high-risk.~Objectives:~- To use imaging studies to look at high-risk carotid artery blockages.~Eligibility:~- Individuals at least 21 years of age whose ultrasound exams show a major carotid artery blockage.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, , an ultrasound scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.~Participants will have ultrasound and other scans to obtain pictures of the arteries. The scans will use drugs that may help study doctors get a better picture of the blood vessels and blockages.~Participants will have followup phone calls yearly for 3 years. If a participant later has surgery to remove the blockage, the surgeon will save part of it for future study.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nInclusion Criteria for Group A:\nAdult subjects age greater than or equal to 21 years\nAble to give written informed consent\nPrior clinical ultrasound exam showing a carotid stenosis of greater than or equal to 50 percent\nInclusion Criteria for Group B:\nAdult subjects age greater than or equal to 21 years\nAble to give written informed consent\nPrior clinical ultrasound exam showing a carotid stenosis suspected of causing symptoms and/or clinical recommendation to undergo carotid endarterectomy\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\nAtrial fibrillation or other irregular rhythm that would preclude adequate image acquisition\nSubjects with a contraindication for the ultrasound contrast agent.\nSubjects with pacemakers, defibrillators, cerebral aneurysm clips, neural stimulators, ear implants or other clinical contra-indications for magnetic resonance scanning will be excluded from the MRI portion of the study.\nThe eGFR will be used to estimate renal function if reported by the laboratory.

Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Study of TARCEVA (Erlotinib) as Adjuvant Treatment for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n\n\nSummary: This trial was originally designed and powered to compare biomarker modulation in the neo-adjuvant setting (erlotinib versus erlotinib plus sulindac versus placebo) with clinical response to erlotinib in the adjuvant setting. Since implementing the trial in late 2005, The investigators have encountered significant obstacles to implementing the adjuvant therapy phase of the trial.~Barriers included:~disease recurrence~patient refusal to take the agent~patient refusal to travel to Pittsburgh for clinical evaluations.~Given the institutional challenges to implement and complete the adjuvant portion, the investigators have decided to change the primary endpoint to a biomarker modulation endpoint. To achieve this goal patients on this trial will be randomly assigned to one of three arms to receive either Tarceva, Tarceva plus sulindac, or a placebo in the 2 week pre-operative period. A panel of biomarkers will be obtained by biopsy prior to pre-operative therapy and again at surgery. Biomarkers will be examined for modulation in the 2-week pre-operative period, for group differences, for treatment effects and for further understanding of protein signaling pathways.~Sample size for the primary objective~Modification of Statistical Design:~The primary endpoint is the difference between pre (biopsy) and post (surgery). There are 3 hypotheses of interest: (1) placebo vs erlotinib alone, (2) placebo versus erlotinib plus sulindac, and (3) erlotinib vs erlotinib + sulindac. With a randomization in a 3:5:5 ratio, we have 88% power, alpha = .01 for an omnibus test to show between-group differences of 1 log exist. This requires 39 patients. Basically, 39 patients will provide the ability to detect a one log difference between any 2 of the 3 groups in pre-post change.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed, previously untreated HNSCC.\nClinical stage II, III or IVA disease without distant metastasis, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System, Sixth edition (See Appendix I).\nPrimary tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypoph",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of OAB symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHad received Transcranial Doppolar Sonography.\nAge >40 years old.\nGender: Male or female.\nThe subject or their legal representative gave written informed consent to participate.\nMeet with one of the two Transcranial Doppolar Sonography results below:\nThe evaluated standard of MCA M1 stenosis of 50-99% are as follows:\nPSV >140 cm/s\nMFV >100 cm/s\nThe evaluated standard of BA stenosis of 50-99% are as follows:\nPSV >100 cm/s\nMFV >60 cm/s\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Elig",

The RC has strong elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and is designed to be delivered as a psycho-educational class by non-professionals to improve mood. Depressive symptoms are common, especially in low-income, minority communities. Depressive symptoms that don't meet DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression still carry a significant amount of disability. Interventions that address sub-threshold depressive symptoms have been noted to result in a decreased likelihood of depression and diminished use of mental health services. Few interventions using a health education / health promotion focus are designed to be delivered by non-professionals to address individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms in low income, minority communities. This project will take place in the Centinela Valley, which roughly corresponds to Service Planning Area (SPA) 6 or South Los Angeles (SLA). This single-blind, randomized trial will utilize a wait-list control design where half of the participants enrolled in the study will be randomized to the Resiliency Class (7 sessions) and half will go to a wait-list control condition where they will receive 2 case management calls and referrals to social services. We propose to screen 1500 clients to detect about 450 participants with depressive symptoms (endorsed one item on the PHQ-2). We plan to enroll 400 participants, 200 in the resiliency class and 200 in the wait-list control condition. Primary outcomes measures will include depressive symptoms, function, and measures of resiliency. We will assess these measures at baseline and at 3 months after completion of the Resiliency Class or wait-list control condition. After the completion of the first round of classes, we will conduct a preliminary analysis of the impact of the resiliency classes versus the wait-list control case management calls on depressive symptoms. If the resiliency classes improve depressive symptoms more than the wait-list control case management calls in the randomized trial of this project.\nInclusion criteria: B-RICH Phase I, Pilot Inclusion Criteria\nAge 18 or older\nEndorse one of the first two items on the PHQ-8: In the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

According to the clinical study ATTICA, conducted during the years 2001-2002, in which randomized 1514 men and 1528 women, rates of hypercholesterolemia observed in a sample of urban population was 39% for men and 37% women . The relationship between cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be quite clear in the secondary prevention trials, the 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), CARE (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events) and LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) which showed the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease. Despite these remarkable results, studies were secondary prevention as a major shortcoming, the lack of patients with acute coronary events. This gap came to cover the study MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering). In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80 mg / day increased the latency of the combined primary endpoint, defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia requiring admission to hospital, indicating a risk reduction of 16% (p = 0,048) nationwide with the appearance episode (event) CV.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nOutpatients (External Ambulatory) Patients.\nMale or female patients\n18 to 99 years\nPatients with Hypercholesterolemia\nPatients with and without treatment with statin\nPatients enrolled in any of the study sites with acute cardiovascular event\nPatients discharged with study medication (Antorcin \u00ae)\nPatients who have agreed and signed the consent form for the recording and processing of their personal data.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g.,",

L-carnitine (LC) and coenzyme Q10 is recognized as lipid soluble antioxidants. The purposes of this study are going to investigate the relation of LC and coenzyme Q10 with the markers of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The study is designed as a three-year study. The first year is an observation study. We will recruit CAD patients who are identified by cardiac catheterization as having at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and age-gender matched healthy subjects. The concentrations of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS and ox-LDL), antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase) are going to analysis. The second year is a single-blind, single dose intervention study. We are going to measure the CAD subjects from the second year intervention study. After three months washout period, the subjects are assigned to placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-1000, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-2000, coenzyme Q10-300 plus LC-1000, and coenzyme Q10-300 plus LC-2000 groups. Intervention is going to administration for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention. Hopefully, the results of this study could provide information of LC and coenzyme Q10 supplementation for clinical dietitian in advising CAD patients.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nClinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD): CAD patients were identified as having at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery by cardiac cath",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s.

This finding may imply that atherosclerosis at diabetes diagnosed, is either negligible, or at early, or non-advanced, still modifiable disease stage. However, sparse information is available regarding atherosclerosis prevalence and its characteristics at diabetes presentation. Furthermore, although cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is the major goal of treatment in T2DM, risk assessment tools, mostly based on traditional CV risk factors, lack of adequate specificity to identify individuals at higher risk. Therefore, non-invasive tests, such as carotid ultrasound, have been recommended to better define CV risk in several groups of individuals, including those with intermediate risk or with T2DM.",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score.

Without revascularisation, amputation often is imperative. There is a high technical success rate of endovascular revascularisation of infragenicular arteries with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), but mid- and long-term results are disappointing as restenosis frequently occurs. Drug-eluting balloon (DEB) PTA has been shown to improve patency rates after PTA of coronary arteries.~Aim~To study the results of DEB-PTA compared to conventional balloon CB-PTA for the treatment of infragenicular arterial lesions in patients with CLI.~To evaluate cost-effectiveness of DEB-PTA versus CB-PTA in patients with CLI compared with CB-PTA.~Methodology Multi-center, prospective, randomised parallel-group trial. Patients are eligible for enrolment if they have CLI and at least one infragenicular lesion with a maximal total lesion length of 20cm. Randomisation will be performed on a 1:1 ratio to either DEB-PTA or CB-PTA. Patients will be assessed prior and directly after the intervention, at 3, 6 and 12 months by Rutherford classification, ankle-brachial index, toe pressure and adverse events. Duplex will be performed at 3 months. Angiography will be performed before and directly after PTA and at 6 months. Primary end-point will be primary patency of the treated lesions at 6 months on angiography (defined as <50% luminal loss), secondary end-points are limb salvage at 3, 6 and 12 months, primary patency of the treated lesion on Duplex (defined as PSV \u22642.0 m/sec), Rutherford classification, minor and major amputation, infrapopliteal endovascular re-intervention, peri-procedural complications and death at 3, 6 and 12 months.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nWritten informed consent\nAge > 21 years\nIf female patient with child bearing potential, patient may not be pregnant at the study entry and must utilize reliable birth control for the duration of her participation into the study\nPat",

The concept of MetS represents the pre-cardiovascular and pre-diabetic pathologic conditions, which has been a useful tool in prognosing the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Importantly, interventions applied at the pre-pathologic stage with MetS would be of great clinical and health significance in achieving better preventive and therapeutic outcomes. Yoga, a mind-body exercise, has been suggested to have beneficial effects on dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes. A pilot study has demonstrated the trends in the improvement of metabolic parameters in middle-aged adults with MetS but the findings are inconclusive because of the small sample size and brief yoga follow-up period (i.e., 2-month). In addition to the needs of a better designed randomized controlled trial in studying the beneficial effect of yoga in controlling MetS in middle-aged individuals, the investigation on yoga and MetS in elderly population has been lacking. This is important as the potential use of yoga as lifestyle modification in elderly individuals with MetS will result in significant reduction of the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Thus, this study aims to examine the efficacy of yoga exercise in improving metabolic abnormalities in middle-aged and older adults with MetS. In addition to elderly, middle-aged adults are included in the present investigation because of the idea that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes with aging can be mostly prevented by intervention at the middle-age. A randomized controlled trial with repeated measure design will be conducted to examine the effect of 1-year regular yoga training on the MetS parameters in middle-aged and older individuals who are 30-60 and 60-80 years of age, respectively. Primary outcome measures include waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, triglyceride, and lipid cholesterol profile whereas secondary outcome measures include self-reported stress and depression levels. This study is anticipated to provide valuable information in exploring the therapeutic role of yoga in managing MetS. As yoga exercise is an economical regimen which can be easily and readily applied to large scale of",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Statins at the Primary Care Level\n\n\nSummary: Hypercholesterolemia, a major cause of disease burden in both the developed and developing world, is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths annually (4.5% of all deaths) and one third of ischemic heart diseases., and result in 29.7 million DALY lost. In Argentina, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia increased between 2005 and 2013 from 27.9% to 29.8%, whereas the rate of non-optimal LDL-C, was 28.0%. The rate of high cholesterol awareness was 37.3 % and the proportion of those who are under pharmacological treatment was dismally low: only 11.1%. Furthermore, only one out of four subjects with a self-reported diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) is taking statins. and most individuals with CHD who are on statins have sub-optimal LDL-C levels. Although other antihypertensive, antidiabetic and low-dose aspirin were available free-of-charge at the primary care clinics of the public sector, statins had not been included until recently. As of 2014, statins (simvastatin 20mg) were incorporated into the package of drugs provided free-of-charge for patients with high cholesterol, according to CVD risk stratification. The goal of this study is to test whether a multifaceted educational intervention targeting physicians and pharmacist assistants, improves detection, treatment and control of hypercholesterolemia among uninsured patients with moderate to high cardiovascular risk in Argentina. Specifically, the intervention will test whether a multifaceted educational intervention program lowers LDL-cholesterol levels and CVD risk in moderate to high cardiovascular risk patients, improves physician compliance with clinical practice guidelines, and improves patient care management and adherence to medication. A cost-effectiveness study will be conducted to compare the intervention to the usual standard of care. This randomized cluster trial will enroll 350 patients from 10 public primary care clinics who will be assigned to receive either the intervention or the usual care. This study is timely and will generate urgently needed data on effective and, practical and sustainable intervention programs aimed at the prevention and control of CVD risk that can be directly used in other primary care settings and health care",

Radiation therapy uses high energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Triapine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and cisplatin are more effective with triapine in treating cervical or vaginal cancer.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatient has a new, unrated histologic diagnosis of stage IB2 (> 4 cm), II, IIIB or IVA squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix (FIGO 2009) or stage II-IVA squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the vagina not amenable to curative surgical resection alone; the presence or absence of para-aortic lymph node metastasis will be based on pre-therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT; NOTE: if the baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT identifies hypermetabolic para-aortic disease, such patients will NOT be eligible; the patient must be able to tolerate imaging requirements of an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan\nPatient must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry\nPatient must have a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 or equivalent\nAbsolute neutrophil count > 1,500/uL\nPlatelets > 100,000/uL\nHemoglobin > 10 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin < 2.0 mg",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Stress Echo 2020 - The International Stress Echo Study\n\n\nSummary: Background: Stress echocardiography (SE) has an established role in evidence-based guidelines, but recently the breadth and variety of applications has extended well beyond coronary artery disease (CAD). Purpose: To establish a prospective research study of SE applications, in and beyond CAD, also considering a variety of signs in addition to regional wall motion abnormalities. Methods: In a prospective, multicenter, international, observational study design, > 100 certified high-volume SE labs will be networked with an organized system of clinical, laboratory and imaging data collection at the time of physical or pharmacological SE, with structured follow-up information. The study is endorsed by the Italian Society of Echocardiography and organized in 10 subprojects focusing on: contractile reserve for prediction of cardiac resynchronization or medical therapy response; stress B-lines in heart failure; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; mitral regurgitation after either transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement; outdoor SE in extreme physiology; right ventricular contractile reserve in repaired tetralogy of Fallot; suspected or initial pulmonary arterial hypertension; coronary flow velocity, left ventricular elastance reserve and B-lines in known or suspected CAD; identification of subclinical familial disease in phenotype-negative healthy relatives of patients with familial disease (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Expected Results: To collect about 10,000 patients over a 5-year period (2016-2020), with sample sizes ranging from 5,000 for known or suspected CAD to around 250 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or repaired Fallot. This data base will allow to investigate technical questions such as feasibility and reproducibility of various SE parameters and to assess their prognostic value in different clinical scenarios. Conclusions: The study will create the cultural, informatic and scientific infrastructure connecting high-volume, accredited SE labs, to obtain original safety, feasibility, and outcome data in evidence-poor diagnostic fields, also outside the established core application of SE in CAD based on regional wall motion abnormalities. The study will standardize procedures, validate emerging signs, and integrate the new information with established knowledge, helping to build a next-generation SE",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026).

Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Toe-brachial Index and Coronary Calcification in Type 1 and 2 Diabetes\n\n\nSummary: Diabetes is not a coronary risk equivalent, despite cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in diabetes. So, to identify diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk is necessary. Coronary artery calcification score predicts major coronary events, and improves risk reclassification in asymptomatic diabetic patients. But, cornary artery calcification score is expensive and exposes patients to radiation. So, it cannot be used for large-scale screening. It could be interesting to identify the predictive factors of coronary artery calcification score.",

He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Optimal Blood Pressure for the prevenTIon of Major vAscuLar Events in Patients With DIABETES Mellitus (OPTIMAL-DIABETES)\n\n\nSummary: High blood pressure (BP) is a major public health concern, especially in low and middle income countries. High BP is a highly prevalent condition, and it is usually associated with diabetes mellitus. Both high BP and diabetes are risk factors for major cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina and heart failure. In addition, high BP is also related to cognitive decline. The OPTIMAL-DIABETES trial consists of a two-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) target will reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in diabetic patients compared to the standard SBP target.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP) between 130 and 180 mm Hg:\n130 to 150 mm Hg (if on 0-4 medications)\n130 to 160 mm Hg (if on 0-3 medications)\n130 to 170 mm Hg (if on 0-2 medications)\n130 to 180 mm Hg (if on 0-1 medications)\nType 2 diabetes\nTo be considered as having a high cardiovascular risk, including AT LEAST ONE of the following factors:\nEstablished cardiovascular disease (CVD), including:\nCoronary artery disease: previous myocardial infarction, previous acute coronary syndrome, previous percutaneous intervention with coronary stent implantation, or stenosis of at least 50% in a coronary artery associated to typical angina pectoris; or\nCerebrovascular disease: previous stroke (except those events caused by intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation), or stable for at least 2 weeks preceding inclusion in the study; or\nCarotid artery disease: previous carotid endarterectomy, previous percutaneous intervention with carotid stent implantation, or stenosis of at least 50% in a carotid artery associated to intermittent claudication; or\nPeripheral artery disease: prior surg",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.~As of today a doctor can not determine which patient has a higher risk of developing these diseases.~In this PhD project we aim at identifying diabetic patients with a specific pattern in the amount of proteins in the blood, tissue and genetic material who are at high risk of death or disease related to the heart and blood vessels. We explore this problem from two angles.~In the first part of the PhD study, we identify and measure proteins, which are related to high risk of disease in the heart and blood vessels. These proteins come from the blood vessels (a specific part called the basement membrane) and are believed to be present in a higher concentration, when people have diabetes. At the same time, we measure the same proteins in a blood sample from the patients, and we also examine their genetic properties with a focus on specific genetic areas.~All the tissue and blood samples have already been collected from patients, who have undergone a by-pass operation in the Heart at Odense University Hospital since 2008. All of the tests were done in the early 1990'ies and again 15 years later.~We think that there is a connection between diabetes and the diameter of the blood vessel and that, over time, diabetes can cause the blood vessel to become narrower. This idea links the two studies because the same proteins that can be found in the first study are important in determining the risk of having a narrow blood Vessel when the patient has diabetes.~2.~This project can contribute with a deeper knowledge about the linking mechanisms between diabetes and disease in the heart and blood vessels: which proteins are present in higher concentration? How does this relate to a higher risk? How do diabetic blood vessels change over time? We will aim at answering these questions.~With regards to clinical practice, we see several perspectives:~deeper knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms behind the diasease in the heart and blood vessels that follows diabetes~development of a new blood test. Over time, the proteins measured in this study could be developed to a new blood test that gives information about a patients risk of developing a diasease in the heart or blood vessels~better treatment for patients with diabetes because aptient with high risk can be treated more intensely~In order to achieve the goals of this project there are several overall tasks:~select patients form the biobank, that are suitable for the project (the correct type of tissue and blood sample available)~do work in the laboratory. This includes cutting and preparing tissue, analyzing the tissue and blood samples, implementing new methods for analysis etc.~collect clinical data form Statistics Denmark.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the",

Patients that ultimately present to the ED have failed outpatient therapy and exhibit severe and persistent symptoms. Treatment options have been traditionally with a parenteral opiod, generally Demerol. Unfortunately, patients with chronic painful conditions like migraines have been prone to dependency. In 1986, a nonopioid, compazine was noted serendipitously to relieve migraine headache pain. 1 Nonopioid regimens have evolved as standard therapy in the treatment of migraines in the ED. Today, there are a number of nonopioid treatment options, but not without their own individual concerns. Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are effective, but commonly cause nausea and vomiting. Sumatriptan is expensive has recurrence rate, is ineffective in about 20-30%, and is contra-indicated in patients with cardiac disease. Metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, commonly used as an anti-emetic agent, has been widely studied for use with acute migraines. Its side effect profile includes drowsiness and dystonic reactions. Compazine has been successfully used to treat migraine headaches for the past several decades, and has been accepted as standard treatment of headaches in the ED. 2 Its side effect profile includes extrapyramidal effects, dysphoria, drowsiness and akathisias. The ideal medication for treating headaches would have no addictive properties, few side effects, quick onset, be highly effective and have a low rate of recurrence. Somatostatin is known to have an inhibitory effect on a number of neuropetides, which have been implicated in migraine. Native somatostatin is an unstable compound and is broken down in minutes, but octreotide, a somatostatin analogue has a longer half life. Intravenous somatostatin has been shown to be as effective as ergotamine in the acute treatment of cluster headache. 3 The analgesic effect of octreotide with headaches associated with growth hormone secreting tumor has been established. Kapicioglu et. al performed a double blind study comparing octreotide to placebo in treating migraines. They found there to be a significantly greater relief of pain with octreotide at 2 and 6 hours compared to placebo (76% vs 25%, p<0.02). They went on to note that those patients in the octreotide group had earlier relief of symptoms and no side effects. The only minor adverse event related to the administration of octreotide was a local reaction in 3 patients (18%). In a study performed recently in Netherlands, no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, routine chemistry, and urinalysis were observed with octreotide use. 4 Levy et. al also performed a",

The smallest stone is 14mm.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Causes and Natural History of Dyslipidemias\n\n\nSummary: This study will evaluate people with dyslipidemias - disorders that affect the fat content in the blood. Fats, or lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are carried in the blood in particles called lipoproteins. These particles are involved in causing blood vessel diseases that can lead to conditions like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or heart attack. Participants will undergo accepted medical tests and procedures to evaluate their condition. Most of the test results are helpful in making a diagnosis and in guiding treatment.~People with lipid disorders are eligible for this study. Representative types of patients include those with:~Plasma cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dl or less than 120 mg/dl~Plasma LDL-C levels greater than 130 mg/dl or less than 70 mg/dl~Plasma HDL-C levels greater than 70 mg/dl or less than 25 mg/dl~Unusual cholesterol deposits or xanthomas (nodules of lipid deposits on the skin)~Children under 2 years of age are excluded from the study.~Participants will undergo some or all of the following procedures:~Plasma evaluation. Apolipoproteins (plasma proteins involved in metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and proteins in the blood) and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are measured.~Fat biopsy. A small sample of fat tissue is collected for examination. For this test, an area on the buttock or abdominal wall is numbed. A needle is inserted into the fat, and a small amount of tissue is sucked out by a syringe.~Leukapheresis. White blood cells are collected to help diagnose the lipid disorder. For this test, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components, and the white cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.~Skin biopsy. Skin cells are collected for study. The cells are grown in the laboratory and the amount of cholesterol that enters or leaves the cells is measured, providing information on abnormalities in cholesterol transport. For this test, an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular area is removed, using a skin punch instrument similar to a sharp cookie cutter.~Heparin infusion study. Heparin, a blood thinner, releases enzymes that break down fat in the blood. Lipase activity (breakdown of fats) in the blood is measured following the injection of heparin into a vein.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nChildren >= 2 years of age and >12 kg and adults\nDyslipidemia subjects of interest the group\nThe following is a representative list of the types of patient presentations with dyslip",

Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra) is an FDA- approved medication used in the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at the time of orthopedic or abdominal surgery, as well as for the treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE). As with many medications, therapeutic dosages have not been fully investigated for the morbidly obese population. Our goal is to study the therapeutic blood levels, after 2 different dosages of the medication are given to morbidly obese volunteers. We will recruit 21 morbidly obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 35) individuals who are in the evaluation process for bariatric surgery. They will be divided into 7 groups: 3 participants with BMI 35 - 39.9, 3 with a BMI of 40 - 49.9, 3 with a BMI of 50 - 59.9, 3 with a weight of 100 - 149 KG, 3 with a weight of 150 - 199 KG and 3 with a weight of 200 - 249 KG. Participants will be administered two different doses of the medication with a 2-week interval in between, then blood will be drawn in various intervals throughout the next 48 hours to see which dose provides the best therapeutic levels. Participants will be monitored closely for any side effects or complications.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION\nAge 19-65 years\nBMI 35-65 Kg/m2\nPregnancy test Negative on day of study\nPast medical history\ncerebrovascular accident (including TIA within 6 months of the study)\nDiabetic retinopathy proven by fundoscopy\nHistory of inherited thrombotic/hypercoagulable defect\nHistory of heparin induced thrombocytopenia\nHistory of bacterial endocarditis\nKnown hypersensitivity to fondaparinux\nUlcerative colitis\nHistory of GI bleeding\nHistory of hematuria\nRecent surgery (last 3 months)\nRecent trauma (last 3 months)\nLaboratory values\nPlatelet count \u2264 100,000 mm3\nHemoglobin < 12 g/dL (women), or < 14 g/dL (men)\nProthrombin time > 13 sec\nPTT > 35 sec\nALT 3xULN and bilirubin 1.5xULN (>35% direct); or ALT 5xULN; or ALT 3xULN if associated with the",

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\n```Here is an example patient note:\nPatient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Identifying Responders to Xolair (Omalizumab) Using Eosinophilic Esophagitis as a Disease Model\n\n\nSummary: Eosinophilic Esophagitis(EoE) is a condition characterized commonly by vomiting, nausea, epigastric pain, dysphagia, heartburn and food impaction among other gastrointestinal symptoms along with obstructive esophageal symptoms in both pediatric and adult population. The pathology of this disease is postulated to be allergy mediated and the incidence of this disease is seen to parallel an increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma.~Most of the current therapies for EoE are directed at decreasing esophageal allergic inflammation and mirror the treatment options for allergic asthma. Swallowed corticosteroids and elimination diets or elemental diets have shown variable efficacy is improving symptoms. However, specific pathophysiologic mechanism of EoE is still largely unknown and there is no definitive treatment that completely resolves symptoms and histological findings. Omalizumab is a recently developed anti-IgE antibody that has been shown to decrease the use of inhaled and oral corticosteroids and improve asthma related symptoms in patients with allergic asthma. In this study, Eosinophilic esophagitis is being used as a disease model to study the mechanism of action of monoclonal Anti-IgE antibody in vivo. The resolution of symptoms clinically, and histological changes (and improvements) in response to treatment with Xolair (omalizumab) in patients suffering from EoE will be determined. The primary objective of this open label, study is to determine mucosal markers that will predict responders to Omalizumab (Xolair).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria\nEstablished diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, determined by eosinophils >15/high power field in the distal esophagus and/or microabscesses.\nPatients should be on therapy either by food avoidance or swallowed steroids, with no change in the food avoidance and steroid dose during therapy.\nOne active symptom of disease (epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia or heartburn) at least 2 days of the week.\nFailed response to proton pump inhibitors or a negative ph probe test or Negative impedance study.\nMales and females between ages 12-76 years.\nExclusion criteria\nPatients with gastrointestinal reflux disease.\nEosinophilic disease in the stomach or duodenum.\nPeripheral eosinophil counts >1500 (hyper eosinophilic syndrome).\nWomen of childbearing potential not using two forms of contraception method(s) including but not limited to condoms, diaphragm, oral contraceptive pills, other hormonal methods, intrauterine device or tubal ligation and vasectomy, as well as",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year. The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Selumetinib and Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer\n\n\nSummary: This phase II trial studies how well giving selumetinib and erlotinib hydrochloride together works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that is refractory to chemotherapy. Selumetinib and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas\nPatients must have locally advanced unresectable disease not amenable to curative resection or extrapancreatic metastases; patients must have EITHER radiographically measurable disease (defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension [longest diameter to be recorded] as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography [CT] scan) AND/OR a serum CA19-9 measurement > 2 x ULN\nOne prior line of systemic therapy for advanced disease (locally advanced or metastatic)\nThe following represent acceptable examples meeting the definition of one prior line of therapy:\nGemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other agents; patients receiving (a) gemcitabine initially alone, with the eventual addition of a second agent; or (b) gemcitabine as part of a combination regimen, followed by gemcitabine alone; are eligible\nA non-gemcitabine-based regimen, including (but not limited to) leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or any combination of components therein\nTreatment as part of a clinical trial involving cytotoxic agents, small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and/or immunomodulatory agents\nFor patients with locally advanced disease, prior radiation to the primary tumor is allowable as long as there is clear evidence of disease progression (either radiographic locoregional disease progression and/or a rising CA19-9 level); patients may have received chemotherapy both concurrently and/or sequentially with (either before or after) the radiation and still be eligible for the study, as this would be considered all part of the same course of treatment\nLife expectancy of greater than 8 weeks\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/uL\nPlatelet count >= 100,000/uL\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 (except those subjects who are receiving full-dose warfarin)\nTotal bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT",
