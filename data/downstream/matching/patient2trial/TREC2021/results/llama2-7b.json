Both IHC and ISH assays will be performed; however, only one positive result is required for eligibility.\n\t+ Estrogen/progesterone receptor positive OR negative disease allowed.\n* Patients must have measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.\n* Patients that have failed at least one anti-HER2 therapy in the metastatic setting.\n* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\t+ Absolute neutrophil count \u22651,500/mL\n\t+ Platelets \u2265100,000/mL\n\t+ Total bilirubin \u2264 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\t+ Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 5 \u2264 X institutional ULN\n\t+ Creatinine \u2264 institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\t+ Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50% measured by echocardiogram (preferred) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans.\n\nNow, let's assess the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial based on the information provided in the patient note and the clinical trial description:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant.\n\nThe patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. Specifically, the patient is not a woman aged \u2265 18 years, does not have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky >60%), and does not have metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
