Five-year clinical trial outcomes and clinical experience have demonstrated durable virologic suppression in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients, including patients with extensive antiretroviral history and documented antiretroviral resistance. Studies have also exhibited low adverse effect rates and reliable long-term safety lending to improved tolerance. Several trials have evaluated the reduction in adverse effects in patients switched from various antiretroviral agents to RAL. Treatment-na\u00efve studies have demonstrated a lipid-neutral effect in patients on RAL-containing regimens. When transitioning patients from a ritonavir-boosted PI regimen, statistically significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides were demonstrated. Given its negligible interaction with the cytochrome P450 system, RAL displays minimal drug-drug interactions, making it a good option for ageing patients on multiple medications.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nHIV-1 infected patients,\naged \u2265 60 years old\nnaive patients receiving raltegravir based-regimen, including Nuc-sparing regimens,\nexperienced patients with virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA<50 copies) who had switched from any antiretroviral drug to raltegravir-based regimens (including Nuc-sparing regimens) because of toxicity, convenience or other reasons.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.</s>",

The lack of good biomarkers for active infection or clinical end-points poses a problem for assessing the performance of new drugs or therapeutic interventions. Among the biomarkers, several studies showed that Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-ProBNP) is accurate maker of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.\n\nObjective:\n\nOur long-term goal is to establish The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) as a Center of Excellence for Neglected Infectious Disease Research in Brazil. The specific aims are to begin that process by focusing on Trypanosoma cruzi infection with the goal of finding an array of biomarkers that correlate with parasite persistence and Chagas cardiac disease status that can be used to infer risk of disease progression and death as well used as markers of cure (parasite eradication) or clinical efficacy (stabilize or reverse cardiac damage) of novel drugs.\n\nMethod:\n\nThe investigators established a prospective cohort of 1,959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). The study is being conducted in 21 cities of the northern part of Minas Gerais state in Brazil, and includes a follow-up of at least two years (baseline and 24 months) . The evaluation included collection of socio-demographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviors, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas Disease (ChD), symptoms, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection, and ECG.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* To be a client of the TMS TeleHealth System\n* Have a positive history for T. cruzi infection or Chagas disease\n* Have an abnormal ECG\n* Consent to participating in the research program\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n* Any severe condition with ominous prognosis that indicates a life expectancy of less than two years\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded</s>",

He was treated with plasma exchange and corticosteroids.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Early Goal Directed Therapy Using a Physiological Holistic View. The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Study\n\nSummary: Septic shock is a highly lethal condition associated with a mortality risk of 30 to 60%. Optimizing tissue perfusion and oxygenation is the aim to decrease mortality and morbidity in septic shock patients. Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial resuscitation is particularly difficult to interpret, although optimizing systemic blood flow might reverse ongoing hypoperfusion. Nevertheless, if persistent hyperlactatemia is caused by non-hypoperfusion-related mechanisms, then sustained efforts aimed at increasing cardiac output (CO) could lead to detrimental effects of excessive fluids or inotropes. Another potential alternative resuscitation target is peripheral perfusion as assessed by capillary refill time (CRT), mottling score or central-to-toe temperature differences. Reversal of abnormal peripheral perfusion might represent improvement in tissue hypoperfusion with the advantage of a faster recovery than lactate.\n\nHypothesis: Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor load, and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.</s>",

Formation of blood clots, or venous thromboemboli (VTE) in pregnancy can have dangerous and even life-threatening effects on the mother and fetus. Enoxaparin is the preferred medicine to prevent clotting in pregnant patients who are at risk for VTE, because it has been studied to be safe and effective in pregnancy without any harms to the fetus. Although this medication is routinely used and is recommended by several prominent medical groups, the optimal dosing for prevention of VTE is still unclear. The range of standardly prescribed dosing regimens of Enoxaparin includes 40mg daily and 1mg/kg daily, but these two dosing strategies have never been compared in a head-to-head fashion.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Warrants prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in pregnancy according to American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology Practice Bulletin 2000, reaffirmed in 2008:\n\t+ History of idiopathic thrombosis\n\t+ History of thrombosis related to pregnancy or oral contraceptive use\n\t+ History of thrombosis accompanied by an underlying thrombophilia other than homozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation, heterozygous for both the factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation, or AT-III deficiency\n\t+ Without a history of thrombosis but who have an underlying thrombophilia and a strong family history of thrombosis\n* Known thrombophilia except for those listed above, with a history of adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) as defined by:\n\t+ \u2265 3 pregnancy losses in the 1st trimester\n\t+ \u2265 2 pregnancy losses/stillbirth in the 2nd trimester\n\t+ 1 pregnancy loss/intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) in the 3rd trimester\n\t+ Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n\t+ Abruptio placentae\n\t+ Severe pre-Eclampsia prior to 34 weeks gestation\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.</s>",
