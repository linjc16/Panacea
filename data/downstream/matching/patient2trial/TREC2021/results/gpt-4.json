No other malignancy within 5 years of registration: The patient note does not indicate any other malignancy.\n\n4.

Completed all planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery: The patient is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy, which implies chemotherapy has not started yet.

The inclusion criteria for the clinical trial focus solely on patients with LVEF of 40% or less, which is a measure of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\nGiven that the patient note does not provide information on the patient's LVEF or any indication of heart failure, we cannot determine whether the patient meets the trial's inclusion criteria.

To be included in the trial, the patient must meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n1. The patient must be at least 18 years of age.\n2. The patient must have a significant diameter reduction of the extracranial or intracranial internal or common carotid artery, defined as \u226550% stenosis for symptomatic patients or \u226580% stenosis for asymptomatic patients determined by carotid duplex ultrasound scan and/or carotid angiography.\n3. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.\n4. The patient and the patient's physician must agree to have the patient return for a 30-day and one-year clinical and ultrasound imaging follow-up evaluations as indicated in the protocol.\n5. Reference vessel diameter \u2265 3.5 mm - \u2264 9.0 mm diameter.\n\nConsidering the patient note, the following applies:\n\n1. The patient is 46 years old, which satisfies the age criterion.\n2. The patient has severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery, which is confirmed by ultrasonography, meeting the criterion for significant diameter reduction (the exact percentage of stenosis is not provided but \"severe stenosis\" suggests it may be \u226550% or \u226580%).\n3. The patient is male, so the pregnancy test criterion is not applicable.\n4. There is no information provided about the patient's willingness to return for follow-up evaluations, but this is typically confirmed at the time of consent.\n5. There is no information provided on the reference vessel diameter.\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient seems to meet the age and stenosis criteria. However, there is insufficient information to determine if the stenosis meets the \u226550% for symptomatic or \u226580% for asymptomatic patients required by the trial, and there is also no information provided on the reference vessel diameter. Additionally, we do not have explicit confirmation of the patient's willingness to return for follow-up evaluations.\n\nDue to these gaps in information, particularly regarding the severity of the stenosis in terms of percentage required by the trial criteria and the lack of information on the reference vessel diameter and agreement for follow-up, the patient cannot be confirmed as eligible.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant.",
