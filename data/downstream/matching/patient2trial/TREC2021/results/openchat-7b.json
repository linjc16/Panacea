It is not yet known whether sorafenib is more effective than a placebo when given together with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane in treating metastatic breast cancer.\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works compared with a placebo when given together with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane in treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nInclusion criteria: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast\nMetastatic disease\nMeasurable disease, defined as \u2265 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion \u2265 20 mm by conventional techniques (i.e., MRI or CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis) or \u2265 10 mm by spiral CT scan\nNon-measurable disease allowed, defined as all other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm by conventional techniques or < 10 mm by spiral CT scan)\nMust have objective evidence of progression within the past 3 months\nNo human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu overexpression, defined as gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization or 3+ overexpression by immunohistochemistry, or unknown HER2/neu status\nNo active brain metastases\nPatients with neurological symptoms must undergo a contrast CT scan or MRI of the brain to exclude active brain metastasis\nPatients with treated brain metastases allowed provided they have no evidence of disease and have been off definitive therapy (including steroids) for the past 3 months\nHormone receptor status:\nEstrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease\nPATIENT CHARACTACTERISTICS:\nFemale\nThe Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\nPostmenopausal\nHemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL\nANC \u2265 1,500/mm\u00b3\nPlatelet count \u2265 100,000/mm\u00b3\nTotal bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\nALT and AST \u2264 2.5 times ULN (\u2264 5 times ULN for patients with liver involvement)\nINR \u2264 1.5\nPTT within normal limits\nCreatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN\nNot nursing, pregnant, or able to become pregnant\nNo significant traumatic injury within the past 4 weeks\nNo history of bleeding diathesis or uncontrolled coagulopathy\nNo serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\nNo clinically significant cardiac disease, including any of the following:\nNew York Heart Association class III-IV congestive heart failure\nUnstable angina (i.e., anginal symptoms at rest) or new",

He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/dL and 54.5\u2009cm/dL, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/dL and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/dL. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.\n\nHere is the clinical trial:\nTitle: QUILT-2.008: Study of ALT-801 With Cisplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma\n\nSummary: This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study of ALT-801 combined with cisplatin. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, determine the Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD), and characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ALT-801 given with cisplatin in patients who are chemotherapy na\u00efve and have metastatic melanoma that is considered surgically incurable.

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\n\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Identifying Responders to Xolair (Omalizumab) Using Eosinophilic Esophagitis as a Disease Model\n\n\nSummary: Eosinophilic Esophagitis(EoE) is a condition characterized commonly by vomiting, nausea, epigastric pain, dysphagia, heartburn and food impaction among other gastrointestinal symptoms along with obstructive esophageal symptoms in both pediatric and adult population. The pathology of this disease is postulated to be allergy mediated and the incidence of this disease is seen to parallel an increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma.~Most of the current therapies for EoE are directed at decreasing esophageal allergic inflammation and mirror the treatment options for allergic asthma. Swallowed corticosteroids and elimination diets or elemental diks have shown variable efficacy is improving symptoms. However, specific pathophysiologic mechanism of EoE is still largely unknown and there is no definitive treatment that completely resolves symptoms and histological findings. Omalizumab is a recently developed anti-IgE antibody that has been shown to decrease the use of inhaled and oral corticosteroids and improve asthma related symptoms in patients with allergic asthma. In this study, Eosinophilic esophagitis is being used as a disease model to study the mechanism of action of monoclonal Anti-IgE antibody in vivo. The resolution of symptoms clinically, and histological changes (and improvements) in response to treatment with Xolair (omalizumab) in patients suffering from EoE will be determined. The primary objective of this open label, study is to determine mucosal markers that will predict responders to Omalizuma (Xolair).\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria\nEstablished diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, determined by eosinophils >15/high power field in the distal esophagus and/or microabscesses.\nPatients should be on therapy either by food avoidance or swallowed steroids, with no change in the food avoidance and steroid dose during therapy.\nOne active symptom of disease (epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia or heartburn) at least 2 days of the week.\nFailed response to proton pump inhibitors or a negative ph probe test or Negative impedance study.\nMales and females between ages 17-76 years.\nExclusion criteria\nPatients with gastrointestinal reflux disease.\nEosinophilic disease in the stomach or duodenum.\nPeripheral eosinophil counts >1500 (hyper eosinophilic syndrome).\nWomen of childbearing potential not using two forms of contraception method(s) including but not limited to condoms, diaphragm, oral contraceptive pills, other hormonal methods, intrauterine device or tubal ligation and vasectomy, as well as women who are breastfeeding\nKnown sensitivity to study drug(s) or class of study drug(s).\nPatients with severe medical condition(s) that in people the view of",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.\nPatients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.\nThe primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nThe secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department",

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\n\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Ibrutinib lead-in Followed by Venetoclax Plus Ibrutinib in Patients With RR CLL\n\n\nSummary: Venetocinib and ibrutinib have complementary activity in clearing the disease across anatomical compartments. By combining ibrutinib with venetoclax, cells can be mobilized from tissues into the bloodstream by ibrutinib and killed in the blood by venetoclax. Consistently, the venetoclax-ibrutinib combination can achieve undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD-neg) in a sizable proportion of patients. Gentle debulking obtained with a lead-in phase of ibrutinib monotherapy may allow starting venetoclax when the disease has been reshaped in a size that fits for low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a rare adverse event (AE) of venetoclax. MRD-guided treatment duration may allow patients achieving a negative status to gain drug-free intervals and less medicalization, and may avoid all the potential, and not yet completely known implications of continuous therapy on long-term safety, drug interactions, quality of life, compliance to treatment, and economic sustainability.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nWritten informed consent according to Swiss law and ICH/GCP regulations before registration and prior to any trial specific procedures\nCytologically and immunophenotypically confirmed relapsed/refractory CLL (irrespective of the 17p deletion and/or TPTP53 mutation status and the duration of remission from last prior therapy)\nPatients in need of systemic treatment as defined by international workshop on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (iwCLL) criteria (at least one of the following indications must be fulfilled):\nEvidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

He is on IFN, RBV and direct antiviral drugs for the past 6 months. The patient takes no other medications. His medical records show previous positive HCV RNA tests and a positive enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV-antibodies. The recent biopsy was negative for hepatocellular carcinoma and was only remarkable for chronic inflammation compatible with a chronic viral hepatitis. There is no evidence of alcoholic liver disease, bleeding from esophageal varices, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, or metabolic liver disease. He is an alert male with no acute distress. His BP: 130/75, HR: 90/min and BMI: 27. His abdomen is soft with no ascites or tenderness. The lower extremities are normal with no edema.\n\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Phase I Trial of Silymarin for Chronic Liver Diseases\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of different dosages of silymarin on subjects with Hepatitis C or Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.\nInclusion criteria\nSubjects will be eligible for enrollment in this study if they meet the following criteria:\nMales or females; age at least 18 years at screening\nAbnormal ALT > 65 IU/L (ie, approximately 1.5 x upper limit of normal)\nNegative urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of silymarin. Females of childbearing potential must be using two reliable forms of effective contraception during the study (while on drug and during follow-up)\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) patients\nPrevious treatment with any interferon-based therapy without sustained virological response.\nSerum HCV RNA above quantifiable level of detection by the assay, within 1 year of screening and after the end of therapy\nNo antiviral therapy for at least 6 months prior to screening visit\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients:\nLiver biopsy compatible with NAFLD within 3 years of screening\nAbsence of other liver diseases by serological screening (anti-HCV, HBsAg), historical serological data from within 3 years of screening is acceptable.\nBefore entering the study, subjects must agree not to consume alcohol for 48 hours prior to PK sampling days or while on drug and during follow-up.\nExclusion criteria\nSubjects with any of the following will not be eligible for participation:\nUse of silymarin or other milk thistle preparations within 30 days of screening\nUse of other antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, within 30 days of screening. A multivest at standard doses will be allowed.\nAllergy/sensitivity to milk thistle or its preparations\nUse of silymarin or other antioxidants (as above) during the screening period.\nUse of warfarin, metronolozole or chronic use of acetaminophen greater than two gram per day\nPrevious liver biopsy that demonstrated presence of cirrhosis\nPrevious liver biopsy that demonstrated greater than or equal to 15% steatosis or evidence of steatohepatitis for HCV cohort\nPositive test for anti-HHV or HBsAg within 3 years of screening\nPositive urine drug screen for drugs of abuse at screening\nAlcohol consumption of more than one drink or equivalent (>12 grams) per day. Patients who consumed more than this in the past must have maintained a level 12 grams or less per day of alcohol consumption for at least six months prior to screening.\nHistory of other chronic liver disease, including metabolic diseases, documented by appropriate test(s)\nWomen with ongoing pregnancy or breast-feeding, or contemplating pregnancy\nPlatelet count <130,000 cells/mm3.\nSerum creatinine level >1.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening, or CrCl 60 cc/min, or currently on dialysis.

        "output": "```\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 55-year-old man diagnosed with HCV 2 years ago and the recent coinfection with HBV. His past medical history is non-significant. He is on IFN, RBV and direct antiviral drugs for the past 6 months. The patient takes no other medications. His medical records show previous positive HCV RNA tests and a positive enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV-antibodies. The recent biopsy was negative for hepatocellular carcinoma and was only remarkable for chronic inflammation compatible with a chronic viral hepatitis. There is no evidence of alcoholic liver disease, bleeding from esophageal varices, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, or metabolic liver disease. He is an alert male with no acute distress. His BP: 130/75, HR: 90/min and BMI: 27. His abdomen is soft with no ascites or tenderness. The lower extremities are normal with no edema.\n\nHere is the clinical trial: \nTitle: THISTLE - The HIV-HCV Silibinin Trial\n\n\nSummary: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated number of 180 million infected patients. Until 2012 the current standard of care (SOC) treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C was a 24 to 72 weeks therapy with pegylated interferon- and ribavirin (PR). In 2012, the protease-inhibitors (PI's) telaprevir and boceprevir as first directly acting HCV drugs have been approved by the local Swiss authority for hepatitis C mono-infected and HCV-HIV-co-infected individuals. However, therapy success is strongly limited in null-responders (NR) to previous PR. Treatment of HCV-HIV co-infected individuals with the new PI's is accompanied by additional challenges (e.g. drug-drug interactions, toxicity, high pill burden). Patients with advanced fibrosis are at highest risk for decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prompt initiation of treatment is strongly recommended. Recently, data in mono-infected patients showed, that in prior non responders a 12 week course of a triple therapy (TT) with telaprevir and PR followed by another 24 weeks of PR resulted in an sustained virologic response (SVR) of only 29%. In HCV-HIV co-infected non-responders with unfavourable preconditions (e.g. HCV-genotype 1, interleukin 28 B non-CC genotype, advanced liver fibrosis, high baseline HCV viral load) SVR after TT is even expected to be lower. These patients urgently need additional therapeutic options with the goal to eradicate HCV in order to prevent further fibrosis progression and to reduce morbidity and mortality. A promising substance in the field of drugs targeting the HCV replication is silibinin. Silibinin is the main component of silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle Silybum marianum. Intravenous silibinin (iSIL) targets multiple steps in the virus life cycle and exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-vir\n```",

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.\nHere is an example clinical trial:\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\nInterventions: Clinical tests\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.\nPatients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.\nThe primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).\nThe secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1.5 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 25-year-old man with type",

Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.5\nExample trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n```\n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 25-year-old man with type 1",
