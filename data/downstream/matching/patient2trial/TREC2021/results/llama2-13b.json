The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: The Role of Ursodeoxycholic Acid in Treatment of Gallstones in Hemolytic Disorders\n\nSummary: It is well established that hemolytic diseases predispose patients to the development of pigment gallstones. Gallstones are noted in at least 5% of children under the age of 10 years, increasing to 40-50% in the second to fifth decades. The co-inheritance of Gilbert's syndrome increases the risk of cholelithiasis four to five-fold. In patients with chronic hemolysis, total bile lipid concentration is decreased and the total bilirubin to total lipid ratio is increased. This suggests that the conjugating capacity of hepatocytes is surpassed by the excessive amount of bilirubin resulting from hemolysis. Increased bilirubin monoconjugate and unconjugated bilirubin can precipitate in bile and form complexes with inorganic ions, mostly calcium, and develop into stones.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of a hemolytic disorder including spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency, thalassemia or sickle cell disease.\n* Patients with cholelithiasis or bile sludge.\n* Age greater than or equal to 4 years.\n* Ability to consent to and participate in the study and follow study procedures.\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge, and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Inhaled Steroids for Acute Pharyngitis.\n\nSummary: Background: Acute pharyngitis (AP) is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Most AP patients' who present to the ED are interested in relief their sore throat (pain). There are different approaches available in the literature to control AP pain. Studies have shown that the use of systemic glucocorticoids significantly decreases patients' sore throat. Up to our knowledge, there are no available trials looking at the role of nebulized glucocorticoids in treating infective AP.\n\nAim: Our aim is to investigate in pediatrics and adults population \u22655 years presenting to ED with AP if the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids as an adjunct to standard AP treatment, compared with placebo leads to complete resolution or improvement in symptoms.\n\nMethod: The investigators are planning to conduct a multi-center, double-blind randomized control trial. There will be three arms; first arm: nebulized Budesonide, second arm: nebulized Dexamethasone, and third arm: placebo nebulized Normal Saline (NS). The patients will be followed up for 7 days through phone calls to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. Our primary objective is to investigate whether the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids compared with placebo leads to significant improvement or complete resolution of the sore throat within 24hrs. Our secondary objectives are to assess if a single dose of glucocorticoids will: reduce sore throat at 48 hours, reduce absence from work or school, reduce the incidence of hospital admission, and reduce the rate of re-attendance to ED.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pediatrics and adult > 5 years of age\n* Patients complain of acute sore throat likely due to infective pharyngitis/tonsillitis as judged by the treating clinician.\n* Onset of symptoms within 7 days\n* Patient or caregiver has the capacity and willingness to give consent and complete the trial paperwork, including the symptom diary.\n* Not on antibiotics for AP.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge, and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: SEMS and Gastroenterostomy\n\nSummary: More than 20% of patients with gastric cancer have at presentation a stage IV disease. Advanced adenocarcinoma of the antro-pyloric region often determines a condition of gastric outlet obstruction syndrome (GOOS), which requires a rapid resolution for the severe consequences that will occur if the obstruction is not resolved. GOOS causes malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte imbalances that are difficult to control. Laparoscopic or open gastroenterostomy has been proposed as the treatment of choice in patients with advanced unresectable distal stomach tumor presenting with symptoms of GOOS. Noticeably, laparoscopic gastroenterostomy might be difficult to be performed in a hostile abdomen because of the involvement of the root of the mesentery, infiltration of the surrounding structures, and peritoneal carcinosis. Furthermore, laparoscopic or open gastroenterostomy provides suboptimal palliation, because it is associated with postoperative complications ranging from 15% to 50% related to a delayed gastric emptying and a protract postoperative hospital stay. These results negatively affect the quality of life (QoL), and therefore, the efficacy of gastroenterostomy for palliation has been questioned. In 1997, Kaminishi et al. introduced a technique of stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy (SPGJ), which divides the lower part of the stomach and connects the jejunum to the proximal part of the stomach while maintaining a tunnel that is 2 to 3 cm in diameter along the lesser curvature. This technique theoretically provides some benefits: endoscopic evaluation of the tumor response to adjuvant chemotherapy and the possibility of repeated endoscopic local treatment on the tumor, prevention of ingested food retention in the distal part of the stomach thus facilitating gastric emptying and improving patient's QoL. A current alternative to laparoscopic or open surgical approach to an advanced gastric tumor is the positioning of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) which offers many potential advantages: the avoidance of general anaesthesia for a laparoscopic or open approach, a shorter hospital stay, and a minor patient postoperative discomfort.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria are age less than 85 years, pre-treatment histological diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, computed tomographic (CT), adjuvant-neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen, symptoms of GOOS (symptoms of GOOS include: regular, frequent feeling of bloating or fullness; feeling full after eating less food; nausea and vomiting of undigested food, especially right after eating, abdominal pain) lumen reduction ranging between 70% and 99% at gastroscopy.\n\nCriteria for exclusion are a white blood cells count less than 4,000/L, a plate",

Cirrhosis and HCC are the most serious complications of chronic HCV infection. Some studies noted that the risk of HCC increased 17-fold among HCV-infected patients compared with anti-HCV negative controls. Many studies demonstrate that direct antiviral therapy seems to accelerate the development of HCC, soon after the end of treatment, in those patients at higher risk of HCC occurrence or recurrence; and preliminary reports seem to indicate that HCC developed after direct antiviral therapy has more aggressive features. These findings clearly indicate the need for aggressive and close monitoring of cirrhotic patients during and after antiviral treatment, to detect and treat HCC at their earliest occurrence. Genetic variation plays a key role in HCC susceptibility and development of the disease. Genotype distribution frequency data can be used to map single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity in a population and to examine the risk and development of specific diseases. Many reports indicate an association between SNPs in certain genes and the susceptibility and clinicopathological status of HCC. MMP-1 is an endogenous peptide enzyme that is most widely expressed in interstitial collagenase, which can degrade the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells. It is involved in many stages of tumorigenesis, in angiogenesis, and in suppression of tumor cell apoptosis. The association between the MMP-1 - 1607 1G/2G polymorphism and the emergence of several diseases including the risk for many cancers has been reported. There are results suggest that MMP-1 is overexpressed in a large proportion of patients with HCC which correlated with the disease progression and poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, MMP-1 high expression proved to be a risk factor for tumor recurrence and independent molecular marker of prognosis in HCC and may become a novel target in the strategies for the prediction of tumor progression and prognosis of this disease.\n\nAim: To assess the contribution of MMP-1-1607 genotype polymorphism to the risk of HCC on top of HCV.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nThe control population comprised 20 healthy individuals with no liver infection. Patients will be subjected to a full history and thorough physical examination. The liver will be examined in all patients by local physical examination to detect possible abnormalities. The diagnosis of HCC cases include a combination of history, clinical examination, radiological examination including ultrasound and triphasic computed tomography, Child-Pugh classification, and laboratory investigations including hepatitis C marker.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

It is one of the main modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In France, 50% of treated hypertensives are uncontrolled and only 30% of treated patients are fully adherent to their antihypertensive treatment. Poor adherence to drug treatments is considered as one of the main causes of non-control of hypertension. Since 2018, a new profession has entered the French healthcare system: Advanced Practice Nurses (APN). They have many broad skills, at the interface of nursing and medical exercises. The purpose of this interventional study is to assess the impact of APN on blood pressure (BP) control in the context of usual care of hypertension thanks to a better adhesion of patients and a better therapeutic alliance. The hypothesis formulated is that an individual APN intervention, included in a usual hypertension management, improves BP control.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* at least 18 years of age,\n* treated or untreated hypertension,\n* can to provide a written informed consent.\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\nBased on the patient note, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial because they have type 1 diabetes and cardiomyopathy, which are not included in the trial's inclusion criteria.

Because the Taxol formulation of paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor, an organic solvent containing castor oil, and ethanol, prolonged intravenous administration times are required; and because the solvent has caused hypersensitivity reactions, a premedication schedule is required. ABI-007 is a new anticancer medication containing the same active ingredient as Taxol, paclitaxel, but formulated as a protein-stabilized material that is suspended in salt water and administered intravenously. The time of administration is reduced, the dose of paclitaxel can be higher than is safe for Taxol, and there is no premedication required.~This study will determine the efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel, as compared to Taxol, for patients with metastatic breast cancer.~This is an open label comparative study, so patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the Taxol or ABI-007 forms of paclitaxel, but will know what medication they are receiving. Treatment will be repeated every three weeks unless adverse events or treatment failure require discontinuing study medication.\n\nInclusion criteria: Patients will be eligible for this trial if:\n\n* Female, non-pregnant, non-lactating, and, if of child-bearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test, and use approved contraception\n* Sixteen years of age or older\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer (stage III or IV) with evidence of inoperable local recurrence or metastasis, with measurable disease\n* If patient has received taxane therapy as an adjuvant, he/she has not relapsed within one year of completing adjuvant taxane\n* No other malignancy present within the past 5 years, except non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or in-situ cervical cancer\n* Suitable candidate for paclitaxel therapy\n* Hematology levels at baseline of: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1500 cells/mm3; platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin of at least 9 g/dL\n* Chemistry levels at baseline of: AST and ALT of less than or equal to 2.5 x the upper limit of normal, if no evidence of liver metastasis; total bilirubin of less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL; creatinine of less than or equal to 2 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase of less than or equal to 5 x the upper limit of normal, unless there is bone metastasis but not liver metastasis\n* Expected survival of at least 12 weeks\n* Patient or his/her representative has signed an informed consent form\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

Children will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to one of two groups. One group will take glutamine and one group will take a placebo (a protein mixture that looks like glutamine but may not have the same effect in the body). No one will know which group is taking which supplement until the study has been completed.

Her BMI was 24, but she has gained 5 kg in the past few weeks. She gets tired more frequently and does not have energy to go dancing with her friends.

She does not smoke and she is not sexually active.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Interdisciplinary Pressure Management & Mobility Program as an Alternative to Usual Care: A Pilot Study\n\nSummary: People with spinal cord injuries posses many factors that increase their risk of developing pressure ulcers. Not surprisingly, approximately 82% of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) will experience a pressure ulcer at sometime during their life. Earlier guidelines for the assessment and treatment of pressure ulcers produced by RNAO in 20027 recommended that a client who has a pressure ulcer on a seating surface should avoid sitting. Unfortunately, this recommendation has fueled the long standing view that people with pressure ulcers should stop using their wheelchairs and return to bed. The strength of evidence assigned for this recommendation was Level=C reflecting the paucity of research evidence to support this common practice. Not only do the benefits of bed rest on healing remain to be demonstrated, there is mounting evidence that bed rest can be harmful to a person's overall health and well being. Bed rest has been shown to be strongly associated with complications in most body systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, and genital-urinary. Psychosocial complications and cognitive impacts are also well documented. Without evidence to dispel the myth that bed rest is best it will be difficult to change practice and avoid many of the secondary complications. This study is a pilot study to 1) determine whether pressure ulcers heal faster in individuals with SCI who receive an individualized community-based, pressure management and mobility program compared to a similar group assigned to usual care (bed rest), 2) determine the strength of the association between the intervention (pressure/mobility or bedrest) and wound healing, motor performance/independence and quality of life while adjusting for motivation to regain independence, degree of caregiver burden, and compliance with the intervention, 3) determine whether individuals with SCI who participate in a pressure/mobility management program experience fewer secondary complications than those who do not participate, 4) determine the cost-effectiveness of providing a time-efficient, pressure management and mobility program compared to bed rest.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Adults (18-80 yrs) with a spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia\n* Stage II-IV pressure ulcer located anywhere on the body that is likely to heal over the 6 month study period.\n* Requires a wheelchair for locomotion\n* Able to travel to local wound centre to undergo detailed wound and medical assessment that includes blood analysis and wound culture.\n* Provides consent to access relevant medical records.\n* Able to adhere with study protocol, pressure management and mobility program, wound care protocol, and evaluation procedures for 8 month study period.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

Her BMI was 24, but she has gained 5 kg in the past few weeks. She gets tired more frequently and does not have energy to go dancing with her friends. Her lab results were remarkable for high TSH levels (15 mU/L) and low free T4 levels (0.18 ng/dl). Her anti-TPO levels were extremely high (136 IU/ml). She was diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. She does not smoke and she is not sexually active.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: The ACT-OUT Trial: ACTivity OUTcomes Based on High Carbohydrate or High Fat Diet in Metabolic Syndrome\n\nSummary: Current obesity prevention emphasizes caloric restriction and avoidance of high fat foods. The result is an approach that replaces dietary fat with carbohydrates. There has, however, since been an obesity epidemic with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type II diabetes. Negative results from trials of low fat diets for weight loss, prevention of heart disease and malignancies are consistent with the inadequacy of low fat/high carbohydrate approach. One of the findings of trials comparing low fat, calorie reduced diets to ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets is that subjects randomized to a low carbohydrate intake lose more weight despite equivalent intake. This equates to a 200 kcal/day greater weight loss on a carbohydrate restricted diet. Some investigators have speculated the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restriction is due to increased energetic costs of gluconeogenesis. Alternatively, carbohydrate restriction is associated with increases in spontaneous physical activity.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* presence of metabolic syndrome by International Diabetes Foundation criteria\n* referral to metabolic syndrome program at St. Paul's Hospital\n* age > 19 years\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\n2) Eligible.</s>",

GnRH travels through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people, however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how it affects puberty and fertility.\n\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Males or females who are >= 14 years old with clinical findings of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) as follows:\n\t+ Failure to go through a normal, age-appropriate, spontaneous puberty and low sex steroid levels in the setting of low/normal gonadotropins; OR\n\t+ Normal puberty with subsequent development of low gonadotropin levels.\n* A patient under the age of 14 years may be considered for baseline evaluation if there is sufficient evidence suggestive of HH, including, but not limited to any two of the following: anosmia, history of cryptorchidism or microphallus.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients who have additional pituitary deficiencies, effectively ruling out isolated GnRH deficiency, whether these deficiencies are congenital or acquired (e.g. secondary to malignancy, infection, or irradiation).\n* Patients who are taking medications known to cause HH, such as corticosteroids or continuous opiate administration.\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient is eligible for the clinical trial.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

Body weight and shape dissatisfaction is linked to the development, maintenance and relapse of AN. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal cortex is involved in body image perception and less activated in patients with AN compared with healthy subjects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to modulate cortical excitability, and particularly to increase excitability with high-frequency rTMS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of excitatory high-frequency rTMS over the hypoactive inferior parietal cortex of 54 patients with AN.\n\nBased on the patient note, the patient is a 16-year-old girl with Hashimoto disease, which is an autoimmune thyroiditis.

Her BMI was 24, but she has gained 5 kg in the past few weeks. She gets tired more frequently and does not have energy to go dancing with her friends. Her lab results were remarkable for high TSH levels (15 mU/L) and low free T4 levels (0.18 ng/dl). Her anti-TPO levels were extremely high (136 IU/ml). She was diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. She does not smoke and she is not sexually active.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Ekvasis of Atorvastatin (Antorcin\u00ae) Treatment in Patients With Acute Cardiovascular Events\n\nSummary: In western societies hypercholesterolemia is one of the major and independent factors that predispose to cardiovascular disease and death from them. According to the clinical study ATTICA, conducted during the years 2001-2002, in which randomized 1514 men and 1528 women, rates of hypercholesterolemia observed in a sample of urban population was 39% for men and 37% women . The prevalence in the corresponding U.S. epidemiological study NIANES was 52% for men and 49% women. The relationship between cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be quite clear in the secondary prevention trials, the 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), CARE (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events) and LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) which showed the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease. Despite these remarkable results, studies were secondary prevention as a major shortcoming, the lack of patients with acute coronary events. This gap came to cover the study MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering). In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in 3,086 patients (atorvastatin n = 1.538, placebo n = 1.548), acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction without Q-wave or unstable angina). Treatment was initiated during the acute phase after hospital admission and lasted for a period of 16 weeks. Treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg / day increased the latency of the combined primary endpoint, defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia requiring admission to hospital, indicating a risk reduction of 16% (p = 0,048). This was mainly due to a 26% reduction in re-hospitalization for angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia. The other secondary endpoints were not statistically significant by themselves (total: placebo: 22.2%, Atorvastatin: 22.4%).\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Outpatients (External Ambulatory) Patients.\n* Male or female patients.\n* 18 to 99 years.\n* Patients with Hypercholesterolemia.\n* Patients with and without treatment with statin.\n* Patients enrolled in any of the study sites with acute cardiovascular event.\n* Patients discharged with study medication (Antorcin \u00ae).\n* Patients who have agreed and signed the consent form for the recording and processing of their personal data.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

This condition is detected consistently since the late 1970s in France, which has led to early care and a significant improvement in prognosis and intellectual stature of these children. However, neurodevelopmental disorders persist in 10-15% of cases. More associated diseases have been reported in approximately 10% of cases. These observations are in most cases poorly understood. The family nature of the CH is now well recognized, and a dozen genes involved have been identified up to now. However, in the majority of cases (HC not due to a disorder of the organification of iodine), few mutations have been found in the reported number of patients (5-10%), suggesting the involvement of other genes. Some of the genes have been implicated in particular specific syndromic forms, but many pathological associations remain unexplained. Also, a more complete genetic elucidation of CH would enable a better understanding of its etiology and thus its risk of familial recurrence (frequently asked questions by parents of children with CH) and secondly the presence of associated pathologies.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient: newborn (0-27 days) or infant (28 days to 23 months), or child or adult with congenital hypothyroidism (that is to say with a TSH > 15 mU / ml at screening on filter paper and / or plasma TSH> 10 mU / ml) diagnosed in the first months of life, whatever their age, sex, weight, and size.\n* Subjects with blood levels of free thyroid hormones (FT3 and FT4) in the standards will be described as having subclinical hypothyroidism.\n* If treatment with L-thyroxine could be stopped without relapse (that is to say, always with a TSH <5 mU / ml with different controls), hypothyroidism is said to be transient, whatever the age of discontinuation of treatment.\n* No pre or neonatal goitre by palpation or ultrasound thyroid\n* Negative perchlorate test (i.e., decreased rate of iodine captation <10% at 2h injection of perchlorate) when the thyroid gland is in place\n* No self-immunity known to thyroid in children with and / or his mother (defined by antithyroperoxidase antibodies and / or antithyroglobulin)\n* Signature of free and informed consent by the patient or his legal representative\n* Affiliation or enjoying a social security system\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.</s>",

The annual incidence of HT worldwide is estimated to be 0.8 - 3.5 cases per 1000 persons. The thyroid gland is attacked by a variety of cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes. Various auto-antibodies may be present against TPO and Tg, and ADCC is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of HT. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-cells is central to thyrocyte destruction. Recent studies showed higher pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum of patients with HT, and suggested HT is associated with regulatory T-cells dysfunction, imbalance of ratio of Th1 cell and Th2 cell, overexpression of Th17 cells.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Newly diagnosed (within 1 year) Hashimoto's thyroiditis by positive serum anti-TPO antibody or anti-thyroglobulin antibody\n* Euthyroid state by serum free T4 and TSH level within normal limit\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Pregnant, planning pregnant within 1 year, or lactating women\n* Renal insufficiency, abnormal liver function test\n* Hematologic diseases: anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia\n* G6PD deficiency, porphyria cutaneous tarda\n* Allergy to 4-aminoquinoline compounds\n* Known retinopathy or visual field defect disorders\n* Already receive immunosuppression therapy\n\nTrial-level eligibility:\n\n2) Eligible.</s>",

Labor induction often begins with cervical ripening, in which various methods are used to prepare the cervix for contractions and labor. Cervical ripening is beneficial and decreases the need for cesarean section; however, it can be a lengthy process.
