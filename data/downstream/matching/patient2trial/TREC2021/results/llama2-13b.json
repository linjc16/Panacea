Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Is the Severity of Urinary Disorders Related to Falls in People With Multiple Sclerosis\n\nTarget diseases: Fall, Multiple Sclerosis, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\n\nInterventions: Clinical tests\n\nSummary: Falls are a common problem in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and can lead to severe consequences (trauma, fear of falling, reduction of social activities). Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis\n* Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment\n* Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 1 and 6.5\n\nNow, let's assess the eligibility of the patient for the clinical trial based on the inclusion criteria:\n\n1.

Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment: The patient has a history of urinary retention and is using a Foley catheter, which meets the inclusion criteria. Trial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant.\n4. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 1 and 6.5: The patient's EDSS score is not provided in the patient note, so it is not possible to determine eligibility based on this criterion.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \u2265 18 years\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis\n* Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment\n* Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 1 and 6.5\n\nNow, let's assess the eligibility of the patient for the clinical trial.

Therefore, the patient would not be eligible for the trial even if the patient had multiple sclerosis and urinary disorders, as the trial is specifically focused on the relationship between urinary disorders and falls in people with multiple sclerosis.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling.

Age: The patient is 45 years old, which is within the inclusion criteria of \u2265 18 years. Trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n2. Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis: The patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine, which is not a diagnosis of MS. Trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n3. Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment: The patient has a history of urinary retention and is using a Foley catheter, which meets the inclusion criteria. Trial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant.\n4. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 1 and 6.5: The patient's EDSS score is not provided in the patient note, so it cannot be assessed. Trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\nTherefore, the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, and the trial-level eligibility is 0) Excluded.</s>",
