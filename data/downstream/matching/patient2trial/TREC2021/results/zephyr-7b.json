Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.

IM usually develops in the face of long-term acid reflux from the stomach to the esophagus and causes the lining to change from the normal squamous type (like that of skin) to a type of lining normally seen in the small intestine and colon. A subgroup of patients with IM may, subsequently, develop histologically evident Barrett's Epithelium and a small percent of these patients may develop cancer of the esophagus. Thus, BE is considered as a pre-cancerous condition. We already have an ongoing IRB for the portion of the project involving taking biopsies and performing the antibody staining to identify patients that react with the antibody but histologically negative for BE.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nDyspeptic symptoms, upper abdominal pain, heartburn, regurgitation;\nEndoscopically - normal appearing GE junction, irregular z-line, or erosive esophagitis up to Grade 2.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible. Based on the patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings, they meet the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. The patient's dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic findings of a normal appearing GE junction, irregular z-line, or erosive esophagitis up to Grade 2 indicate that they may have intestinal metaplasia, which is the focus of this clinical trial. Therefore, they are eligible to participate in the study.</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Pylori) Infection\n\nSummary: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are mainly metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19, one of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which shows a genetic polymorphism associated with enzyme activities. The most essential role of a PPI in H. pylori eradication therapy is to make antibiotics more stable and bioavailable in the stomach by raising intragastric pH to neutral levels. Most patients who have failed in the eradication of H. pylori infection by triple therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin (AMPC) and clarithromycin (CAM) at standard doses have extensive metabolizer (EM) genotypes of CYP2C19 and/or are infected with CAM-resistant strains of H. pylori. Four-times daily dosing of a PPI could achieve complete gastric acid inhibition. Dual therapy with 4-times daily dosing of a PPI and AMPC could yield sufficient re-eradication rates in patients with EM genotype of CYP2C19. Metronidazole (MNZ)-based re-eradication therapy, such as triple PPI/AMPC/MNZ therapy, also achieved high eradication rates and has been recommended as the second line therapy in Japan. But carcinogenic actions of MNZ have been unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare the re-eradication rates of H. pylori infection by the dual high-dose PPI/AMPC therapy and triple PPI/AMPC/MNZ therapy, and to validate the efficacies of these re-eradication regimens as second line eradication therapies.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients with H. pylori infection\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, and there are no exclusion criteria that apply, so the trial-level eligibility is `2) Eligible.`</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\nThe patient meets the inclusion criteria of age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.",

Because of its mechanism of action, fulvestrant is distinct from other hormonal therapies, which therefore limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other therapies such as tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors (AIs)~In this way, patients may benefit from an extended period of endocrine treatment, which has considerable tolerability and quality-of-life advantages over cytotoxic chemotherapy.~In Belgium, fulvestrant is indicated for treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with recurrence during or after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression during anti-oestrogen treatment. However, little information is currently available on how fulvestrant is actually being used by physicians in Belgium. The optimum sequence of endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer has yet to be defined and may depend on certain patient or disease characteristics.~Fulvestrant has been granted reimbursement by the Belgian Health authorities (RIZIV/INAMI) with the recommendation to collect the real life data necessary to assess the patients' breast cancer treatment history that may influence the actual endocrine treatment sequence according to physicians current clinical practice..\n\nInclusion criteria:\nPostmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, and there are no exclusion criteria that apply, so the trial-level eligibility is `2) Eligible.`</s>",

FD is commonly described as a condition of chronic abdominal discomfort localized to the upper abdomen. Postprandial bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, belching, and early satiety are common symptoms of the FD patient. FD is defined by >12 weeks of symptoms, which need not be consecutive, within the preceding year consisting of a) persistent or recurrent dyspepsia and b) an absence of organic disease after a gastrointestinal endoscopy or x-ray series. FD is therefore considered a disorder of function because no mucosal pathology is seen in these patients, as in patients with other functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromyalgia (FM). There is a remarkable degree of overlap among these three disorders. These 3 disorders share the finding of hypersensitivity and the symptom of postprandial bloating to suggest the possibility of a common origin.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMust have FD based on the most recent Umbrella criteria of one or more of: a. bothersome postprandial fullness, b. early satiation, c. epigastric pain, d. epigastric burning\nNo evidence of organic disease (including H. pylori detected at time of endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms\nCriteria must be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before the diagnosis\nThe physical exam, routine blood tests including CBC, chemistry panel and liver tests, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 24h pH study must be normal\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, as she has a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia based on the most recent Umbrella criteria, and there is no evidence of organic disease that could explain her symptoms. Her symptoms have persisted for the required duration, and she has undergone the necessary diagnostic tests to rule out other causes of her symptoms. Therefore, she is eligible to participate in the clinical trial.</s>",

Another objective is to determine the partial response (relief of nausea and vomiting to the extent that the patient wishes to continue treatment with palonosetron) after being treated with palonosetron. Palonosetron is currently approved by the FDA to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. The investigators are testing this medication to see if it can help to relieve nausea and vomiting not associated with chemotherapy.\n\nInclusion criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nPatient must be at least 18 years old.\nPatient must have a terminal diagnosis, with estimated survival of 6 months or less.\nPatients must have nausea and/or vomiting, not relieved with 1 or more anti-nausea medications. If the patient is treated with an anti-nausea medication, a minimum of 2 hours should pass to ensure that the medication is given a chance to be effective. If there is no relief after 2 hours, then the patient may be treated with palonosetron.\nPatient's medications must be reviewed. Any medications possibly causing nausea should be stopped if possible. For example, if an opiate is suspected of causing nausea, another opiate should be substituted. However, if this is not effective, or if a medication change cannot be made, then the patient would be eligible for this study.\nPatient must be able to understand and sign informed consent\nPatients who have a bowel obstruction that will not be relieved by surgery may be enrolled. This includes patients whose obstruction is technically unresectable, or who are medically too ill to endure a surgery, or who refuse surgical intervention for any reason\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets all the inclusion criteria, so the trial-level eligibility is `2) Eligible.`</s>",

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\nThe patient's age is less than 18 years, and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score is less than 1 or greater than 6.5, which do not meet the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\nThe patient meets the inclusion criteria of age \u2265 18 years, Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, Lower urinary tract symptoms with or without treatment, Expanded Disability Status Scale score between 1 and 6.",

Inflammation has been implicated in its pathogenesis, due to innate immunity activation by free fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lactate. Free fatty acids, LPS and lactate activate innate immunity in squelettal muscle and adipose tissue via Toll-like receptor 2/4, NFkB, IRF3 (Interferon Responsive Factor 3) and cytokines secretion (TNFa, IFN g, IL1b, IL6), chemokines secretion (MCP1) and leukotrienes (LTB4). Feedback mechanisms involved in TLR signaling pathways as RLI (ribonuclease L inhibitor)/ABCE1, have never been studied in inflammation due to obesity. RLI inhibits an endoribonuclease, RNase L, which has been recently implicated in TLR signaling. The purpose of this study is to analyze the role of RLI and RNase L in TLR regulation, and its potential implication in the link between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance in adipose tissue and squeletal muscle in humans.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nAge between 50 and 65 years old\nMen/ menopausal women\nBMI <25 kg/m2 for the control group, BMI >30 kg/m2 for the obese group\nNon diabetic patients\nHOMAIR <3 for the insulin sensitive obese group\nNon smoking\nWithout any inflammatory disease\nWithout any first degrees relative with diabetes\nWithout any treatment that could interfere with insulin sensitivity\nwithout any infection\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded.\n\nThe patient's BMI is greater than 30 kg/m2, which falls outside the inclusion criteria for the control group.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\nPatient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off.

Prevention of falls is one of the priority targets of rehabilitation for PwMS and walking difficulties, which can result of different factors (motor impairment, ataxia, sensitive disorders, fatigability\u2026). Urinary incontinence has been evoked as predictive of falls. But lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are frequent in PwMS, the prevalence of LUTSs is high (32-96.8%) and increases with MS duration and severity of neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common symptom. Despite its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, the severity of LUTSs has never been studied as specific risk factor of falling. However, urinary urgency and urinary incontinence could lead to precipitation and thus could increase the risk of falling in these patients.~The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and risk of falling in PwMS.~Patients were asked about the number of falls in the past three months and in the past year, and the circumstances in which they occurred (frequency, home, outdoors, going to void, during urinary urgency, nocturia). Severity of LUTSs were assessed by the Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) Score and patient were classified as with or without urinary incontinence. Number of micturition by night were specifically asked. To take into account motor difficulties and fear of falling, other clinical evaluations were done. The impact of MS on walking was assessed by the 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS12) questionnaire, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and by clinical test with the Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). Fear of falling was assessed by a simple question and with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Questionnaire.~The primary aim was to assess the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past 3 months. The primary outcome was the importance of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with OAB USP score. The secondary outcomes were the existence of urinary incontinence, the warning time (defined as the time from the first sensation of urgency to voiding or incontinence), the importance of nocturia and the other scores of USP questionnaire (low stream and stress urinary incontinence).~The secondary aims were to look for the relationship between severity of LUTSs and occurrence of falls during the past year, and to assess the relationship between falls and the classical risk factors of falls.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting.

The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal.

Bezafibrate decreases fibrinogen levels and also the incidence of major cardiovascular events in primary prevention, but its effects in acute coronary syndrome is unknown.\n\nHypothesis: Bezafibrate effect over statin therapy reduces fibrinogen concentrations, inflammatory response and clinical events, in patients with ST segment elevation ACS and hyperfibrinogenemia.\n\nMethods: In a randomized clinical trial, controlled with conventional therapy. Patients with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEAMI) and with fibrinogen concentration >500 mg/dl at 72 h of evolution, were randomly assigned to bezafibrate 400 mg/day (group I n=50) or just conventional therapy (group II n=50). Serum fibrinogen, c reactive protein and cytokines were measured. Clinical end points were recurrence of angina or infarction, left ventricular failure, cardiovascular mortality and combined end points during hospitalization.\n\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients >18 years of age who were admitted to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit of the Cardiology Hospital, National Medical Center, Century XXI (Mexico City) and diagnosed with ST segment elevation ACS and hyperfibrinogenemia within 72 h of symptom onset\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n```\n\nIn this case, the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, so the trial-level eligibility is `2) Eligible.`</s>",
