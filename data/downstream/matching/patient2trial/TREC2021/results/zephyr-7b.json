        "output": "Here is the trial-level eligibility for the given patient note and clinical trial:\n\nPatient Note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. She meets the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial, as she has untreated clinical stage II breast cancer with a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant, which is HER2-positive and ER/PR negative with 5 positive lymph nodes. She is not pregnant and is mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the protocol. Her liver, kidney, and heart functions are within the acceptable range. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.\n\nTrial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.\n\nClinical Trial:\nTitle: Effect of Preoperative Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Stage II Breast Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial\n\nSummary:\nPatients with untreated clinical stage II breast cancer are eligible. An excisional biopsy of the primary tumor is acceptable, but without definitive local therapy or prior chemotherapy. Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are prospectively randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, leucovorin, cytoxan, granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF]) chemotherapy either before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy. Chemotherapy is given as an outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, local therapy (modified radical mastectomy, or breast segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy according to patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after last chemotherapy. For patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy, chemotherapy will begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable. Upon completion of local therapy and chemotherapy in either treatment group, all estrogen receptor positive patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and physical examination each 3 months for first 3 years, each six months for years 4 and 5, and yearly thereafter. Mammogram, bone scan, chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n- Women of any age with clinical stage II breast cancer who meet the following criteria:\n  - Patients with stage II breast cancer will include primary tumor less than or equal to 5 cm in size with axillary lymph nodes which are clinically ([N0 or N1] [T1N1, T2N0, T2N1]).\n  - Patients will be staged according to the 1986 AJCC TMM classification.\n  - Patients with bilateral breast cancer will be eligible provided at least one tumor is invasive and classified as stage I or II, and neither breast is stage III.\n  - Histologic sections of the breast tumor must be classified as an invasive primary breast neoplasm of epithelial origin.\n  - Patients must be geographically accessible for follow-up and willing to return for the follow-up at the NCI.\n  - Patients must be mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the protocol.\n  - Estrogen receptor (ER) status can include ER positive, negative, or unknown.\n  - Patients with prior cancers may be eligible as long as they have received curative therapy and have had no evidence of recurrence for greater than or equal to 10 years.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n- Advanced local disease or distant metastases (stage III or IV).\n- Previous therapy to the breast other than excisional biopsy.\n- Pregnancy.\n- Unwillingness to use birth control during chemotherapy.\n- Chronic disease such as heart, lung, liver, kidney, blood or metabolic disorders which may render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy. Specifically, liver function - SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin should be less than 1.5 x the upper limits of normal. Renal function - creatinine should be less than 1.7 and/or creatinine clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min. If there is any history of cardiac disease",
