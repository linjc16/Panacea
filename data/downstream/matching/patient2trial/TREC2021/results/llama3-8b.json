Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Effect of Preoperative Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Stage II Breast Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial\n\n\nSummary: Patients with untreated clinical stage II breast cancer are eligible. An excisional biopsy of the primary tumor is acceptable, but without definitive local therapy or prior chemotherapy. Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are prospectively randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, leucovorin, cytoxan, granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF]) chemotherapy either before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy. Chemotherapy is given as an outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, local therapy (modified radical mastectomy, or breast segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy according to patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after last chemotherapy. For patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy, chemotherapy will begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable. Upon completion of local therapy and chemotherapy in either treatment group, all estrogen receptor positive patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and physical examination each 3 months for first 3 years, each six months for years 4 and 5, and yearly thereafter. Mammogram, bone scan, chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly.\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA\nWomen of any age with clinical stage II breast cancer who met the following criteria:\nPatients with stage II breast cancer will include primary tumor less than or equal to 5 cm in size with axillary lymph nodes which are clinically ([N0 or N1] [T1N1, T2N0, T2N1]).\nPatients will be staged according to the 1986 AJCC TMM classification.\nPatients with bilateral breast cancer will be eligible provided at least one tumor is invasive and classified as stage I or II, and neither breast is stage III.\nHistologic sections of the breast tumor must be classified as an invasive primary breast neoplasm of epithelial origin.\nPatients must be geographically accessible for follow-up and willing to return for the follow-up at the NCI.\nPatients must be mentally competent to understand and give informed consent for the protocol.\nEstrogen receptor (ER) status can include ER positive, negative, or unknown.\nPatients with prior cancers may be eligible as long as they have received curative therapy and have had no evidence of recurrence for greater than or equal to 10 years.\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\nPatients will be excluded from this protocol for the following reasons:\nAdvanced local disease or distant metastases (stage III or IV).\nPrevious therapy to the breast other than excisional biopsy.\nPregnancy.\nUnwillingness to use birth control during chemotherapy.\nChronic disease such as heart, lung, liver, kidney, blood or metabolic disorders which may render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy. Specifically, liver function - SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin should be less than 1.5 x the upper limits of normal. Renal function - creatinine should be less than 1.7 and/or creatinine clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min. If there is any history of cardiac disease, patients must have a normal ejection fraction on MUGA scan and no angina.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'd be happy to help! Let's go through the patient note and the inclusion criteria of the clinical trial step by step.\n\n1.
