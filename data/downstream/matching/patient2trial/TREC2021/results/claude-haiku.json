The typical pathologic feature is dramatical dilation of affected bile ducts due to obstruction by mucin production. IPNB has a better prognosis than bile duct carcinoma, but the current proposed entity contains multiple definitions or categories, thus confused in pathology.~Although mutations of several genes on IPNBs (such as GNAS, KRAS, APC, CTNNB1, and RNF43) identified in previous studies, there is still an unification at gene expression signature.~This research trial will use whole exome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis in finding causative mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from IPNBs patients.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nClinical diagnosis of IPNBs\nECOG Performance status of 0, 1, or 2\nAdequate liver function, bilirubin < 1.5 times ULN, ALT or AST < 2.5 times ULN\nAdequate renal function: creatinine < 1.8\nMust be at least 18\n\nAssessment",

Early diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease is essential to avoid its complications that could be fatal. To date, the reference diagnostic tool is an invasive procedure: the liver biopsy. The transient elastography is a useful tool for early diagnosis of liver fibrosis. This tool is validated in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis due to C chronic hepatitis. Because it is non-invasive, fast, given immediate results; transient elastography could be repeated in alcoholic patients for liver fibrosis follow-up. In the present study, the investigators propose to realize liver biopsy and transient elastography in 300 alcoholic patients in weaning to evaluate the transient elastography accuracy in the exclusion of sever liver fibrosis (Metavir 3 and 4). The reference liver fibrosis diagnosis tool will be the liver biopsy.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients more than 18 years old; hospitalised for alcoholic weaning; with an alcoholic liver disease; with at",
