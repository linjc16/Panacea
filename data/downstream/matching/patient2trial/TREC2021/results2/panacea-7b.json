We will recruit up to fifty women (twenty-five women who carry an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and 25 non-carriers matched by age and family mutation type) with regular menstrual cycling (documented by menstrual history and premenopausal FSH level). A physical exam including exam of the breast and pelvis, a standard four view mammogram, breast MRI and PET scan will be scheduled initially during either the follicular or mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. A unilateral cranio-caudal mammogram, and bilateral MRI and PET scan will be repeated three months after entry during the phase not initially studied. A CA125 and transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography will be done in the follicular phase. Carriers and non-carriers will be compared with respect to menstrual cycle differences in: (1) two measures of mammographic density (qualitative and semiquantitative); (2) a semiquantitative measure of fibroglandular volume (MRI); (3) a semiquantitative measure of contrast enhancement (MRI); and (4) FDG uptake measured over time (PET scan). On the initial and three-month visit, all participants will undergo breast duct lavage to investigate if there are consistent menstrual cycle differences in breast ductal cytologies. Participants will be seen annually thereafter for an additional three years of follow-up. A physical exam, standard four-view mammography, breast MRI, CA 125, transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography and breast duct lavage will be done annually. Consent for a PET study will be requested if an abnormality is detected on mammography or breast MRI requiring additional clinical or radiographic follow-up.~Participants in the Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study, will complete a self-administered questionnaire and telephone interview and will complete periodic follow-up questionnaires to assess various behavioral and psychosocial endpoints.~As part of the Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study, we will recruit 25 volunteers to assist in training study investigators in performing breast duct lavage.

The premalignant changes which occur in the transformed epithelium are not well understood, however several cytologic or histologic changes have been identified which are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer, including ductal or lobular hyperplasia, hyperplasia with atypia, and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ.~The identification of cytological or histological abnormalities in breast epithelial cells is an important component of risk assessment.~Objective:~Primary objectives are:~To determine the incidence and nature of cytologic changes in ductal epithelial cells from the high-risk breast, in specimens collected by breast ductal lavage, and to determine if these cytologic findings are different from those of female normal volunteers not at increased risk for breast cancer.~To characterize by breast duct endoscopy, high risk breast ductal epithelium and architecture, and correlate these findings with the cytologic findings referenced in above bullet.~To determine what is the global gene expression pattern of high risk breast epithelial cells from the high risk breast, and does this differ from that of breast epithelial cells from female normal volunteersnot at increased risk for breast cancer. The gene expression profile will be determined by cDNA microarray and validated by RT-PCR.~Eligibility:~Eligibility for high risk individuals will include:~Women with a unilateral invasive or noninvasive (DCIS) breast cancer of epithelial origin.~Women without breast cancer, but with a Gail Index greater than 1.67 percent, or a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and race-matched general population risk.~Women known to be BRCA1/2 or other hereditary genes mutation carriers.~Women with cytologic or histologic evidence of ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or lobular carcinoma in situ.~Women may be either premenopausal or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined by the absence of menstrual periods for at least 12 months.~Postmenopausal women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy must have a serum FSH level of > 40 IU/ml, and a serum estradiol level of less than40 pg/ml to document postmenopausal status.~Eligibility for normal volunteers will include:~Women who are premenopausal or postmenopausal with a Gail model risk index less than 1.67 percent, and without a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and racematched general population risk.~Women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy must have a serum FSH level of >40 IU/ml, and a serum estradiol level of less than 40 pg/ml to document postmenopausal status.~Both breasts must be free of any suspicious areas by physical examination and, for women over 30 years of age by mammogram. There must be no history of atypical hyperplasia, invasive or in situ carcinoma.~Both groups must have acceptable white blood cell and platelet counts.~Design:~Breast ductal epithelial cells will be collected by breast ductal lavage from (a) the breast in women at increased risk for breast cancer, and (b) the breast of female normal volunteers who are not at increased risk for breast cancer.~Ductal epithelial cell specimens will be analyzed cytologically for the presence of hyperplasia, atypia, or in situ changes.~Breast duct endoscopy will be performed in breast cancer patients and in normal volunteers with cytologic atypia on ductal lavage to determine ductal architectural changes associated with increased risk for breast cancer, and to provide correlation with cytologic atypia.~The gene expression profile of normal and high-risk ductal epithelial cells will be studied by cDNA-microarray to determine changes in gene expression associated with increased risk for breast cancer.~Additional molecular profiling experiments which will be performed as lavage cells are available include DNA whole exome sequencing, Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH), proteomic tissue lysate arrays, and identification of mammary stem cells.~A total of 104 high-risk subjects and 110 normal volunteers will be studied, divided approximately evenly between premenopausal and postmenopausal women....\nInclusion criteria: INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nInclusion Criteria for Breast Cancer and High-Risk Patients:\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 74 years.\nWomen with a unilateral invasive or noninvasive (DCIS) breast cancer of epithelial origin.\nWomen without breast cancer, but with a Gail Index greater than 1.67 percent, or a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and race-matched general population risk.\nWomen known to be BRCA1/2 or other hereditary genes mutation carriers.\nWomen with cytologic or histologic evidence of ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or LCISl\nWomen may be either premenopausal or postmenopausal.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes.

She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: A Randomized Trial of Ixempra Versus Taxol in Adjuvant Therapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: This is a randomized, Phase III, open-label, multicenter study.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nFemale patients greater than or equal to18 years of age.\nHistologically confirmed invasive unilateral breast cancer (regardless of\nhistology).\nEarly-stage breast cancer, defined as:\nNode-positive disease: >0.2-mm metastasis in at least one lymph node (pN1mipN2b)OR\nNode-negative, with primary tumor >1.0 cm (T1c-T3).\nDefinitive loco-regional surgery must have been completed as specified\nbelow:\nPatients must have undergone either breast conservation surgery\n(i.e., lumpectomy) or total mastectomy.\nSurgical margins of the resected section must be histologically free of\ninvasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ.\nSurgical margins involved with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) will not\nbe considered as a positive margin; therefore, such patients will be eligible for this study without additional resection.\nPatients must have completed axillary lymph node sampling for the pathologic evaluation of axillary lymph nodes as specified below:\nSentinel node biopsy and/or either lymph node sampling procedure or axillary dissection.\nMulticentric and multifocal invasive breast cancer is eligible if loco-regional surgery has been completed as described above.\nPatients with synchronous bilateral cancers are eligible only if:\nAll cancers are of triple-negative phenotype, defined as ER-, PR-, HER2-.\nEligibility based on the highest stage grouping.\nHER2 negative tumors. HER2 negativity must be confirmed by one of the\nfollowing:\nFISH-negative (FISH ratio <2.2), or\nIHC 0-1+, or\nIHC 2-3+ AND FISH-negative (FISH ratio <2.2).\nEstrogen receptor negative (<10% staining by IHC for estrogen receptor).\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\nPatient must be <= 84 days from having completed definitive primary breast surgery (either lumpectomy or mastectomy).\nMammoSite brachytherapy radiation is acceptable if it is performed\nimmediately following surgery and prior to chemotherapy. It is recommended that chemotherapy be started no earlier than 2 weeks following the removal of the MammoSite balloon catheter.\nAdequate hematologic function, defined by:\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1500/mm3\nPlatelet count >=100,000/mm3\nHemoglobin >9 g/dL\nAdequate liver function, defined by:\nAST and ALT <=2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)\nTotal bilirubin <=1.5 x ULN (unless the patient has grade 1 bilirubin\nelevation due to Gilbert's disease or a similar syndrome involving slow\nconjugation of bilirubin).\nAdequate renal function, defined by:\nSerum creatinine <=1.5 x ULN\nComplete staging work-up <=12 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment\nwith computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen/pelvis (abdomen/pelvis preferred; abdomen accepted), and either a positron emission tomography (PET) scan or a bone scan.\nAdequate cardiac function, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction\n(LVEF) value of >50% (or normal per institutional guidelines) by MUGA scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).\nAdequate recovery from recent surgery. At least 1 week must have elapsed from the time of a minor surgery (i.e., sentinel node biopsy, port-acath (placement); at least 3 weeks must have elapsed from the time of a major surgery (i.e., lumpectomy, partial or total mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, breast reconstruction procedure).\nPatients with previous history of invasive cancers (including breast cancer)\nare eligible if definitive treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to\ninitiating current study treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.\nWomen of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to start of treatment. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must agree to inform her treating physician immediately.\nPatient must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.\nWomen of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the duration of study treatment, and for 3 months thereafter.\nAll patients must be able to understand the investigational nature of the\nstudy and give written informed consent prior to study entry.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Bevacizumab, Metronomic Chemotherapy (CM), Diet and Exercise After Preoperative Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer\n\n\nSummary: If residual breast cancer is found in the breast or lymph node tissue removed after preoperative chemotherapy, one may be at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in the future. The purpose of this research study is to determine if having additional treatment after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery with bevacizumab and metronomic chemotherapy would make a difference in reducing the participants chance of breast cancer recurrence compared to the standard of care, which is observation alone. This study will also evaluate the potential additional benefits from participating in an exercise and dietary intervention compared to the dietary intervention alone. Because no one knows which which post-neoadjuvant strategy is best, participants will be randomized to one of the study groups: 1. Diet Intervention arm, 2. Diet and Exercise Intervention Arm, 3. Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and diet intervention, 4. Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, diet and exercise intervention arm.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. HER2 positive disease is not allowed. Metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) is not allowed.\nFor patients entering the trial after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there must be the presence of residual invasive disease on pathologic review following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Residual disease is defined as a Miller-Payne response in the breast of 0-4 and/or residual carcinoma in one or more regional lymph nodes that would meet AJCC 7th edition criteria for N1 - N3 disease. The presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease. Alternatively, if Miller-Payne grading is not available, the patient will be eligible if the pathology report indicates any residual invasive carcinoma following neoadjuvant therapy.\nIf tumor is triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) and the patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, disease may be clinical stage I-III pre-operatively, per AJCC 7th edition, based on baseline evaluation by clinical examination and/or breast imaging. Patients must have the presence of residual invasive disease on pathologic review following their neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nIf tumor is triple negative and the patient did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there must be pathologic lymph node positivity and Stage IIB or greater disease after surgery. For the purposes of eligibility, lymph node positivity can refer to either axillary or intramammary lymph nodes.\nIf tumor is hormone receptor positive, disease must be clinical Stage III neoadjuvantly, per AJCC 7th edition, based on baseline evaluation by clinical examination and/or breast imaging, or pathologic Stage IIB or greater at time of definitive surgery. Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who do not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are not eligible for this protocol.\nFor patients who completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the regimen must contain an anthracycline, a taxane, or both. Patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy as part of a clinical trial are acceptable. Protocol therapy must be initiated < 180 days after last surgery for breast cancer. For triple negative patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy only, the regimen must contain both an anthracycline and a taxane. For these patients, protocol therapy must be initiated < 28 weeks after initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.\nPatients with ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer should receive adjuvant hormonal therapy\nNo prior exposure to bevacizumab or other inhibitors of angiogenesis is allowed.\nPatients must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however positive margins are acceptable if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has received radiotherapy. Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ are eligible.\nPost-mastectomy radiotherapy is suggested for all patients with a primary tumor 5cm or greater or involvement of 4 or more lymph nodes. Whole breast radiotherapy is required for patients who underwent breast conserving therapy, including lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, and excisional biopsy.\nPatients must have the presence of residual invasive disease on pathologic review following their preoperative chemotherapy. The presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease. Alternatively, if Miller-Payne grading is not available, the patient will be eligible if the pathology report indicates any residual invasive carcinoma following preoperative therapy.\nLVEF equal to or greater than institutional limits of normal after preoperative chemotherapy, as assessed by echocardiogram, within 30 days prior to registration\nECOG Performance Status 0-1 within 2 weeks of registration\n18 years of age or greater\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Tumor Specific Plasma DNA\n\n\nSummary: In 2011, there was an estimated 233,000 cases of invasive breast cancer, and 39,970 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. The vast majority of patients are diagnosed with Stage I-III resectable and potentially curable disease, and for these patients, the most pressing questions are whether adjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy are indicated, and if so, how to determine whether these treatments are working. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces relative recurrence rates by 30-50%, depending on the age of the patient and tumor characteristics. However, patients with early stage disease often do not bear measurable markers of disease such as an elevated cancer antigen 27-29 (CA27.29) or circulating tumor cells. Patients with early stage breast cancer are typically treated with adjuvant therapy based on historical evidence showing that such therapy prolongs survival in this population.~Lung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. Approximately 220,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. Unfortunately, lung cancers are often diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer, due in part to little/no effective screening for lung cancer. As with breast cancer, patients are commonly treated with chemotherapeutic agents, but treatment regimens can take several weeks to months to elicit clinically detectable anti-tumor effects. A biomarker to assess early tumor response to therapy would benefit this patient population.~The contents of dying tumor cells can be detected in the bloodstream, and this may be enhanced by the leaky vasculature of solid tumors. Protein biomarkers of tumor cell death are difficult to detect due to the complex nature of plasma and the lack of technical sensitivity. In contrast, DNA is easier to detect through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Indeed, circulating tumor DNA has been detected in plasma from patients with osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Until recently, it was impractical to develop an assay to routinely quantify circulating tumor DNA due to heterogeneity between patients and tumors. Advances in genomic technology now permit sequencing a tumor genome to identify patient-specific genomic aberrations. Major genomic alterations (i.e., insertions, amplifications, deletions, inversions, translocations) can be readily detected using PCR primers which will recognize tumor DNA but not normal DNA.~While this strategy may be generally applicable to diverse types of solid tumors, two issues are apparent in breast cancer. Firstly, the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements varies widely. Whole-genome sequencing of 15 breast tumors revealed a range of 1-231 major genomic alterations (mean= 68), where 2 tumors had 1 alteration, and 9 tumors had > 20 alterations. Single-base point mutations are more common but difficult to reliably detect using PCR. Therefore, the investigators must consider that a small subset of patients may have a limited number of genomic alterations available for this assay. Secondly, intratumoral heterogeneity may mean that some genomic alterations are not present in every tumor cell. Such heterogeneity has been inferred from FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies for many years, and is now being verified at the genomic level. The investigators must consider that only a subpopulation of tumor cells may be sensitive to cytotoxic therapy, so changes in the levels of circulating tumor DNA may only be reflected with analysis of genomic alterations specific to the sensitive cells.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nWomen or men > age 18.\nAbility to give informed consent\nArchived tumor tissue must be available for genetic analysis.\nPatients with early-stage breast cancer\nHistologic documentation of invasive breast cancer by core needle or incisional biopsy.\nThe invasive cancer must be either:\ntriple-negative with both estrogen and progesterone receptor staining present in fewer than 10% of invasive cancer cells by IHC, and HER2-negative defined as IHC 0-1+, or with a FISH ratio of <1.8 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done.\nor\n*HER2-positive with IHC 3+ or a FISH ratio of >2.2.\nClinical Stage II-III invasive breast cancer with the intent to treat with:\npretreatment mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI for staging\npretreatment axillary staging\nneoadjuvant treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapy (with or without HER2- directed therapy)\npost-chemotherapy breast MRI\nsurgical resection of the primary tumor with an axillary dissection for one or more positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\nPatients with multicentric or bilateral disease are eligible if the target lesion(s) meet the other eligibility criteria.\nNo prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy with therapeutic intent for treatment of a prior malignancy is allowed.\nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer Histologic documentation or history of invasive breast cancer by core needle or incisional biopsy, or by surgical resection.\nER/PR/HER2 status may be determined using any breast tumor specimen acquired at any point during a given patient's disease history (i.e., archived tumor).

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nThe patient is a 45-year-old postmenopausal woman with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. A core biopsy revealed a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the left upper outer quadrant. The tumor is  HER2-positive and ER/PR negative. Axillary sampling revealed 5 positive lymph nodes. CXR was remarkable for metastatic lesions. The patient is using multivitamins and iron supplements. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not sexually active and has no children. She is a candidate for tumor resection and agrees to do so prior to chemotherapy.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Ficlatuzumab and Cetuximab in Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)\n\n\nSummary: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is both oncogene and prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EGFR's functional importance in HNSCC resulted in development of the first molecularly targeted strategy, the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Given the lack of therapeutic options for patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC after failure of cetuximab, there is strong scientific interest in understanding resistance in order to identify new therapies for this population. A possible resistance mechanism to anti-EGFR therapy in HNSCC is primary or compensatory activation of alternate growth factor receptors including c-Met. The MET oncogene encodes c-Met, an RTK bound exclusively by the ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway converges with the EGFR network at both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK nodes. Laboratory data suggest the ability for reciprocal compensation between EGFR and c-Met. We hypothesize that HGF/c-Met pathway inhibition may overcome resistance to cetuximab in patients with HNSCC, such as those with clinical cetuximab resistance.~Ficlatuzumab (AV-299) is a humanized HGF-inhibitory immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody. The primary objective of this phase 1b study is to find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab in patients with recurrent/metastaticHNSCC. The dose-finding study design will follow a Narayana k-in-a-row design with k set to 2 to target a 33% rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In the dose-finding phase, a total of 8 patients will be treated if no DLTs are observed or 14 patients if at least one DLT occurs. An expansion cohort will then proceed at RP2D until 12 patients have been treated at that dose level with the combination of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab. We will evaluate biomarkers of HGF/cMet pathway activation in baseline tissue, plasma and immune cells for a preliminary relationship with clinical activity.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nEach patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:\nPatients must have histologically confirmed HNSCC, from any primary site. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, WHO Type I (keratinizing), will be included. Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary, clearly related to the head and neck, will be included.\nRecurrent/metastatic disease, fulfilling at least one of the criteria defined below:\nIncurable disease as assessed by surgical or radiation oncology\nMetastatic (M1) disease\nPersistent or progressive disease following curative-intent radiation, and not a candidate for surgical salvage due to incurability or morbidity. Patients who decline radical surgery are eligible.\nIn the dose-finding phase, patients may be cetuximab-exposed or cetuximab-na\u00efve. If the most recent line of therapy included cetuximab, a two-week washout period without cetuximab dosing is required.\nPatients must have previously received, not tolerated, or been judged clinically unsuitable for platinum-containing therapy.\nIn the dose-expansion phase, patients must be cetuximab-resistant by fulfilling at least one of the criteria defined below:\nDisease recurrence within 6 months of completing definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced disease. Radiation must have included concurrent cetuximab. Induction chemotherapy, if given, may or may not have included cetuximab.\nDisease progression during, or within 6 months, of cetuximab treatment in the recurrent/metastatic setting. Prior cetuximab exposure may have occurred in first, second and/or third line.\nIf the most recent line of therapy included cetuximab, a two-week washout period without cetuximab dosing is required.\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0-1 at time of informed consent (see Appendix B)\nAge \u2265 18 years\nPatients must consent to a research biopsy of tumor tissue at baseline, for conduct of correlative studies. Archived biopsy material may not be substituted.\nMeasurable disease per RECIST criteria, version 1.1 (see section 6)\nPatients must have the following laboratory values measured within 28 days of registration:\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1500/mm3\nPlatelet count (PLT) \u2265 100,000/mm3\nCreatinine clearance \u2265 40 ml/min as determined by 24-hour collection or estimated by the Cockraft-Gault formula:Calculated Creatinine Clearance = [(140-age) X (actual body weight in kg) X (0.85 if female)]/(72 X serum creatinine)\nSerum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper-limit of normal (ULN)\nAST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) \u2264 3 times ULN\nNo prior severe infusion reaction to cetuximab or a monoclonal antibody\nWritten informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy. Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nIf a woman of childbearing potential, documentation of negative pregnancy within 14 days prior to first dose of ficlatuzumab. Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, while on study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. All fertile female subjects (and their partners) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm).\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: QUILT-2.008: Study of ALT-801 With Cisplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma\n\n\nSummary: This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study of ALT-801 combined with cisplatin.

        "output": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe, time-critical condition in which tissue perfusion during cardiac decompensation is insufficient despite optimal medical therapy to maintain end-organ function. It is well known that the outcome is poor if CSWT is performed as a standalone treatment in patients with CS. However, it has been shown that the combination of CSWT and pharmacological therapy might reduce the extent of injury to the ischemic myocardium and improve the short-term outcome. The investigators hypothesize that this combined approach might not be just a stop-gap measure, but could also exert a long term effect.\nThe primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality and readmissions for recurrent acute heart failure at least on a monthly basis during the 5-year follow-up. The investigators assume all-cause mortality to be the most relevant endpoint for patients with CHD. This is in strong agreement with the recent guideline on heart failure published by the ESC. The investigators' analysis of the data obtained from the randomized trials in patients with symptomatic refractory angina, which underwent CSWT in addition to optimal medical therapy, demonstrate the relevance of these trial findings in predicting the risk of mortality in patients with CHD. All these trials reported significant reduction in the extent of myocardial necrosis. Moreover, all these findings were accompanied by considerable reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality.\nThe investigators expect a high drop-out rate mainly due to the fact that CHD progression may not always be obvious in the early years of the study. As the patients with CHD often report worsening of their cardiac symptoms, one might predict a drop-out rate of more than 50%. Thus, the investigators will limit their sample size estimation to the primary analysis, being an analysis with a 1-sided type-I error rate of 2.5% and statistical power of 80%. Because this analysis is planned to be performed on 4,344 patients, the investigators require a sample size of 9,260 patients to provide enough number of events for analysis.\nThe investigators will recruit the above-mentioned number of patients over a 5 year period and will follow them to evaluate the event",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Assessment of Atherosclerotic Plaque Characteristics Change by DCE-MRI With Alirocumab\n\n\nSummary: Aim 1: To determine whether therapy with Alirocumab, compared to pre-treatment, will effectively improve carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristics by reducing Ktrans and LRNC size. To achieve this goal, we will (a) enroll 30 subjects who are intolerant to high intensity statin therapy and only able to tolerate low potency statin or low weekly dose of high potency statin and have LDL-C \u226570 mg/dl; (b) initiate alirocumab at 150mg subcutaneously injection every 2 weeks; (c) perform carotid DCE-MRI scans at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months; (d) perform quantitative analysis for vascular inflammation and plaque LRNC volume and other plaque characteristics; (e) compare vascular inflammation and LRNC volume between pre- and post-alirocumab at 3, 6 and 12 months.~Aim 2: To examine associations between reductions in atherogenic lipids (LDL-C, Lp(a), non-HDL-C) and changes in atherosclerotic plaque characteristics. To achieve this goal, we will (a) perform laboratory assessments of lipids, lipoproteins and apo-lipoproteins at baseline and during the study; (b) compare lipids, lipoproteins and apo-lipoproteins levels between pre- and post-alirocumab; (c) correlate reductions in atherogenic lipids with changes atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nMen and women \u226518 years of age.\nSubjects with documented inability to consistently take or tolerate high intensity statin therapy and LDL-C \u226570 mg/dL.\nSubjects are only able or allowed to take lower potency statin or low weekly dose of high potency statin due to concern of drug-to-drug interactions or lack of tolerance (pravastatin \u2264140 mg, pitavastatin \u226414 mg, simvastatin \u2264140 mg, atorvastatin \u226470 mg, or rosuvastatin \u226470 mg, weekly) or intolerant of all statin doses and with fasting LDL-C \u2265100 mg/dL.\nSubjects must have significant carotid artery plaque with maximum wall thickness \u22652 mm on ultrasound performed within twelve months of screening.\nSubject must present with a LRNC on baseline MRI scan.\nSubjects must show an adequate image quality for MRI analysis.\nMedically stable.\nWilling to participate and sign informed consent.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Extracranial Carotid & Intracranial Arterial Stenosis in Ischemic Stroke\n\n\nSummary: The aim of the work is to; elucidate how the presence of carotid stenosis influence the pattern of stroke and also how it interact with other risk factors for stroke. Also identify predictors of intracranial stenosis and outcome in patients with carotid stenosis with or without intracranial stenosis.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nCarotid TIA (transient ischemic attack) it should, however, be focal and usually motor-sensory to implicate the carotid artery system or ischemic stroke involving carotid territory.\nAsymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis or anterior circulation stenosis discovered accidentally during investigations for further risk factors.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

IM is sometimes difficult to diagnose by routine microscopic examination (called histology). We have developed a specific antibody, a protein called immunoglobulin that specifically reacts with another partner protein, if it exists. Using this marker antibody (called mAb Das-1) that has been patented (US patent #5,888,743), we have shown that this marker can detect the abnormal changes in the distal esophagus before it is evident by histology. IM usually develops in the face of long-term acid reflux from the stomach to the esophagus and causes the lining to change from the normal squamous type (like that of skin) to a type of lining normally seen in the small intestine and colon. A subgroup of patients with IM may, subsequently, develop histologically evident Barrett's Epithelium and a small percent of these patients may develop cancer of the esophagus. Thus, BE is considered as a pre-cancerous condition. We already have an ongoing IRB for the portion of the project involving taking biopsies and performing the antibody staining to identify patients that react with the antibody but histologically negative for BE.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nDyspeptic symptoms, upper abdominal pain, heartburn, regurgitation;\nEndoscopically - normal appearing GE junction, irregular z-line, or erosive esophagitis up to Grade 2.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting. The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Study of Cells From Spinal Cavity of Patients With Low Back Pain\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study to determine if cells collected give us information about what is causing a patient pain can be detected and connected with epiduroscopy images (pictures taken with a small fiber optic scope). We want to determine if abnormal areas are the source of that pain by using a catheter to provide a brief, low intensity electrical stimulation. We also want to determine if there are cells in the epidural cavity (area surrounding the spinal cord) of patients who have low back pain with or without pain shooting down one or both legs that provide information about what is causing the pain.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nUnderstand and voluntarily sign the informed consent and HIPAA forms\nAge >18 years at the time of signing the informed consent\nScheduled for epiduroscopy assisted epidural neurolysis\nA diagnosis of low back pain with or without radiculopathy\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting. The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Cholecystectomy First vs Sequential Common Bile Duct Imaging + Cholecystectomy\n\n\nSummary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate if cholecystectomy first (studied group) versus sequential common bile duct imaging/cholecystectomy (control group) result in a decrease of hospital stay, morbidity/mortality and costs in the management of patients with a suspicion of gallstone migration.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nPatients must have a clinical diagnosis of gallstone migration, defined as right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests (increase of at least two common hepatic parameters [AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gGT and/or bilirubin], with one of them being either AST or ALT with a value at least two times higher than the norm) with a reasonable exclusion of other common differential diagnoses\nPatients will be included regardless the presence of an associated cholecystitis, defined as right upper quadrant abdominal pain, radiological signs of cholecystitis (including radiological Murphy sign and/or thickened gallbladder wall and/or free abdominal fluid around the gallbladder) and signs of infection (including fever, increased CRP or white blood cell count)\nAge \u2265 16 years\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Restrictive Fluid Therapy in Severe Preeclampsia\n\n\nSummary: Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is a multifactorial syndrome which occurs in hypertension and proteinuria in pregnant women over 20 weeks gestation. It is the leading cause of maternal complications such as pulmonary edema, which occurs in about 3% of severe preeclamptic having as one of the causes volume overload. Anesthetic procedures are frequent in this population, with replacement with crystalloid of the duct during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia for combat hypotension and hypovolemia manifested by oliguria. However, as water therapy have antagonistic effects on cardiopulmonary and renal systems is no doubt as to the benefits compared to conventional or restrictive pattern of fluid therapy on renal function. Objective: To compare the renal function of patients with severe preeclampsia who received restrictive fluid therapy during caesarean section, as well as evaluating the use of cystatin C and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a predictor of renal damage in this population. Hypothesis: Intraoperative fluid restriction did not influence renal function of patients with severe preeclampsia undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nSevere PE was defined as at least one of the following criteria: systolic pressure \u2265160 mmHg or diastolic pressure \u2265110 mmHg, severe proteinuria (>5 g/24 h), oliguria (<500 ml/24 h), cerebral or visual disturbances, pulmonary edema, epigastric pain, hepatic rupture, impaired liver function, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome and evidence of fetal compromise.\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

New studies suggest that bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre and gut bacteria are important and may differ in older people. Since CC reduces quality of life and is a major reason why elderly are admitted to hospitals and residential care, there is a need to understand how these factors change with age.~Currently, placing a pressure sensing catheter inside the large intestine (pancolonic manometry) is the gold standard way to measure how well it contracts. However this involves a camera test (colonoscopy) which is invasive with risks of bowel perforations (~80/100,000). The risk is higher with age (64-80yr: ~90/100,000\u037e 80+yrs: ~120/100,000), making it unethical for elderly.~A technique called the 3D-Transit System has been developed, involving a small ingestible capsule, containing a 'trackable' electromagnet. By tracking movements of the capsule swallowed by participants, it provides precise detailed information on the capsule progression inside the whole gut and large bowel's contractile activity in real-time. It is minimally-invasive and radiation-free, making it possible to assess elderly for the first time.~This study aims to assess how bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre intake and gut bacteria differ between young and older adults (with and without CC), to better understand why CC is more common in elderly.~It is a pilot, 4 arm, single centre, observational study involving 60 women aged 18-40 years and 70-90 years (15 non-constipated and 15 with CC for each age group). The study lasts 3 weeks, containing 2 weeks of run-in period and 1 week of study period.~The four groups participants will be asked to: swallow 2 capsules to assess their large bowel's contractile function using the 3D-transit system\u037e provide stool samples to analyses their gut bacteria\u037e and complete questionnaires to assess their gastrointestinal symptoms.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria for constipated group\nAged 18-40 or 70-90 years of age\nBarthel index \u226511 [for elderly women only]\nNo co-existing acute or chronic diseases at the time of recruitment (except hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for elderly women)\nPatients with self-reported problematic constipation\nCleveland Clinic Constipation Score \u22658\nBowel movement frequency <3 per week\nStool consistency of 1-3 on the Bristol Stool Chart\nNo evidence of organic causes of constipation\nSymptoms of constipation (unsatisfactory defaecation characterized by infrequent stool, difficult stool passage or both for at least the previous 3 months)\nInclusion criteria for non-constipated group\nHealthy women aged 18-40 or 70-90 years of age\nNo co-existing acute or chronic diseases at the time of recruitment (except hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for elderly women)\nBarthel index \u226511 [for elderly women only]\nCleveland Clinic Constipation Score <8\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",

        "output": "<|user|>\nHello. You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility. The factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\n\nThe assessment of eligibility has a three-point scale: 0) Excluded (patient meets inclusion criteria, but is excluded on the grounds of the trial's exclusion criteria); 1) Not relevant (patient does not have sufficient information to qualify for the trial); and 2) Eligible (patient meets inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria do not apply). \nYou should make a trial-level eligibility on each patient for the clinical trial, i.e., output the scale for the assessment of eligibility. \n\nHere is the patient note:\nA 54-year-old obese woman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain that started 4 days ago with nausea and vomiting. The epigastric pain radiates to the right upper quadrant, getting worse after eating fatty food. The patient experienced similar pain twice in the past year. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and 2 NVDs. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. She is an obese woman with no acute distress. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness and tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones, biliary sludge and CBD stones. The smallest stone is 14mm.Here is the clinical trial: \nTitle: Scoring System in Acute Calculous Cholecystitis\n\n\nSummary: Acute cholecystitis is a common disease in the daily practice of general surgery. There are various methods in the treatment of this disease, such as early cholecystectomy, medical treatment, six weeks later cholecystectomy and cholecystostomy. However, it is not satisfied with objective criteria that these methods are selected according to which patient groups. With this observational-prospective study, the benefit of first visit scoring on 'which of the treatment options will be most suitable for the patient' will be investigated. Thus, rare but severe complications of cholecystectomy can be prevented.\nInclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\nClinically and Radiologically diagnosed with acute cholecystitis\nbe over 18 years old\n\nLet's think step by step. \nFinally, you should always repeat Trial-level eligibility in the last line by `Trial-level eligibility: `, e.g., `Trial-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.`.\n</s> \n</s>",
