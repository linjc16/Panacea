Trastuzumab will be given through the vein every 3 weeks (or every week at the doctor's discretion). The third drug, pertuzumab, is an investigational drug. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been given in studies to over 800 people. It has been effective in treating HER2 positive breast cancer.

To evaluate whether a patient meets the inclusion criteria for a clinical trial, I would compare the relevant factors mentioned in the clinical trial, such as the type of breast cancer, stage and characteristics of the tumor, other medical conditions, and other exclusion criteria, with the patient's characteristics to provide a suggestion on the patient's eligibility for the trial. In the clinical trial mentioned provided, the patient was 45 years old and female. The patient was postmenopausal with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. Based on cytomorphological assessment and breast biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) and was HER2-positive while estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) were negative. In addition, the patient had 5 positive lymph nodes. Computed Tomography (CT) showed nodules in both lungs, which were considered to be possibly metastatic lesions. The patient was a candidate for tumor resection and chemotherapy. Based on the trial inclusion criteria, the patient's tumor was \u22645 cm and had >1 positive lymph node, meeting the first inclusion criterion. The patient met the second criterion of molecular subtype, which refers to ER/PR-negative and HER2+. Therefore, it is possible for the patient to use any type of adjuvant trastuzumab. However, the patient's tumor size was large, involving the skin, meeting the third exclusion criterion.

Next, we tagged each word using part-of-speech tagging, which assigned each word a part of speech. For this, we used the part-of-speech tagger , which is a dictionary or vocabulary that identifies individual words and phrases in a sentence and classifies them by part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and then added some custom rules such as abbreviation expansion. Then, we used dependency parsing, which parses the words into clauses and sentences. For dependency parsing, we used the SpaCy implementation of the Stanford Parser  and its Python interface. This implementation uses Python\u2019s built-in libraries to compile a finite-state parser. This parser takes the text and its grammatical structure and builds a parse tree.

Then, we can assess the trial-level eligibility as \"2) Eligible\" since the factors \"no alcohol\" and \"no smoking\" are explicitly stated in the note, and the other factors match the inclusive criteria.Finally, we look at the exclusion and inclusion criteria more carefully, and we can also tell the patient not to drink alcohol so that he or she can be sure to be included in the trial.If an element is not clear in the note or the value is unknown, it should be evaluated as \"Not relevant\" \"Not relevant\" \"Trial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant\".

This involves identifying the data entities contained in the EHR text, and capturing the corresponding data fields. These data entities are also called as \"clinical concepts\" by informatics professionals.3.For the clinical concept `olaparib doses`, we have created a data field `olaparib doses` within \"PROSTATE_RCT\", and the corresponding entities are `olaparib doses` and `on days 1 and 8`, which constitute the rows and columns of the CRF table.4.Regarding the structured data `olaparib doses of 400 mg on days 1 and 8`, the mapping is to the value `yes`. Therefore, we will fill `yes` in the CRF table of \"PROSTATE_RCT\" for the value of patient ID 1001 (note: this ID is in the row label, since this field is a single-row format, with the column label being \"olaparib doses of 400 mg on days 1 and 8\").5.For the clinical concept `ECOG 2 performance status`, we have extracted the list of patients, e.g., `patient IDs 803, 1001, 1010, 9001 ...`, and the corresponding entity values. In particular, among these patients, only patient ID 1001 contains the entity `ECOG 2 performance status`, and its entity value is `1, stable disease (SD) or better (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable (PRB))`. Since we define `ECOG Performance Status` as a multi-row format, such that the rows correspond to different patients, and the rows and columns of the CRF table should have consistent labeling (see step (2)), we will fill `1, stable disease (SD) or better (complete response (CR), partial response",

In order to determine the eligibility status of their participants, the model has to be trained by the data about the association between study criteria and the eligibility statuses. However, the training data of eligibility criteria have two issues that make the data collection about criteria and eligibility statuses a difficult and time-consuming task. First, unlike annotating studies or other medical entities such as drugs, the standardized description of criteria is not provided across multiple trial registries such as trials.gov or ISRCTN. Instead, each registry provides its own set of inclusion and exclusion criteria . So, even if medical entities such as studies, study design or outcome are annotated with standardized terminologies such as CTGO or MedDRA, the criteria that are used in those contexts are not standardized. Second, criteria items could vary greatly depending on the wording employed by the individual trials. For instance, the same drug dose could be defined in two different ways. To overcome these issues, eligibility criteria were extracted by automatically fetching the eligibility criteria for all clinical trials of a specific kind. This is implemented by fetching and cleaning trials' HTML pages.</s>",

For example, the first attribute under the second column in the table is \u2018hashimoto\u2019 which is a \u2018disorder\u2019; therefore, we use \u2018not\u2019 and \u2018true\u2019 together for the comparison. If the attribute is \u2018true\u2019, we write \u2018True\u2019 and write \u2018False\u2019 if not. Once we have compared all the attributes and if they contain at least one value that is equal to \u2018True\u2019, we write that the patient is eligible for that clinical trial in the third column. For instance, in this case, the first attribute of the second column is \u2018hashimoto\u2019, which is \u2018true\u2019 (disorder value); therefore, we write \u2018True\u2019 and perform the comparison with the second value of the inclusion criteria column. The second value of the inclusion criteria column is \u2018hashimoto\u2019; therefore, we repeat the process again. We proceed to the fifth value because we have compared all the attributes. At this point, we see some \u2018True\u2019 and \u2018False\u2019, so we write \u2018Not Relevant\u2019 because of the AND operation. Then we move to the next clinical trial and we repeat the process. For this case, we will write \u2018True\u2019, \u2018True\u2019, \u2018False\u2019, \u2018Eligible\u2019. \u2018Hashimoto\u2019 is of interest to this trial despite being a disorder.

They suggested that eligibility criteria, including age, sex, interventions, settings, and inclusion and exclusion criteria, should all be explicitly stated in full detail . Because of an inability to obtain consent, only a few subjects are included in both the intervention and control groups [2, 3]. This is not a problem that can be easily fixed. Instead, we must work to identify the best possible participants for each study to achieve the greatest benefit for the majority. The goal of including only a select group of participants is to enable future studies to demonstrate stronger effect sizes, provide more accurate results, and avoid type II errors .

This disease is most common in females, and the average age of onset is in the third and fourth decade. However, there is a report of Hashimoto disease in a 16-year-old girl (1). It is possible that some genetic disorders cause thyroid dysfunction in early childhood. On the other hand, weight gain and obesity may lead to abnormal menstrual cycles and decreased energy levels in children or adolescents regardless of the presence of thyroid dysfunction since being overweight can cause many conditions including metabolic syndromes (2-4) [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, in this case, the child is 16 years old and has no other features of metabolic disorders such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, being overweight may not be the cause of irregular menstrual cycles. The current patient is experiencing weight gain after puberty, so weight gain can be a consequence of menstruale irregularities. Moreover, there are some reports about irregular menstruation with Hashimoto disease, called hypothyroid amenorrhea (5,6) [5, 6]. In hypothyroidism condition, anestrus may occur due to altered ovarian function. This causes menstrual cycles to become so irregular as to stop entirely. Therefore, obesity, which leads to abnormal menstrual cycles, seems to be caused by Hashimoto disease and not by other reasons. Although, considering that this girl does not have any other clinical symptoms, this girl was classified as `Not relevant `.

The project ZSE-DUO will evaluate whether a combination of an expert in somatic medicine and a psychiatric/psychosomatic specialist will increase the rate of assured diagnoses in patients approaching a center of rare diseases (primary outcome), accelerate the process until a diagnosis is made, reduce the costs of diagnosing a patient, and lead to a higher satisfaction of patients and health care professionals. Furthermore, the project will evaluate whether the use of psychosomatic screening tools at registration of a patient in a center for rare diseases will help to guide the diagnostic process. Two cohorts of 682 patients each will be sequentially recruited over 9 plus 9 months: the Control group cohort (CG based on somatic expertise) and the Experimental group cohort (EG combined psychosomatic/somatic expertise Included will be persons from the age of at least 12 years presenting with symptoms and signs which are not explained by current diagnoses (as judged by the patient's primary care physician and a specialized physician at the center for rare diseases ZSE evaluating the medical records). Patients will be recruited from 11 German Centers for Rare Diseases associated with University hospitals in the cities of Aachen, Bochum, Frankfurt, Hannover, Magdeburg, Mainz, M\u00fcnster, Regensburg, T\u00fcbing",

She was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, which is a type of thyroid disease. Her thyroid gland produces less than normal amounts of thyroid hormones. In terms of real-world reports, weight gain following antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation occurs with all modern regimens. Recent real-world reports suggest that integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based ART may be associated with excess weight gain compared to other regimens. This study aims to understand the changes in energy balance that occur with changes in ART. Participants with HIV who have experienced >10% weight gain on an INSTI-based regimen will be switched to doravirine for 12 weeks and then back to an INSTI for 12 weeks, allowing for assessment of changes in metabolic parameters with drug withdrawal and reintroduction. In terms of eligibility, the patient meets the BMI requirement of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater, and she gained more than 10% of her weight in the previous two years while on her current INSTI regimen, which has continued or worsened. The patient is on an appropriate NRTI backbone, and her HIV-1 levels are less than 50 copies/mL. The patient is willing to pay any associated co-pays that are not covered by her insurance, willing to switch to doravirine, and is aged 18 years or older.

It was difficult to determine from the patient note whether the patient was a woman of childbearing potential due to lack of certainty regarding her current menstrual status. However, an intact uterus indicated that she was likely premenopausal or early menopause. She used no contraception and drank alcohol frequently. She had four children.

It was also unclear whether the patient fell into the eligibility criteria of the trial.

The clinical trial does not state the exclusion criteria directly in the clinical trial, but we found that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin are included in the exclusion criteria. This indicates that the patient must not use any NSAIDs and aspirin during the study, and since the patient is taking celecoxib, the concurrent use of other NSAIDs is not allowed. In this case, aspirin is not indicated, so it is not applicable. The use of other NSAIDs is not included in the exclusion criteria, so the patient can take other NSAIDs when using celecoxib.

The first criteria to check is the age of the patient; the minimum age for the patient is 15 years, and the patient is 23 years old, which satisfies the criteria. The second criteria to check is the informed consent; the patient did not sign any informed consent for the study, since the study recruitment is not part of this platform's features, thus we will skip the criteria. The third criteria to check is history of immunizations with meningococcal vaccines/history of immunizations with other conjugate vaccines; the patient has a history of immunizations with meningococcal vaccines, which does not fulfill the criteria since the patient has been given two doses of the vaccine and the study only accepts subjects that have been given one dose of a meningococcal vaccine at least 3 years ago since the last dose. The fourth criteria to check is a family history of immunodeficiency; the patient does not have any family history of immunodeficiency, which satisfies the criterium. However, we have three exclusion criteria to check: the previous history of meningococcal disease, previous immunization with a meningococcal vaccine, and the history of a concomitant administrated medication. According to the medical history section of the patient note, the patient had elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. In this case, elevated lactate dehydrogenase is likely associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is caused by a complement-mediated injury to the small blood vessels resulting in three classical clinical symptoms: anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. In this case, we cannot assess the patient's history of meningococcal disease because we do not have information on the patient's specific diagnosis. We can, however, conclude that the patient does not have a history of meningococcal disease. Moreover, the patient was vaccinated for meningococcal disease, and it has been completed less than one year since the last dose of a meningococcal vaccine. Finally",

Then, I examine the patient inclusion criteria.

The second patient inclusion criterion is that the patient had experienced cardiac surgery, which is not mentioned in the patient note. Next is the Risk of Acute Renal Failure (R if RIFLE score). A R if RIFLE score is a classification system that is used on the nephrology ward at the hospital to classify acute kidney injury . To calculate the R if RIFLE score, I need to look for information about the patient's urine output, blood pressure, oxygenation, and blood tests like creatinine, urea, and electrolytes to see if the patient fits into the category \"R,\" \"I,\" \"F,\" \"L,\" \"E,\" or \"N.\" However, I cannot find this information in the patient note. Therefore, I will set this criterion as \"Not relevant\" because I do not have enough information to make a final decision. Finally, I will look for the patient inclusion criteria that I have not already marked as \"excluded\" or \"not relevant yet.\" The last criterion is that the patient needs to have had atypical HUS. To determine if the patient has had atypical HUS, I need to have an electronic patient file.

For this, we need to extract the sentence where each inclusion criterion is mentioned. The first inclusion criterion is age of 18 years or older. From the input text, we can see that age of the patient is already shown. The second inclusion criterion is sepsis or septic shock upon ICU admission. In this step, we need to extract sentences that show sepsis or septic shock. The third criterion is the absence of previous diabetes in the patient. As shown in the patient note that the patient\u2019s blood glucose control is not done due to diabetic diseases, the patient doesn\u2019t have diabetes. Patient-level eligibility is determined if these three criteria are satisfied. Then `Patient-level eligibility: 2) Eligible.` is written.

There was a 60 years old patient, and in a clinical trial the age range was 18 to 54 years old range. Then, the answer for that patient was not trivial.

Based on the information provided, the patient was taking medication for MDD; however, the specific medication, dosages, and duration of treatment was not specified. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the patient is currently taking medication that could interact with the study drug being considered for future clinical trials. In addition, the patient has experienced a recent episode of MDD, which may affect the participant's eligibility status. For example, if the patient is considered to have recurrent depression, they would likely not be eligible for the trial as it is intended to only recruit subjects with their first episode of depression. The information in the note also does not specify how long the patient has had their medication, but according to the information provided, it appears as if they have been on their current medication for a year at least. Finally, the note states that the patient's score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 was 20. A score of 18 and above is considered indicative of a likely diagnosis of MDD, but scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 will also vary depending on how severe the patient's symptoms are, and if the patient has previously been prescribed antidepressant medication. Based on this score alone, it cannot be determined if the patient would be eligible for their current antidepressant medication.</s>",

Since the patient was 46 years old, Asian, and was female.She met the inclusion criteria mentioned above: \u201cUS resident\u201d and \u201cRead/write English\u201d.II. Second, I'll scan the exclusion criteria listed in the clinical trial. \u201cnot contemplated suicide in the past year\u201d \u201cno serious depression\u201d \u201cnot under medical supervision for other serious medical condition\u201d \u201cnot taking opioids\u201d \u201cis a resident of states in which we have licensed medical professionals\u201dI see the patient note mentioned that the patient was on anti-depressants for the past 6 months, but the symptoms were still present. Also, the patient's HAM-D score was 20, which suggests she was experiencing severe depression. However, since we don't have access to the medical history (such as the diagnosis of serious disease or the use of psychiatric drugs) at this step, I will assume the patient may or may not qualify.I have marked \u201cNot Relevant\u201d for this patient, so the algorithm automatically assigned \u201cNot Relevant\u201d to this patient.III. Third, I will check the HAM-D score threshold mentioned in the clinical trial.If the patient's HAM-D score is less than 20, then the patient is unlikely to be eligible. If it's more than 20, then the patient might be eligible. Since in this case, the patient's HAM-D score was 20, for this patient, I decided that the patient in the patient note was \u201cEligible\u201d for the trial.IV. Fourth, I will check any additional qualification criteria mentioned in the clinical trial.For instance, in the case of exclusion criteria \u201cnot taken opioids\u201d, if the patient takes opioids mentioned in the medication log, then the patient likely won't be qualified. If the patient has not taken that medication in the past, then it's not necessary to check for the specific medication.

For example, if a trial had an inclusion criteria of 15 years and older, but the patient was younger than that, the patient was ineligible. Then, once a match was found, an assessment of eligibility was made, and a factor was determined for how the patient was eligible or ineligible. For example, they could be excluded, because they were not of the right age and excluded because they had no medical history of BMI. The only thing that could not be determined by a machine was the patient's medical history, because that was written as text with no numbers.

To make such classification, we need to consider the meaning of the values in the patient note: the value of '34' indicates the age of the patient, '113 kg' indicates the patient's weight, 'BMI: 41.5' is an indication of the patient's Body Mass Index and their weight is 'obese'.

Similarly, for `Proportion of patients with 1: ((165/187)\\*(1/(1/(49/(49/4)))-1))`, the denominator is the total number of patients in that trial, so `Number of patients with 1 (NOT RELEVANT): (165/187)` is 165/187, and the numerator is the probability of passing the first stage and the second stage, so `Probability of passing first stage of eligibility criteria (inclusion criterion): (1/(2/(101/(101/19)))-1))` is (1/(2/(19/156))-1) and `Probability of passing the first stage of screening questionnaire (eligibility criteria): (93/101)` is 93/101.

The study's primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of valacyclovir in preventing CMV end-organ disease, particularly retinitis, in this patient population. The study's second objective was to assess the effect of valacyclovir on CMV viral load and to evaluate the safety of valacyclovir. The study population consisted of 108 patients aged 18\u201375 years who had HIV infection, were CMV seropositive, and had CD4+ cell counts < 100 cells/mm3. The study compared valacyclovir with acyclovir in preventing CMV end-organ disease at two different doses: 1000 mg per day and 1500 mg per day. The results of the study showed that valacyclovir was effective in preventing CMV end-organ disease in this patient population. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between the two doses. However, the drug was toxic, and the authors emphasized that the long-term use of valacyclovir may not be practical. Moreover, the study concluded that valacyclovir was less effective than acyclovir in achieving undetectable plasma viremia. Overall, the study underscored the importance of early and effective therapy for CMV infection in patients with HIV infection.</s>",

In a patient note, we can observe patient age, gender, diagnosis, and other medical history. Therefore, \"16-year-old\" and \"girl\" about demographic characteristics of the patient was included. The patient had myasthenia gravis, a class IIa. Myasthenia gravis (MG) was defined by an autoimmune disorder. The patient was treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor combined with immunosuppressant. Therefore, the patient had a \"myasthenia gravis autoimmune disorder\", and \"previous treatment included\". On the other hand, the trial-level requirements were provided by specific information of the clinical trial. After carefully comparing the patient note with the clinical trial requirements, it was determined that the patient and the clinical trial were \"eligible.\" In conclusion, although the patient was suitable for the clinical trial in many ways, it was not suitable for the trial because the \"patient with MDS, MPN or CML\" condition in the clinical trial requirements was not compatible with \"MG\" in the patient.

        "output": "Factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Trial-level eligibility is based on the inclusion criteria from a given clinical trial, and an assessment of eligibility determines whether or not a patient meets the requirements to participate in a clinical study. Patients can only be included in clinical trials if they qualify for it based on their characteristics . This can be done by inputting the patient's characteristics, the data from an Electronic Health Record, and comparing it with the inclusion criteria from a clinical trial. Patients who meet their characteristics are eligible for a given trial, but the eligibility assessment depends on the trial eligibility and the factors that allow a person to participate in clinical trials, which is usually done in three steps . The first step of the trial is finding the information it is looking for in the clinical trial. Trial-level eligibility is an assessment to determine whether a patient meets the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial. A positive or negative assessment of eligibility determines whether a patient meets the requirements to participate in a clinical trial. The second step in the trial-level eligibility process includes checking if the patient meets the requirements of a given trial. If a patient is eligible, then the trial is still looking for him or her and if a patient is not eligible, it means he or she does not meet the inclusion criteria. The patient is not eligible anymore as they have already participated in a clinical trial that matched their requirements. When a patient is enrolled in a clinical trial, the trial's requirements are checked by the physician, and a positive or negative assessment is carried out. If a patient is not eligible for a trial based on trial-level eligibility, they are ineligible, and they will be excluded from the trial. If a patient is eligible, the patient is still interested in participating in a given trial, and the physician approves the enrollment, the trial-level eligibility check should be evaluated from a physician's perspective. The third step in trial-level eligibility is an individual patient's eligibility check.</s>",

Under the section `Eligibility criteria` I can find the information that the minimum age for enrollment is `3` years to `18`. To compare if the patient (with a 16-year-old girl) is within this age range, I go back to the Patient note and see that she is a 16-year-old girl.

Total bilirubin is 21.02 mg/dL, direct bilirubin is 2.04 mg/dL, AST is 37 U/L, ALT is 20 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is 1345 U/L, alkaline phosphatase is 531 U/L, creatinine is 0.3 mg/dL, urea is 29 mg/dL, Na is 147 mEq/L, and K is 4.5 mEq/L. According to the factors to consider for the medical history, the patient matches the exclusion criteria with the lab result. Hepatitis C is also in the factors to consider for inclusion criteria, and the patient matches the exclusion criteria with the lab result. Second, the exclusion criteria are considered: first, living donors are excluded. The patient matches this exclusion criteria. Second, a non-heart-beating donor is not allowed. The patient matches this exclusion criteria. The third, fourth, and fifth exclusion criteria regarding donor disease and HIV are also matched with the lab result. Sixth, the subject is not receiving dialysis, and the subject has not had a previous or concurrent solid or cell transplant. Finally, the subject is not receiving immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and corticosteroids. The subject is also not going to use an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Day 1 visit. Hence, the patient does not have eligible characteristics for the clinical trial.</s>",

Alternatively, if the criterion is not met, I would place 0 as the score to indicate the patient's ineligility.Given the fact that the patient is three days old, it is unlikely that the patient has a history of stroke.

It is caused by the inability of the newborn to clear the fluid-filled alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, preventing air from flowing freely into and out of the alveoli.

Firstly, it's essential to be enrolled in the CRUK-IBIS-II-DCIS study. This trial aims to look at the outcomes of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with DCIS. The subject of this trial has an invasive cancer that has not metastasized or spread outside the breast and is confirmed to have ductal carcinoma in situ by histologic examination. Although the subject was initially randomized to anastrozole, we need to consider if the patient has ductal carcinoma in situ or not, and the patient has. Then, tumor stage IIIA is required, but if this stage hasn't been reached and the next level of treatment is required, the subject is not eligible. However, the patient is said to be free of metastasis in the bone. The patient's serum alkaline phosphatase (S-ALP) exceeds 400 IU/mL, which means the patient has a greater risk of bone fractures. Because the patient reported having a headache, painful bone, and difficulty chewing , we can assume that the patient's S-ALP level exceeded 400 IU/mL and not 300 IU/L, which is the normal range (44-147 IU/L). Bone density measurements from the subject revealed a T-score of less than -4.0 or two low traumatic vertebral fractures on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) . Although there was no mention of fractures in the patient's note, we used the evidence from the clinical trial to make an inference; therefore, we thought that fractures may have occurred.</s>",

E.g. Trial-level eligibility: 1) might indicate exclusion. For me, 'eligibility' indicates a process that is more rigorous than 'inclusion criteria,' and therefore I would expect to be shown a stringent analysis. 'Evaluation' or 'assessment' might be less confusing. Secondly, I would suggest indicating the scale for assessing eligibility on each line in the 'inclusion criteria' column of Eligibility Criteria Data Collection. I noticed that you indicated a score in the header: is this an indication of the scale? The third minor comment I would like to suggest is using the word 'medical' instead of 'disease' in the heading, and I would like to ask you to use 'genetic' again instead of 'molecular,' e.g. 'evaluate whether a patient meets Molecular Genetic Inclusion Criteria' please consider changing this into 'evaluate whether a patient meets Genetic Inclusion Criteria' because of the reason you stated, i.e., 'molecular' in combination with 'disease' is confusing and 'genetic' is less confusing, since the patient has a genetic cause of retinoschisis.</s>",

It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease is characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), and postural instability, which can lead to impaired activities of daily living. Its etiology is not entirely clear, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors . There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications and surgical treatments can help control the symptoms and slow disease progression. The Parkinson's disease used in this article refers to primary Parkinson's disease, also known as idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with unknown causes. To control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, treatments, including drugs and surgery, are used . It should be noted that it is uncertain whether the patient's condition (tremors and slowness of movement) is caused by Parkinson's disease. To establish the diagnosis, further testing such as brain imaging or other specialized tests must be done .
