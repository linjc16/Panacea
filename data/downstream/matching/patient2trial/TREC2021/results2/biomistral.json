Trastuzumab will be given through the vein every 3 weeks (or every week at the doctor's discretion). The third drug, pertuzumab, is an investigational drug. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been given in studies to over 800 people. It has been effective in treating HER2 positive breast cancer.

To evaluate whether a patient meets the inclusion criteria for a clinical trial, I would compare the relevant factors mentioned in the clinical trial, such as the type of breast cancer, stage and characteristics of the tumor, other medical conditions, and other exclusion criteria, with the patient's characteristics to provide a suggestion on the patient's eligibility for the trial. In the clinical trial mentioned provided, the patient was 45 years old and female. The patient was postmenopausal with cytologically confirmed breast cancer. Based on cytomorphological assessment and breast biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with a 3 cm invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) and was HER2-positive while estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) were negative. In addition, the patient had 5 positive lymph nodes. Computed Tomography (CT) showed nodules in both lungs, which were considered to be possibly metastatic lesions. The patient was a candidate for tumor resection and chemotherapy. Based on the trial inclusion criteria, the patient's tumor was \u22645 cm and had >1 positive lymph node, meeting the first inclusion criterion. The patient met the second criterion of molecular subtype, which refers to ER/PR-negative and HER2+. Therefore, it is possible for the patient to use any type of adjuvant trastuzumab. However, the patient's tumor size was large, involving the skin, meeting the third exclusion criterion.

Next, we tagged each word using part-of-speech tagging, which assigned each word a part of speech. For this, we used the part-of-speech tagger , which is a dictionary or vocabulary that identifies individual words and phrases in a sentence and classifies them by part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and then added some custom rules such as abbreviation expansion. Then, we used dependency parsing, which parses the words into clauses and sentences. For dependency parsing, we used the SpaCy implementation of the Stanford Parser  and its Python interface. This implementation uses Python\u2019s built-in libraries to compile a finite-state parser. This parser takes the text and its grammatical structure and builds a parse tree.

Then, we can assess the trial-level eligibility as \"2) Eligible\" since the factors \"no alcohol\" and \"no smoking\" are explicitly stated in the note, and the other factors match the inclusive criteria.Finally, we look at the exclusion and inclusion criteria more carefully, and we can also tell the patient not to drink alcohol so that he or she can be sure to be included in the trial.If an element is not clear in the note or the value is unknown, it should be evaluated as \"Not relevant\" \"Not relevant\" \"Trial-level eligibility: 1) Not relevant\".

        "output": "Trial-level eligibility: 0) Excluded. A 46-year-old man presents with dizziness and frequent headaches. He has a family history of CAD, but no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and is physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53\u2009mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158\u2009mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits. The patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medications. Neck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA), as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.</s>",
