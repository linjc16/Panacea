Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA),  as well as moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50%. For the LICA, the peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cutoff values were 208.5\u2009cm/s and 54.5\u2009cm/s, respectively; RICA PSV was 91.72\u2009cm/s and RICA EDV was 37.37\u2009cm/s. Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery, which were characterized as bulky plates extending to the middle third of the internal coronary arteries (ICAs) and as predominantly echogenic and hyperechoic, with less than 50% of the area being echolucent with uneven surfaces.</s>",

To determine the patient's eligibility for a clinical trial, I will need to compare the patient's characteristics with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial. I will then assign a score of 0, 1, or 2 to each criterion based on whether the patient meets, partially meets, or does not meet the criterion, respectively. For example, if a trial's inclusion criterion is \"age \u2265 18 years,\" and the patient is 19 years old, I would assign a score of 1 to that criterion. If the patient meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, I would assign a score of 2 to the trial-level eligibility. If the patient meets some of the inclusion criteria and/or some of the exclusion criteria, I would assign a score of 1 to the trial-level eligibility. If the patient meets none of the inclusion criteria and/or meets all the exclusion criteria, I would assign a score of 0 to the trial-level eligibility.</s>",
